1,"I’m interested to hear what people think is in store for the Sand Snakes.

I personally just think the answer is...death, obviously, but I’m curious what else is out there.

I believe Lady Nym is definitely going to die.  She’s going straight into the Red Keep with Robert Strong, and no matter her prowess, Cersei is going to have her killed out of paranoia or after she’s discovered evidence of the conspiracy.  I think Nym’s death is going to be part of what causes Arianne, already married to fAegon, to send the coded message for war against her father’s wishes, just as she marries fAegon without his knowledge or consent.

Obara I think is just dead at the hands of Darkstar.  She has something grisly coming to her, being the most headstrong and (seemingly) least intelligent of the Snakes.

Tyene is probably the most interesting.  She’s entering the Sept of Baelor thinking that the High Sparrow can be manipulated.  I think she’s going to be found out by him, but whether or not he has her killed...I’m really not sure.  I suppose there’s a chance that he might work together with her, but I find that unlikely.

Ultimately I don’t see how any of them play any significant part aside from causing inciting incidents. They’re nowhere near as smart as Oberyn, and they’re going to follow their father in death trying to achieve vengeance just as he was.  I think poor Ellaria is going to be shown to be exactly right about what’s in store for them, and her relationship with Doran is going to be destroyed when she discovers that he’s been scheming for vengeance all along while showing her a totally peaceful face.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Theories on the Fate of the Sand Snakes

7,"When he chooses to betray him in favor of Cersei/Joffrey. There seem to be many potential motivating factors, and if i'm forgetting that it's explicitly stated then someone please point that out. 

1) Because Ned wishes to put Stannis on the throne and he knows that would be disastrous for him personally. 

2) Because he has always loved Cat deeply and Ned ends up married to her, so naturally he may have some bitter feelings, towards Ned and the Starks, due to his duel with Brandon as well. 

3) At the same time, he is spinning his plot to plunge Westeros into a chaotic civil war, with the Stark-Lannister rivalry being the core part. So he cannot have Ned defeating Cersei outright, as this would have the effect of basically winning the war for the Starks before it truly got underway. Whereas Cersei winning this scuffle does not quite have the same affect of winning the war for the Lannisters, since he has many cards to potentially play to easily undermine the Lannisters. The main question here is did he already plan to try and manipulate Joffrey into executing Ned, or did he in fact actually do so.

Looking through old post's about the Death of Dragons book within the Citadel, I was wondering that people are thinking now about it. From my belief, it cannot be about killing dragons, as that is rather simple, as shown in the Dance of the Dragons, and with Meraxes in Dorne. If Jaqen wants the book to learn how to hatch a dragon egg that Euron may have paid for, who do they plan to become it's dragonrider, and they would know they would have to wait a few years for the dragon to grow to a proper size, and this is not accounting for how the Braavosi may view them for this. 

One theory I had is that it is a guide to properly raising dragons and using them, not just for war, but also for other things, things I have no idea about. Perhaps how to bond with them, how to give them the best diet, how to control them from attacking random people, such as the little girl Hazzea, though I dont believe Drogon did it.

Yes, this is yet another Benjen post. Yes, this is yet another Ashara post. But hear me out.

&gt;If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty, might she have looked to me instead of **Stark?**
The Kingbreaker, ADWD

Emphasis mine. Much has been made of the identity of the mysterious Stark. The main candidates among the fandom are Ned and Brandon. But both have rather significant issues.

#The Case For Ned 
Indeed, Ned is the one who most think got with Ashara at Harrenhal, to the point where even common maids believe it.

&gt;Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. [...] they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes.
Catelyn II, AGOT 

Even Cersei fookin Lannister knows about the rumor. And if that doesn't demonstrate it's common enough knowledge, I don't know what does.

&gt;Who was the mother, I wonder? Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned? A whore? Or was it the grieving sister, the **Lady Ashara**? She threw herself into the sea, I'm told. Why was that? For the brother you slew, or the child you stole? Tell me, my honorable Lord Eddard, how are you any different from Robert, or me, or Jaime?""
Eddard XII, AGOT

And yet, Ned *never* thinks of her in his Chapters. And before you mention Rhaegar and R+L=J, he thinks about him plenty, he just doesn't remember what he was like specifically. 

&gt;Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself **recalling** Rhaegar Targaryen.
Eddard VIII, AGOT 

&gt;For the first time in years, he found himself **remembering** Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not.
Eddard IX, AGOT 

Contrast that with how Ashara doesn't come up once. He danced with her at Harrenhal, sure.

&gt;The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword [Kingsguard], a red snake, [Oberyn Martell] and the lord of griffins, [Jon Connington] and lastly with the quiet wolf [Ned]. . . 
Bran II, ASOS 

But if he fathered her stillborn daughter, surely Ned would think of her while say, in the black cells. Sure, Edric Dayne thinks they were in love courtesy of his aunt Allyria (more on her later), but he also thinks Wylla was Jon's mother, so he isn't a 100% reliable source. And finally, it seems like he was with Howland at the time.

The quiet wolf [Ned] had offered the little crannogman a place in his tent that night, but before he slept he knelt on the lakeshore, looking across the water to where the Isle of Faces would be, and said a prayer to the old gods of north and Neck . . .""
Bran II, ASOS 

#The Case For Brandon 
The school of thought regarding Brandon is that he's order, more confident, and ""not shy of taking what he wanted"". Lending credibility to this is that he got Ashara to dance with Ned in the first place, as the latter was too shy.

&gt;The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf . . . **but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.**
Bran II, ASOS 

The main problem with this theory is that, according to Barbrey Dustin, she and Brandon were in love.

&gt;The lantern light in her eyes made them seem as if they were afire. ""Brandon was fostered at Barrowton with old Lord Dustin, the father of the one I'd later wed, but he spent most of his time riding the Rills. He loved to ride. His little sister took after him in that. A pair of centaurs, those two. And my lord father was always pleased to play host to the heir to Winterfell. My father had great ambitions for House Ryswell. He would have served up my maidenhead to any Stark who happened by, but there was no need. Brandon was never shy about taking what he wanted. I am old now, a dried-up thing, too long a widow, but I still remember the look of my maiden's blood on his cock the night he claimed me. I think Brandon liked the sight as well. A bloody sword is a beautiful thing, yes. It hurt, but it was a sweet pain.

""The day I learned that Brandon was to marry Catelyn Tully, though … there was nothing sweet about that pain. He never wanted her, I promise you that. He told me so, on our last night together … but Rickard Stark had great ambitions too. Southron ambitions that would not be served by having his heir marry the daughter of one of his own vassals. Afterward my father nursed some hope of wedding me to Brandon's brother Eddard, but Catelyn Tully got that one as well. I was left with young Lord Dustin, until Ned Stark took him from me.""
The Turncloak, ADWD 


Of course, Barbrey isn't exactly an impartial source, and it's certainly possible Brandon wasn't the type to stick to one woman, but this seemed like a more long term thing than a one night stand. And would Brandon really have slept with the girl he tried to set his brother up with? I think not.

#The Case For Benjen 
At first glance, this may seem like a ridiculous notion. Benjen was 14 at the time of the tourney! Except, it seems like Ashara was around that age as well. This post (https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/48w8eb/spoilers_everything_a_close_examination_of_the/) is the best calculation of Ashara and her family's ages I've seen, and places Ashara's birth around 263; the same age as Ned, and only three years older than Ben. So the age doesn't seem to be much of a factor. 

We know he was just a little younger than Jon when he first got drunk, and Harrenhal seems like a likely place for it to happen. Him hooking up with Ashara while drunk seems possible.

Let's move on to Ashara's daughter.

&gt;Even after all these years, Ser Barristan could still recall Ashara's smile, the sound of her laughter. He had only to close his eyes to see her, with her long dark hair tumbling about her shoulders and those haunting purple eyes. Daenerys has the same eyes. Sometimes when the queen looked at him, he felt as if he were looking at **Ashara's daughter**…

But Ashara's daughter had been stillborn, and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon after, mad with grief for the child she had lost, and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at Harrenhal as well. 
The Kingbreaker, ADWD 

Allyria being the supposedly stillborn daughter of Ashara is a common enough theory (the link above shows that she was born around the right time), so I'm not going to delve deep into it here. But there's an interesting quote by Benjen that could relate to this. 

&gt;""You might, if you knew what it meant,"" Benjen said. ""If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.""

Jon felt anger rise inside him. ""I'm not your son!""

Benjen Stark stood up. ""More's the pity."" He put a hand on Jon's shoulder. ""Come back to me after you've fathered a few bastards of your own, and we'll see how you feel.""
Jon I, AGOT

As this post shows (https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ewfj9r/why_benjen_stark_joined_the_nights_watch_spoilers/), Benjen very likely knew about R+L=J, and possibly took the black because of the guilt of helping Lyanna. If Ashara killed herself, a dead brother and an as good as dead lover would be a decent reason to do it.

#Conclusion 

In the end, this is obviously a very tinfoily theory, and someone in the comments will probably debunk it soundly. But it was fun to write. What do you think of it?",asoiaf,"""Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up."" Could Ashara Have Looked to Benjen?"

In Sansa’s first chapter in A Clash of Kings she is now a hostage to King Joffrey and is forced to sit with him for his nameday tournament. Cersei is busy preparing for war and her three children are having a discussion about Tommen wanting to go on a mock jousting ride for fun.

It’s the only conversation we witness between Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen. It’s sweet how Myrcella defends her younger brother. This shows she doesn’t let Joffrey intimidate them and has a quick wit. This exchange is hilarious.

&gt; “I’m supposed to ride against the straw man.”  
 [Joffrey]“Not today.”  
“But I want to ride!”  
“I don’t care what you want.”  
“Mother said I could ride.”  
“She said,” Princess Myrcella agreed.  
“Mother said,” mocked the king. “Don’t be childish.”  
“We’re children,” Myrcella declared haughtily. “We’re supposed to be childish.”  
The Hound laughed. “She has you there.”  
Joffrey was beaten.  
“Very well. Even my brother couldn’t tilt any worse than these others.
Master, bring out the quintain, Tommen wants to be a gnat.”  
Tommen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied, his chubby little legs pumping hard.  
“Luck,” Sansa called to him.

37,"Arya Stark.

I know, it sounds insane, but hear me out.

• Sansa is listed as a ""Sister of Winterfell"" and Arya is mentioned as a ""daughter of Winterfell"" in the books. 
• Furthermore, there are a few potential connections: One is that both Sansa and Arya are from Winterfell 
• Sansa is the ward of Winterfell and most likely to be the child of the Stark lineage.
• both had an uncle named Eddard (House Stark's heir) killed by Joffrey Baratheon
• both were born to Robb Stark's widow Catelyn Tully

How does this mean that Arya and Sansa are sisters?  Well, it means that Sansa is at least as close as Arya as the Nightsister prophecy implies. The prophecy is as follows: 

&gt; Bran must be the child of the seven and the three (Bran, Jon Snow, Meera Reed), and of the horn that must not quake. He must be the great hero, the true Stark. His name is the true Starks' king.
&gt; Arya Stark must be a girl. 
&gt; Tyrion must be the child of the fire that never burns, and the water that never runs. 
&gt; And Hodor must be the child of the fiery wind, and Hodor's the fire that never burns.
&gt; No direwolf will save you. No knight will save you. 

— AFFC, The Pointy End

This isn't an isolated statement. If Sansa fails the task of avenging Bran, she becomes Bran's sister and, therefore, he becomes Arya's brother. If she succeeds, Sansa becomes a Winterfell maiden with a brother's name.

More proof Arya and Sansa are sisters: 

1. A clever girl is a clever sister. 
2. You can't spy on someone while wearing their most hated accessory. 
3. Those who do keep a kennel are not worthy to be called brothers. — Maisie Williams (@MissMaisie) July 28, 2017
4. Little girls look very similar to older girls. This does not apply to Littlefinger, who is white, blonde, and has white-blonde hair like a man.

P.S. ""All these leeches are yours?"" - Hard to tell because of his glasses, but who the hell is Lysa talking about here? She means that Robin Arryn and Sansa are cousins. You know who else are cousins? Arya and Robin Arryn.

I know the theory that Arya and Sansa are sisters is most likely more compelling and poetic, but you don't have to agree, nor do you have to refute it. You have a choice.

He was hideously deformed, had dragon-like scales, small learher wings and a stub of a tail, but later in her dream he is a healthy man, until he starts breathing fire. Daenerys believes herself to be infertile due to Maegi’s impossible prophecy, however she seems to have miscarriage in her final chapter in ADwD. And Maegi’s seemingly impossible prophecy starts coming to fruition (sun rising in west and setting in east- Quentyn, seas going dry- winter/dry season in Dothraki sea, mountains blowing in the wind like leaves- masters’ pyramids being burned in Astapor and then by her dragons in Meeren). But then if Daenerys will be able to give birth again, will she be able to give birth to a normal child now, after being tainted by dark magic, or will rather all her children be as monstrous as Rhaego? 
What will be with Jon, assuming he will be resurrected? What do children of fire wights look like? Maegor the Cruel was almost certainly a fire wight. After a trial of seven he was in coma for 28 days when Alys Harroway brought him Tyanna of the Tower and on the next day Maegor woke up. But Tyanna was a sorceress and neither Maesters nor septons could help him. How else could she save him than by resurrecting him? Also after waking up from coma Maegor bacame much more cruel than before. Now Maegor’s children- Tyanna admitted that she poisoned Maegor’s children in their mothers’ wombs, but that was what she said while being tortured and that was what Maegor was expecting to hear. She probably meant something different, that he was in denial of- she poisoned his genitals by resurrecting him. Soon later Maegor was found dead on Iron Throne and while his death could have other reasons as well, I believe he was broken after finding out he will never be able to have offspring and commuted suicide. Maegors children: with Jeyne Westerling-legless and armless with both male and female genitalia, with Elinor Costayne- eyeless with small wings, with Alys Harroway- eyeless and twisted mostrosity. Child of Alys is the only one that doesn’t seem any dragon-like, child of Jeyne is particularly interesting- Septon Barth claims in his Unnatural History that dragons are neither male or female and can shift sexes, and he can be considered reliable since he was Jaehaerys’ dear friend and therefore was able to study dragons.
All those children appear to be half-human half-dragon, but what will happen if two such people mate? Romance of Jon and Daenerys is one thing from show that is almost certain, but what will their offspring look like? Will it be almost dragon or a proper dragon? Septon Barth theorizes that bloodmages of Valyria created dragons using wyverns, but what if they dragons were actually product of breeding of fire wights, creatures of pure fire?

44,"One of my favourite Jamie scenes on the show,was the one where he confesses to Myrcella that he’s her father before she dies in his arms. Ofc then I started reading the books and I realised Tommen &amp; Myrcella were still alive so obviously that scene didn’t exist, but I was always curious about Jamie’s relationship with his children so with reading his thoughts, I could have a much better idea of how he truly feels about them. 

When he learns about Joffrey’s death, although he’s aware that his son has died, he seems more concerned about how Cersei’s handling his passing the actual loss itself.

&gt; Jaime sat silent through it all, letting the words wash over him, a horn of ale forgotten in his one good hand. Joffrey. My blood. My firstborn. My son. He tried to bring the boy's face to mind, but his features kept turning into Cersei's. She will be in mourning, her hair in disarray and her eyes red from crying, her mouth trembling as she tries to speak. 

He mentally corrects Cersei when she’s talking about Joffrey to him as if he was just HER son.

&gt; ""You should have come sooner,"" she murmured, when he took her in his arms. ""Why couldn't you have come sooner, to keep him safe? My boy . . .""
&gt; Our boy.

But it seems that he thinks this out of possessiveness, and not out of actual love or grief for a son. He wanted Cersei to talk to him about Joffrey as a mother would to the father of her children, but he doesn’t seem to have any paternal feelings for Joffrey like an actual father would, admitting he’d prefer to get his hand back rather than his son. 
&gt; And now he's dead. He pictured Joff lying still and cold with a face black from poison, and still felt nothing. Perhaps he was the monster they claimed. If the Father Above came down to offer him back his son or his hand, Jaime knew which he would choose. He had a second son, after all, and seed enough for many more. If Cersei wants another child I'll give her one . . . and this time I'll hold him, and the Others take those who do not like it.

He’s more than willing to give Cersei more children if that’s what she desires, but he seems to only think about them as a way to please Cersei. Even his wanting of actually holding his child, I feel that comes more of a desire for the world to know about their relationship more than anything else. 
He appears totally disconnected from any paternal feelings, talking to Cersei about having another son thinking this would somehow make her forget Joffrey’s death.


&gt; Marry me, Cersei. Stand up before the realm and say it's me you want. We'll have our own wedding feast, and make another son in place of Joffrey.""
&gt; She drew back. ""That's not funny.""

I suppose though that someone could say he didn’t care about Joffrey because he was aware of his evil nature. He certainly thinks his death was deserved. 

&gt; ""You say Sansa killed him. Why protect her?""

&gt; Because Joff was no more to me than a squirt of seed in Cersei's cunt. And because he deserved to die.

But despite his knowing of Joffrey being a terrible person, he was willing to have his only daughter, who's a kind hearted girl, married to him if that would make it easier for him and Cersei to be together publicly. 

&gt; Why shouldn't I marry Cersei openly and share her bed every night? The dragons always married their sisters. Septons, lords, and smallfolk had turned a blind eye to the Targaryens for hundreds of years, let them do the same for House Lannister. It would play havoc with Joffrey's claim to the crown, to be sure, but in the end it had been swords that had won the Iron Throne for Robert, and swords could keep Joffrey there as well, regardless of whose seed he was. We could marry him to Myrcella, once we've sent Sansa Stark back to her mother. (Jamie III, ASOS) 

So, it’s not just Joffrey he couldn’t care less about. He  doesn’t seem to particularly care for the rest of his children either and blames Cersei for it when she asks him to be there for Tommen. 

&gt; ""He is your son . . .""

&gt; ""He is my seed. He's never called me Father. No more than Joffrey ever did. You warned me a thousand times never to show any undue interest in them.""

Well, I have no love for Cersei Lannister. But in this case she was just being reasonable? She was only trying to protect her children, herself and Jamie from Robert’s wrath and a certain death was he to find out.It’s not like she had a choice and didn’t allow Jamie to be a father to them. Didn’t he know about the circumstances from the start? 

&gt; ""Tommen is no son of mine, no more than Joffrey was."" His voice was hard. ""You made them Robert's too.""

But Robert is dead. He could just accept the office of Hand that Cersei offered to him and actually be there for his 9-year-old son, build a relationship with him.He has already lost a hand, his glory days as a knight are over anyway. Yet he chooses to leave and go to Riverrun. 

&gt; My place is with my king. With my son. Would Tommen want to know that? The truth could cost the boy his throne. Would you sooner have a father or a chair, lad? Jaime wished he knew the answer. He does like stamping papers with his seal. The boy might not even believe him, to be sure. Cersei would say it was a lie. My sweet sister, the deceiver. He would need to find some way to winkle Tommen from her clutches before the boy became another Joffrey.

And then,he regrets leaving because he belongs in King’s Landing and even thinks about telling Tommen the truth about his parentage. 

Honestly, I don’t know what to think of Jamie.It's obvious he's kind of torn himself on that matter. Is he a tragic figure who wants to be a good father and isn't allowed to?Or he just wants to think so when in reality he’s too selfish and self absorbed to really care about his own flesh and blood and wouldn’t be a much better father than Robert even if the circumstances were different?",asoiaf,Jamie as a father(SPOILERS EXTENDED)
45,"This post is probably useless, considering it's about a mystery no one can really answer ... There are almost as many theories as there are fans, and I think even the creator (all praise Gurrm) isn't sure of the answer.

So of course you know the combination of vowels ""ae"" as it appears in Valyrian naming convention.

People pronounce it all kinds of ways, but given the existence of ""Dunk and Egg"", we can likely deduce it is supposed to make an ""eh"" sound. (Ennis, Emmon, Eggon)

Walder Frey should have named a son Jaehaerys rather than Rhaegar, because the former is probably pronounced ""Jeh-heh-ress"" and it would roll right off his tongue. 8 )

But, speaking of Rhaegar ... does the presence of ""Rh"" transform the ""ae"" from an ""eh"" sound to an ""ay"" sound? (Rennis, Rella, Reggar vs Rayness, Raylah, Raygar)

I tend to imagine it doesn't, because I prefer to keep some kind of mental consistency ... but I'm not sure, because the name ""Rhae"" exists in-universe, and I think we're supposed to hear it in our minds as ""Ray"" and not ""R'eh.""

Also it seems his Shaggydog acts more Malevolent than the other Direwolves. Also Rickon is the youngest of the Stark wargs and has the least control over his wolf. This pairing leaves Rickon vulnerable to having his personality blending with that of Shaggydogs I believe.

58,"After months of anxiety and planning, Stannis finally reaches King's Landing.  Knights and men-at-arms man the walls and highborn ladies and older lords retreat to Maegor's Holdfast to be hosted by Queen Cersei.  In deference to her status as the King's betrothed, Sansa is seated beside her future mother-in-law and she is the POV witness for Cersei's behaviour during the night.

Justifiably terrified of the man, it doesn't take Sansa long to notice the presence of Ser Ilyn Payne, and to question Cersei as to her intentions. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “Why is Ser Ilyn here?” Sansa blurted out.    
&gt;  
&gt;The queen glanced at the mute headsman. “To deal with treason, and **to defend us if need be**. He was a knight before he was a headsman.” She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall, where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred. “**When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad of him**.” 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems a rational justification, though it is unclear how useful Ser Ilyn would be against an unknown number of potential turncloaks.  Cersei does seem to have a deal of respect for Ser Ilyn's capacity to terrify without violence and a Valaryian steel greatsword would likely be very effective against guards who might not be highly trained and likely be leaving out of self-preservation.  

However, after imbibing what Sansa thinks is a large amount of wine (though Cersei seems to think she is still clear-headed), and demanding that Sansa drink more wine than she wants to, Cersei maliciously tells Sansa: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, **I lied to you**. Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he’s really here?”   
&gt;  
&gt;She did not dare answer, but it did not matter. The queen raised a hand and beckoned, never waiting for a reply. Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat. He carried Ice unsheathed. Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man’s head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious. There was blood drying on the rippling steel, the red already fading to brown. “Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us,” said Cersei.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ser Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle. His pox-scarred face had no expression.   
&gt;  
&gt;“**He’s here for us, he says**,” the queen said. “**Stannis may take the city and he may take the throne, but I will not suffer him to judge me. I do not mean for him to have us alive**.”   
&gt;  
&gt;*“Us?”*   
&gt;  
&gt;“You heard me. So perhaps you had best pray again, Sansa, and for a different outcome. The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you.” 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is whether or not people believe this is Cersei's true intention?  Ser Ilyn is clearly incapable of explaining his presence to Sansa himself, and would likely never contradict Cersei regardless.  It also seems like something Cersei is saying to hurt Sansa in the moment, because she can.

My reasoning for doubting the truth of this is Cersei's later abrupt exit and that Sansa is so little regarded at this time that she can return to her room essentially unobserved.  I also feel that the Cersei we meet in her POV chapters would probably think herself fearless enough to do something this pragmatic, but has a very strong sense of survival and is not as brave as she thinks she is.  Also, there is something somewhat rude about Ser Ilyn not cleaning his sword if he might need to mercy-kill a queen, but not an issue if he only means to cut down turncloak guards and servants.

What do you think?

Sorry this is a bit all over the place.  This is my first post longer than one sentence!

60,"Thanks, team",asoiaf,"How far apart are the events of “A Game of Thrones” and “Clash of Kings”? I am about to finish “A Game of Thrones” and I tried looking for the answers online and couldn’t find any. Also, what is the best ASOIAF book?"
62,"I posted a long time ago about how dire the situation the Jaime and Brienne are walking into with Lady Stoneheart and the Brotherhood without Banners. It is probably one of my favorite plot points to discuss regarding the series due to my desire for both Jaime/Brienne to survive, but also my recognition of the fact that TWOW is going to be a really dark book.

**Help me construct a theory in which Jaime/Brienne survive the encounter with Lady Stoneheart and the Brotherhood that is realistic and can fit in some way most of the criteria below**

***

**Brienne/Jaime return immediately and alone to TBWB** 

- Ser Hyle/Pod are captive and the BWB has shown they are willing to kill them

- Brienne has essentially sworn to kill Jaime (saying [sword](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6425/) in return for Pod/Hyle's life)

- Brienne lies and says the Hound has Sansa and he must come alone

**Brienne/Jaime don't defeat TBWB**

- They are severely outnumbered

 - Jaime only has one hand (even if he is getting better)

- Brienne was just on her deathbed from her fight with Rorge/Biter


**Lady Stoneheart doesn't decide to be merciful**

- She only cares about finding her daughters/killing Lannisters &amp; Freys 

- Mother Merciless is one of her names

- She has the Lannister she hates most of all in front of her now

 Please also keep in mind one of the last things she heard before death is:

&gt;A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to Robb. ""**Jaime Lannister sends his regards.**"" He thrust his longsword through her son's heart, and twisted. -ASOS, Catelyn VII

**The Brotherhood doesn't turn on Lady Stoneheart**

- Most/all of the members who disagreed with her actions left (ex: Edric Dayne)

***

#Possible Evidence of Them Surviving

&gt;**In his dreams the dead came burning, gowned in swirling green flames. Jaime danced around them with a golden sword**, but for every one he struck down two more arose to take his place.  -ASOS, Jaime II

and:

&gt;The steel links parted like silk. **""A sword,"" Brienne begged, and there it was, scabbard, belt, and all. She buckled it around her thick waist. The light was so dim that Jaime could scarcely see her, though they stood a scant few feet apart. In this light she could almost be a beauty, he thought. In this light she could almost be a knight. Brienne's sword took flame as well, burning silvery blue. The darkness retreated a little more.** -ASOS, Jaime VI

Both passages seem to indicate Jaime/Brienne fighting in the Battle for the Dawn, but they also can be as a possible Trial by Combat, etc. with the Brotherhood.

***

#Possible Solutions

- **Brienne sings for LSH**: u/Wild2098

- **They use Jaime to get into the Red Wedding 2.0** (But its going to be at Riverrun and they already have Tom O' Seven inside)

- **Brienne dies and is resurrected**

- **Trial by Combat in which Brienne defeats a BWB member**

- **Magical intervention** (Bran/Bloodraven, fire magic/""R'hllor"", etc.)

I honestly wouldn't mind any of these , I just don't want to see some deus ex machina trash (something like Jaime having brought some Lannister men along secretly, which still wouldn't make sense bc its not like the BWB doesn't have eyes on Brienne/Jaime as she went into their camp at Pennytree) but GRRM doesn't seem to write like that.

Also keep in mind:

- Brienne asks for a ""sword"" in AFFC, Brienne VIII which takes place on/around 5/17/300

- Jaime disappears with Brienne in ADWD, Jaime I which takes place on/around 5/23/300

- Cersei receives word that Jaime disappeared with some woman in ADWD, Cersei II which takes place on/around 6/19/300

- Cersei/Kevan are still wondering about Jaime's whereabouts in the ADWD, Epilogue which takes place on/around 6/28/300

***

My personal thought for what happens leading up to the climax of this plotline is that Jaime will demand a Trial by Combat (like the Hound/Tyrion did, even Merrett got a ""trial"") and then he is either going to have to face Brienne or Brienne is going to be his champion. From there I go back and forth a lot on what I think happens next.

64,"I am obsessively checking the news every day for Winds of Winter updates (bad idea I know), but that aside, all sources seem to be feeding off the Welt interview as the latest thing GRRM said about it.  Wasn’t this interview conducted many, many months ago?  I thought I read he was actually interviewed half a year ago and they just published it a couple weeks ago.  

Wouldn’t the latest news be that he’s back home, only posting routine stuff (and only sparingly on NotABlog), and that that’s a pretty big hint he’s going hard on finishing TWOW right now?  Or am I just as delusionally hopeful as many have been and need my soul crushed again?",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] When was the Welt interview actually conducted?
65,"Hey everyone! I started reading ASoIaF about two months ago and it was an amazing experience! I had, unfortunately, watched the show before. But a lot of things were still very surprising for me. After reading, I went and started to do a lot of research about this world. I read wikis and forums, went on Quora, here and a lot of places on the net. And I read fan theories. I have to say, some people really have a keen sense about these things, it's bewildering. And that's what this post is about- my doubts regarding some of the major fan theories.

I'm just gonna skip the theories that the show already confirmed/shot down. This includes R+L=J, Benjen is Coldhands, Danny's descent, etc.

So, let's get to the biggest one: Aegon Blackfyre. This I've makes a lot of sense. It ties in to the Wars of the Roses parallel. It describes Varys's motivations sufficiently. I just have a question: Why is Aegon supposed to be Illyrio's kid? When has there ever been a mention of Serra? Why can't it be Varys's own son? He could've been gelded after Aegon's conception (or not at all, and he's only pretending to be a eunuch). As to why Illyrio is helping, it could be to get indirect control over Westeros, or some kind of repayment to Varys. Why is the entire community so set on this?

Then there's the Tyrion Targaryen theory. Even if this has some evidence for it, (flimsy imo) what narrative purpose would that serve? GRRM doesn't do this but reveals just because, you know?

Now this is the most confusing theory for me: The Faceless Men engineered the Doom of Valyria? I can see why: Valyrians were getting too powerful so the Faceless Men want to end them, Ra's Al Ghul style. But how?! How in seven hells does one make an earthquake and a volcanic eruption happen?! Sorcery could be done, but from what we've read so far, the world is kinda low on magic and fantasy stuff. And if you argue that magic was indeed used, then how did Valyrian sorcerors not detect and prevent this? They had some pretty strong ones, I think. And again, I must ask, what is the narrative purpose of this? It could be that Arya's disillusionment with the Faceless Men starts with her discovering this. If that's the case, then I think the show did it better. Having to kill a completely innocent person just because someone else hates him/her is much more personal. But that's just my opinion.

That's all the questions I can think of right now. Please do answer them, I'll be so grateful. If there are any other theories you think I should know about, do tell. Also, please note, I'm in the middle of the Dunk and Egg novellas right now, so please don't spoil them.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Main] A newcomer's fan theory questions

69,"I just thought of this 5 minutes ago, sorry if it has been explained.

After being made a landed knight thanks to his deeds at the siege of Storm‘s End, it is said Davos became one of Stannis‘ most loyal supporters. He was later also given command of a war galley.

In ACOK Davos I, Stannis is made aware of the Onion Knight‘s illiteracy, but doesn‘t seem to be too concerned.

Even after making Davos Hand of the King, Stannis himself doesn‘t make Davos learn reading and writing.

It seems odd to me that such a pragmatic man would overlook the importance of his Hand being able to communicate in a written way. 

Any thoughts?

Again, quite possible that I forgot something.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Published] Why didn‘t Stannis have Davos learn reading and writing?
70,"In the first two books of the series, we see Daenerys grit it out through horrific circumstances—a forced marriage, her brother’s death, her husband’s death, her baby’s death, leading her people across the Red Waste, multiple assassination attempts, duplicity in Qarth, etc. Through it all, she is strong for her people. 

Then she gets on a boat and goes to Slaver’s Bay, and we see the advent of a new, and fairly annoying, verbal tic: “I am only a young girl.”

The first time it’s actually pretty funny. She’s treating with the Stormcrows. “Five hundred of your Stormcrows against ten thousand of my Unsullied. I am only a young girl and do not understand the ways of war, yet these odds seem poor to me.” She uses the same line later on with the Second Sons, and again ironically later in the same section. It’s clearly a joke. 

But as it goes on, it becomes less of a negotiating barb and more of a verbal crutch she uses when people annoy her. She uses the phrase repeatedly in ADWD.

As she uses it more and more, she even starts to internalize it as a kind of excuse. “Young girls can change their minds,” she tells herself, when she decides to stop avoiding Daario. It even starts influencing how others see her — Quentyn and Barristan both pick up the phrase, and start thinking of Dany in those terms. Galazza Galare deploys it to try and convince Dany to marry Hizdar. 

What started out as an act to pull a fast one on some sellswords has become a reality: Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Mother is Dragons, has begun to think of herself, and be treated as, “only a young girl.”

The final time she says it, it’s in her hallucination when she’s dehydrated in the Dothraki Sea. Jorah is admonishing her for not going to Westeros. She tells him she was tired. “I am only a young girl” she tells Jorah. “No,” he replies. “You are the blood of the dragon.”

My question is, why does Dany start using this irritating phrase ad nauseum? Is it *supposed* to annoy us as readers? Does it indicate a break with her prior character — the young queen who was so committed to seeing her people through the Red Waste? Will she keep using this obnoxious phrase in TWOW (I might have to punch myself) or will she retire it having finally been reminded that she’s a dragon?

*""The ice pressed close around them, and he could feel the cold seeping into his bones, the weight of the Wall above his head. It felt like walking down the gullet of an ice dragon"" (Jon VIII ASOS).* 

I will be deconstructing and evaluating one of my favorite theories in the fandom: The Ice Dragon Theory. This theory has been around for a long time, so I certainly cannot take credit for it. However, I wanted to produce my evaluation of the theory and provide my evidence for why it should be considered and more widely accepted theory due to the level of textual evidence, narrative themes, and logical reasoning as to why it makes sense.

What is **The Ice Dragon Theory**?

In short, The Ice Dragon Theory states that there is an Ice Dragon frozen in The Wall that borders the Seven Kingdoms from the North. 

**The Magic of the Wall**

We know that The Wall is more than just ice and stone (to quote Benjen from the show). In *The World of Ice and Fire,* Maester Yandel states, “the children of the forest .. would contribute their **magic** to the construction \[of the wall\]” (TWOIAF).

Then there is **The Black Gate** that we see in *A Storm of Swords,* which clearly has magical properties of its own. 

*The* [*magical*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Magic) *Black Gate is a hidden subterranean gate that allows passage to the other side of the Wall and is as old as the Wall itself. It is set deep in a wall of the well at the center of the kitchens and is made of white* [*weirwood*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Weirwood) *with a face on it. The face is old, pale, shrunken, and wrinkled with white eyes. The door glows.*

*When someone approaches the Black Gate, the eyes open. They are white and blind, and then the door asks, ""Who are you?"" A man of the Night's Watch must repeat a part of his* [*vow*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_Watch#Vows)*, ""I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers. I am the shield that guards the realms of men."" The door will open then, saying, ""Then pass."" The door's lips open wider and wider still until nothing remains but a great gaping mouth in a ring of wrinkles*

So, I’m going to go ahead and call this magic. Furthermore, Coldhands informs Sam and Gilly that he cannot pass the wall due to runes in the wall that keep him from passing.

We also have a somewhat newer revelation that came out in *Fire and Blood* in a letter that Queen Alysanne wrote back to King Jaeharys I where she states that she attempted to fly her dragon Silverwing over the wall, but he kept turning back, refusing to fly past it.

**Bottom line: The Wall is, in fact, more than just stone and ice, there is a magic barrier of some sort.**

Now that we have established and provided evidence for the fact that the Wall is a physical and metaphysical barrier, **what on Planetos is supplying the magic maintaining a 700 foot high, 300-mile long magical barrier?**

I think it is important to clarify that magic in this world always comes with a price, and it is always high. Dany unknowingly sacrifices the **life of her unborn** child to ‘save’ Drogo. Then she burns his body and uses **Mirri Maz Duur** as a human sacrifice to birth her Dragons. Followers of R’hllor use **human sacrifice** and the blood of royalty to perform magical feats. Craster gives his sons to The Other’s to keep them at bay.

Magic. Comes. With. A. Price. 

So what could be sustaining the magic of the Wall?

**Dragons and Their Magical Influence**

Dragons are fire made flesh, intensely magical creatures. Following their return at the end of *A Game of Thrones*, the Pyromancer of Kings Landing site that their abilities have seemingly been stronger lately. 

It is specifically noted in Tyrion XI ACOK that the pyromancers came out thousands of jars of wildfire ahead of their best prediction for how many they would be able to supply. It is stated that their runes and spells are working stronger as of late. The pyromancer being questioned then specifically asks if there are any dragons around, as it is said the pyromancers magic used to be stronger when the dragons were around. 

The Warlocks of Qarth attempt to trap her and Drogon in the House of the Undying due to their magic being stronger around the Dragons.

So, we certainly have evidence that Dragons can and are used as a sort of magical battery in the main series of *A Song of Ice and Fire.* 

Thus, a dragon as the magical battery of the runes that guard the wall makes quite a lot of sense. 

We have now determined that; 

1. The Wall is a magical barrier.
2. Magic requires a great cost or power source.
3. Not only do dragons logically make sense as a power source, but we see them used in such a way in the main series.

This is all well and good and it builds a good basis that there may be an Ice Dragon in the Wall. However, we need more evidence to really call this theory plausible. Let’s take a look at textual and narrative evidence. 

**The Horn of Winter**

If we are discussing the potential end-state circumstances of the Wall, we really should talk about a piece of Wall lore that seems to specifically deal with that; The Horn of Winter.

Thousands of years ago, [Joramun](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joramun), a [King-Beyond-the-Wall](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/King-Beyond-the-Wall), supposedly blew the horn and woke [giants](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Giants) from the earth. [Free folk](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Free_folk) believe that blowing the horn can bring down the [Wall](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wall).

In *A Storm of Swords,* Mance Rayder actually threatens Jon that he will blow the horn and bring down the wall if the Nights Watch does not let them past. Now, Mance, of course, does not have the real horn.

The real horn of winter was found in *A Clash of Kings.* In *A Clash of Kings* the Nights Watch visits the fist of the first men. While there, they dig up and old satchel that has is full of dragon glass arrowheads and an old broken horn. Jon actually does try to blow the horn, but it makes no sound. He then gives the horn to Sam, who states in *ASOS Sam II* that he still has it. Presumably, he still has the Horn in Oldtown.

**Well, Jon blew the horn and nothing happened, so this isn’t the Horn of Winter, right?**

Well, maybe. However, remember, *the horn is described as broken.* If something is broken, perhaps it simply needs to be fixed. George making the decision to give the horn to Sam sure does seem to be an interesting decision, as Sam ends up in Oldtown where the wealth of knowledge of the Maester’s is available. It seems possible if ever there were a place to find information on fixing a magical horn, it would probably be in Oldtown. 

Sam having the horn in Oldtown also is very likely to cross his path with another character who has what is for sure some kind of magical horn.

**Euron Greyjoy and Dragonbinder.**

In AFFC, Euron Greyjoy shows up to the Kingsmoot with a giant ornamented horn covered in Valyrian glyphs and writing. He calls the horn “Dragonbinder”. He claims that, when blown, the horn binds the will of a dragon to the blower. One of his men, Cragorn, blows the horn:

The Glyphs glow red-hot and then white-hot

The horn's noise sounds like the screaming of a thousand souls and it seems to listeners as if their very bones are aflame and searing their flesh from within. [Cragorn](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cragorn), the man who blows the horn for Euron, collapses with blisters on his lips, and the tattoo he has of a bird on his chest is bleeding (Bloodraven-Euron suggestion). 

Cragorn later dies and when the Maester’s cut him open, they find that his lungs are charred black as soot.

So, this horn is magic (at least in some way).

Whether or not Dragonbinder will actually possess the ability to control dragons remains to be seen. However, we do also have Dany think this to herself in Dany X ADWD;

*""The dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous* *horns"" (Dany X ADWD).*

Now, the Horn of Winter is in Oldtown and in the immediate pathway of Euron Greyjoy, who could very easily serve as a potential Night King figure in the story. 

**Magical Horns in the story**

So, we have a claim that the Horn of Winter is a magic horn that will wake giants from the earth and bring down the wall.

The only other magic horn we see in the story is allegedly able to bind the will a dragon to the user. 

We know that magic requires a costly price or a great power source.

We have seen dragons used as a power source in the story. 

The HoW is currently in the pathway of a very likely candidate for fulfilling the Night King role in the story. 

Could the Horn of Winter truly be an ancient Dragon horn? Will the dragon horn mechanic finally bring down The Wall by awakening an Ice Dragon trapped inside? And will this serve as our ""waking giants from the earth""?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) The Wall Will Fall: The Horn of Winter Will Awake an Ice Dragon

79,"So I recently purchased The World of Ice &amp; Fire, after having read Fire &amp; Blood and rereading the five  ASOIAF books.

When I got to the chapter about The Conquest (page 31), I noticed what I think is a severe editing mistake.

You see, I knew before reading that Maester Yandel is a stand-in for E&amp;L and that Archmaester Gyldayn is GRRM. And I knew that many sections from TWOIAF were written by GRRM as Gyldayn. But I was under the impression that Gyldayn's writings were found by Yandel and included in his book, and that Fire &amp; Blood was published in Westeros after Yandel had found enough material.

But once I got to page 31, I found this:

""... the account of Aegon's Conquest is not my own work but something lately shared with me in the Citadel, **an as-yet complete work** by the Archmaester Gyldayn. This fragment -- part of a greater work that **is intended** as a history of the Targaryen kings -- was first brought to my attention by the Archmaester Perestan, who regards his efforts (and his prose) highly. The learned archmaester is most hesitant to share more **until his labors are concluded**, but has permitted (**after some persuasion**, I will admit) the use of certain passages in mine own, more modest effort. ...

""... I have placed it here, **with Gyldayn's blessing** ...""

This reads as if Gyldayn is still alive and working on what would become Fire &amp; Blood. I know that Fire &amp; Blood is intended to be a complete history of the Targaryen dynasty, and that GRRM wants to write it all as Gyldayn. So for those wondering when Gyldayn was writing, the answer seems to be 300 AC.

That is all well and fine. BUT. This is what follows the above text:

""There are other manuscripts by this same hand that **I have discovered**, but many pages have been misplaced or destroyed, and still others have been damaged by neglect and by fire. It may be that one day, **more will be found**, and **this lost masterwork** will be fit to be copied and bound ...""

Wow. That seems to me a pretty severe oversight on the editors' part.

What's more, no one seems to have noticed this; I have searched everywhere online for anything pertaining to when a new edition was published and have found nothing. 

I am quite frankly shocked that no one else has noticed this. As further evidence of the newness of this update, when I searched for Gyldayn online, I found that the WoIaF implies that he died during the Tragedy at Summerhall. But this seems to have been erased from the account of Aegon V's reign. On page 110, there is a fragment of a letter written by Summerhall's maester, Corso. I assume this letter fragment was originally written by Gyldayn. But again, there is no reference anywhere online -- not this subreddit, not the official wiki, nor any forums -- of any ""Maester Corso.""

So, ultimately, my question is ... when exactly did they publish this new edition???",asoiaf,[Spoilers MAIN] When did they update The World of Ice &amp; Fire?

85,"Gonna say it: Sandor killing Mycah makes absolutely no sense from a character perspective. 

A theory I've seen bandied around a lot is ""Sandor mercy-killed Mycah to save him from Joffrey""; the fact people have come up with this kinda proves my point that it doesn't fit with what we know of the Hound. It's pretty easily disproved because Sandor could have easily brought Mycah back alive, at which point Robert would have almost certainly shrugged and let the boy go free. 

For the most part, Sandor Clegane is a dick, but his killing of Mycah is an act so needlessly cruel it doesn't fit with his character at all. Indeed, his flaw isn't cruelty, it's apathy. He knows knighthood is a hypocritical sham, but rather than attempt to reform it or to improve himself, he just resignedly gives up and follows Joffrey's orders. Him trying to convince Sansa that romanticization is a lie is double-edged, because he both wants to protect her, but at the same time he wants validation for his beliefs. Sansa remaining true to her values must have made Sandor question his own apathy; even a twelve-year-old shows more moral courage than he does, and I'm sure that inspires him to ultimately leave King's Landing and abandon Joffrey. 

He's actually a really well-written character with a lot of depth. 

And it's all ruined because the very first thing he does of note is casually murdering a child. It makes him far too unsympathetic from the get go and isn't consistent with his later characterization. 

If he'd killed Lady or scared off Nymeria it would have caused the same animosity between him and Arya AND it would have a more tightly-knit plot. Mycah exists solely for Sandor to kill and has pretty much zero characterization or depth; he's a transparent ""superhero's parent"" who only exists to die so the main character can have a revenge quest. We can also apply the ""mercy-killing Mycah"" theory to him scaring off Nymeria to save her and it actually makes sense. 

(and I know I've argued this point a lot, but Gregor is a real waste of a character. He should have been some eloquent and gallant Gaston-esque figure who at least gives the pretense of not being pure unadulterated evil to contrast with Sandor. He's the personification of knighthood, but his behavior is so far removed from pretty much every other knight in the series the thematic contrast between him and Sandor doesn't work at all.)",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Sandor's First Killing Makes no Sense

93,"In Clash of Kings when Theon first arrives at Pyke and doesn’t see Euron’s ship he seems very relieved. In Storm of Swords Robb says something along the lines of “Euron would be a terrible king, if half of what Theon told him was true.”
We know why his brothers hate/fear Euron so much, but why would Theon? The last time he saw his uncle he was 10 years old. He isn’t outright terrified of him like Aeron is, and he doesn’t despise him like Victarion, but he clearly isn’t fond of him. 
I know George probably didn’t put that much thought into it, and those lines were just added to build up the Crow’s Eyes reputation in the reader’s mind before he shows up, but it still makes me curious. What kind of interactions did Theon have with his uncle that leave him with such a negative impression? Even more so because they say Euron often went reaving, it’s not like he was constantly spending time with his family. What could a 10 year old Theon see or hear (and understand) that would disturb him so much? Especially in the context of the Iron Islands, where it is the norm to be a violent rapist.
Like a lot of fans, I’m really fascinated by the Crow’s Eye, but even more than his plans for the future I’m really curious about what he was like before his exile. 
Aeron has hated him since he was a boy, of course, but clearly no one else in the family knew about his molestation. 
Asha mentions that Balon often argued with Euron about his affinity for freaks. (Must’ve been pretty public fights)
With Victarion, it seems to me that his hatred only stems from the death of his wife. At least the way I read his thoughts it seems his relationship with Euron wasn’t really all that bad before that. Maybe it was, but he doesn’t think about it, he always thinks of Euron in the context of his wife’s death. 
And with his dad? There isn’t a lot of info on Quellon but seeing how his sons turned out I wonder what kind of man he was, and what his relationship with his sons was like. They all mention being of Quellon’s loins several times, and quite proudly, so I imagine they have great respect for him. Do you think he ever knew or suspected his son was such a cruel and sadistic monster? If Euron was abusing and killing his brothers I’d imagine he probably also was an asshole to them on a daily basis. He’s been a sadistic bitch since he was a kid, it’s unbelievable his father wouldn’t notice or do something about it. 
I know the answers to these questions can only be conjecture because there just isn’t enough information in the books to answer them, but I’m curious what y’all think.

94,"I think it's a common and believable theory that Ser Patrek of King's Mountain wasn't killed by Wun Wun

Bowen Marsh and the conspirators seemed to have everything planned out and I can't imagine they were waiting to hatch it on the off chance Ser Patrek decided to steal Val that night

The body Wun Wun was holding was only recognisable by the heraldry

&gt; The dead man was Ser Patrek of King’s Mountain; his head was largely gone, but his heraldry was
as distinctive as his face

*

&gt; The knight’s cloak flapped in the cold air. Of white wool it had been, bordered in cloth-of-silver and patterned with blue stars

The NW seem to have some sewing skills as shown by them making a cloak for Alys Karstark and  Sigorns wedding (again white wool) 

&gt; Jon told the stewards to improvise. He thought they had done well. The bride’s cloak Sigorn fastened about Lady Alys’s shoulders showed a bronze disk on a field of white wool, surrounded by flames made with wisps of crimson silk.

So the body could just as easily be someone dressed up as Ser Patrek as the man himself, but if it wasn't Ser Patrek who was it?

I know people speculate it was one of the Wildlings bodies brought back and put in the ice cells; would their blood still ""spray""? if they were frozen for a long time and then thawed 

&gt; Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun howled again and gave Ser Patrek’s other arm a twist and pull. It tore
loose from his shoulder with a spray of bright red blood. 

If it was just a dead body, who did Jon hear scream?

&gt;  Then he heard the shouting … and a roar so loud it seemed to shake the Wall. “That come from Hardin’s Tower, m’lord,” Horse reported. He might have said more, but **the scream cut him off**. Val, was Jon’s first thought. But that was no woman’s scream. **That is a man in mortal agony.**

The scream could have been from one of the NW attackers who slashed Wun Wun 

&gt;  The giant was bleeding himself, with sword cuts on his belly and his arm.

But if it was a mortal wound, would the NW have had time to carry the person injured away before Jon ran there? maybe, or perhaps it was the person Wun Wun was holding

The NW don't like Cregen Karstark 

&gt; Cregan Karstark had taken to howling in the night of late, and throwing frozen feces at whoever came to feed him. That had not made him beloved of his guards

Likely they wouldn't have had any qualms about using him for this plot

Cregan does tell Jon 

&gt; Stark and Karstark are one blood

So maybe they were both bleeding that night?

I appreciate I don't have much foreshadowing or evidence here 

I guess I don't know what purpose Cregan serves at the Wall for the story? it does take him out of the way so he isn't at Karhold anymore, but GRRM could just as easily written him out before getting to the Wall, dying whilst resitting being taken prisoner by Jon and his men for instance

98,"Hello,

I noticed something about AA and his sword story yesterday. 

You all know the story of AA's sword. Legends are half true half story. They are also generally open to symbolic interpretation. I want to do this today.

Lightbringer is called a weapon and sword, both in the first and expected in the second AA. Of course, since we were looking for a real sword, the interpretations went over this and we expected a story of Nissa and sword making.

There are many predictions about who AA might be, and the biggest candidate (who seems to meet the requirements) is Dany. The problem was that Dany is not a warrior, she does not carry a sword and does not know how to use it even if she does. This part did not fit at all.

Also, if she has such a special sword, who should she fight and kill? Whom did the first AA fight and killed whom? The Others never died, and they always existed. We know that they wander around from time to time, even after the Long Night. (Night's King and his queen) According to the Essos story, it is the first AA to end the Long Night, but AA does not even have a name in the Westeros story. First Men defeated the Others. It is obvious that there is something strange in these stories. In summary, whatever happened in the past, nobody has been successful. It was not fully successful. Winter is coming...

There is no ""dragon"" in the AA legend, there is only in the prophecy, which is also very interesting in itself. Why? When we look at the legend of the first AA, nothing that mention about the dragon is visible, but for some reason, the prophecy is mentioned it. The prophecy emerges that ""AA will to wake dragons out of stone"".

What kind of ""common"" point exists between the first AA and the second AA, which is about dragons, there is something  about""stone dragon wake""?

There is nothing in common in sight. Is it? What if LB was a dragon from the very beginning?  What if the first AA's sword story is actually the story of hatching the dragon eggs?

You know that there is a sword and dragon metaphor in the books.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  ""The **Red** **Sword**,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a **sword**, the blade **still red-hot from the forge.**  
&gt;  
&gt; Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. ""**Dragons**,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be **dragons**, boy,"" she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.  
&gt;  
&gt; When your **dragons** were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a **flaming** **sword** above the world.""  

The first quote; ""comet; looks like red sword, still red-hot from the forge. ”

The second quote is ""Dragons are coming ...""

The third quote; ""Your dragons are a flaming sword above the world ...""

Very clear, i guess... **still red-hot from the forge...**

Dany warmed her eggs in the stove, but it did not work, then three dragons were born (with fire and blood magic) under the red omen that looked like a red sword, which was considered a dragon sign. Drogo was a king, her son was carrying king blood and Mirri.

Let's look first AA. 

 

&gt;"" It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights **Azor** **Ahai** labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder. Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do. A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.""

Is it possible to destroy the creatures of the Long Night with a sword? No. A dragon? Oh, it's definitely more useful.

If we interpret symbolically… Now, like Dany, he may have tried to hatch eggs in a temple with a sacred fire… Maybe we can accept this as an attempt to use fire magic directly? However, when it does not work in this way, he may have understood that he should use another additional force beside the fire. I'll will be a bit of a push, I agree, but it may have used ""water"" magic (Nymeria's people use magic of water). Using fire + water magic… but it cannot be successful, for obvious reasons. Later, he may have thought that this work would be more effective not with the magic of water, but with the magic of ""blood,"" and he used the blood of a lion, but when it didn't work, he decided that a stronger blood would be needed ... like king blood ... we don't know who Nissa's family is, but a real lion or someone symbolized by the lion (Bloodstone's wife was a tiger-woman. In this case, there might also be a lion-woman / man) doesn't work.. We can imagine that she has king blood, Nissa; her blood has to be special so that the magic works. There is a fire + blood spell and eventually the egg hatchs and the dragon is born.

In this way, we can explain what the belief of “there is power in the blood of the king…” and also learns the beginning of the “fire-blood spells”; We also learn why the spells in the east are in the weight of fire + blood (which Valyria is at the top of this. I believe that the people who founders here come from Dawn, you know, there is a possibility that there may be someone from the blood of AA-BloodStone.).

AA has accomplished the sword issue in half a year. If the long night is true, it took a generation or something. More than enough time for the dragon to wait for it to grow. Educating him, trying to control etc. One possibility is that they have forged the first dragon steels with this dragon, or are being forged before, I don't know anymore, I wrote a lot of scripts in this part.

According to Aemon's book, the sword is a red sword that radiates heat when not in use, but it burns when it is used. I don't know how a flaming sword used it without hurting… Does AA have immunity to fire? I think he is the ancestor of Targ.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/euovm0/danys\_dream\_fire\_and\_blood\_spoiler\_main/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/euovm0/danys_dream_fire_and_blood_spoiler_main/) 

This description actually reminded me of a dragon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; … and folded. The dragon gave one last hiss and stretched out flat upon his belly. Black blood was flowing from the wound where the spear had pierced him, smoking where it dripped onto the scorched sands. He is **fire** **made** **flesh**, she thought, and so am I.   
&gt;  
&gt; Daenerys Targaryen vaulted onto the dragon's back, seized the spear, and ripped it out. The point was half-melted, the iron red-hot, glowing.    
&gt;  
&gt; Dany could feel the heat of him between her thighs 

Dragons constantly emit heat because they are fire made flesh. We saw that his wound bleed and when his blood fell, smoking where it dripped.  Even the tip of the spear stuck was melted. This dragon will only emit heat unless he is used, but he will became fire when he starts to be used and will ash everything. This is what they are.

The redness of the sword is probably a sign of the dragon's color, all of which are in different colors, even the flames in different colors.

Do you think this can happen? Was it actually an effort to hatch the dragon egg that we read as a sword?

Thank you for read.",asoiaf,Symbolic Interpretation of the Azor Ahai Story (Spoiler Main)
99,"I am doing an audiobook read for first time. I intend on posting anytime something significant jumps out at me. In my previous post I discuseed how Benjen seemed to be manipulating Jon and his recruitment to the Nights watch. Carrying on from this I would like to discuss a potential dropped plot line from George... I am aware that Lysa Tully admits to sending the message in A storm of swords, however it seems evident that George planned Catelyn to be a bigger player in his original outline.

Catlyn II. The chapter begins with Catelyn thinking of her room in winterfell, of how the hot springs run through and under the walls and provide heat for her bedchamber. She thinks of how she likes a hot bath and even thinks of days in the sun with her sister and her brother...Then we realise this is a sex scene.

""The warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned 
could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she 
would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong 
place. So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a 
thousand times before."" Catelyn II A Game of thrones.

She thinks of everything but her husband, during a time when they are supposed to be most intimate. This is a first taste of the unconventional nature (In modern terms) of the relationship Lady Stark has with her husband

Quickly the conversation moves to Robert's offer of Handship. Catelyn believes she has to ""make Ned see"" the danger he will put them in if he refuses this offer. She muses on the thought of danger yet in the very next sentence she thinks of the offer itself

""He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. 
Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with 
that?”"" Catelyn II A Game Of Thrones

Her concern seems to not be about the danger of a refusal but rather the missed opprotunity for power if Ned refuses.

Catlyn then decides to bring up something hurtful in order to convince her husband. In response to Ned's protests that Sansa is too young for betrothal. Catelyn reminds him not only of her previous betrothal to his brother Brandon but naturally this reminder will invoke the memory of the brutal death of his brother also. Even mentioning this shows lengths Catelyn is willing to go to achieve her goals.

""She finished for him. “ . . . crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only 
twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.” Catelyn II A Game Of Thrones.

This obviously achieves the intended reaction and Ned is angered and hurt. Then the knock comes at the door. And in enters Maester Luwin. Note that orders were given that they were not disturbed, but Luwin holds that this message is too important to wait.

Catelyn's immediate thought is ""Perhaps we should close the window"" possibly alluding to her knowing what the maester has to say and that it should not be privy for other ears.

The Maester describes a message that has been left for him. He and his servants conveinantly did not see anyone enter his quarters to leave this message, however the maester without any evidence of basis immedietly suggests that it must have come from someone within the kings party

""My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king’s party. We have had no other visitors from the south.” Maester Luwin. Catelyn II A Game of Thrones.

The Maester describes that the message came in the form of a wooden box, and that the box contained a fine myrish lens. Ned being a normal human is confused by this and doesnt know what relevance a lens has to him. Catelyn on the other hand immedietly and without precedent remarks that ""A lens is an instrument to help us see"" This is extremely philosophical. Imagine in modern terms, recieving an envelope with reading glasses in it. Would your immediate thought be ""Glasses are objects to help us see"" A normal person would be confused by such a message. But Catelyn's immediate scripted statement, suggests that this was pre-planned.

Luwin then describes how he then dismantled the box for some reason and found the real message hidden within. Now ask yourself this. If someone was trying to leave an important message to you, would they really rely on such cryptic and improbable means to safe gaurd your message? If Luwin had just taken the lens as a gift and decided not to dismantle the box for no reason, would this message ever see the light of day? The convoluted nature of this message, clearly suggests some sort of deception.

The message is addressed to lady Catelyn and when Luwin approaches her. Catelyn is lost for words

""Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak"" Catleyn II A Game Of Thrones.

Not TRUSTING her self to speak. Possibly incase her lips betray her deception and her husband is able to see her deceit.

This is where everything gets weird. Before even reading the message Catelyn dramatically declares “There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel it.” She reads the letter and announces that Lysa had written it in a secret language that only her and Cat understand. Then she bizarrely jumps out of bed naked, which even shocks Ned and burns the letter in front of him and Luwin. Why would Catelyn need to burn a letter that is written in a language only her and Lysa can understand? Why is it burned so hastily? The answer is to stop Ned from reading it and seeing that something is not right.

When Ned rightly becomes distraght with worry and grabs her and asks her what the message said. Catelyn again speaks like someone who isnt human and philosophically states that  “A warning,” she said softly. “If we have the wits to hear.”

She describes that this perfect timed message (that arrived just as Ned was wrestling with the idea of going to Kingslanding and no one else has read) says that the Lannisters killed Ned's adoptive father. Then Catelyn says “Now we truly have no choice. You must be Robert’s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.” Her plan is truly coming together.

Then Luwin pipes in. It becomes very clear that both Luwin and Catelyn want to convince Ned to accept the kings offer. But what is the reason for this? Why is Luwin, convincing the lord of winterfell that his best course of action is to leave winterfell. What is he getting out if this. .

 “The Hand of the King has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn’s death, to bring his killers to the king’s justice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.” Luwin, Catelyn II A Game of Thrones.

They both pursue this goal together until Ned is looking about the room helplessly. And Catlyn again has peculiar thoughts. 

""Catelyn’s heart went out to him, but she 
knew she could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her 
children’s sake"" Catelyn II A Game of Thrones.

What victory? Her whole argument up to this point was to find the killer of John Arryn and to protect Robert. And she reinstates this point in her very next sentence “You say you love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother 
surrounded by Lannisters?” How is this a victory for her children? There are two things that would be a victory for her children Number one is Sansa becoming Queen of the seven kingdoms solidifying her power, the other concerns a certain bastard, which I will get to in a minute.

This is the point in which Catelyn's plan backfires. Ned has acccepted that he must go south.

“Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell.”
His words were like an icy draft through her heart. “No,” she said, suddenly afraid. Was 
this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her? Catelyn II A Game Of Thrones

Was this her punishment? Punishment for what exactly. If she has acted dutifully and truthfull why would she be punished?

Ned then conditions that he must take the children south, to Catelyn's dismay. Which leads the conversation back to the ""Victory that must be won for her children"" Number two Jon Snow.

Catelyn declares that Jon cannot stay in winterfell and Ned cannot compel her to take him as he is not her son. Then the maester comes up with a fantastic solution 

“Your brother Benjen came to 
me about Jon a few days ago. It seems the boy aspires to take the black.” Luwin. Catelyn II A Game of Thrones

Catelyn finally has the opportunity to secure a second victory for her children and get rid of the problem that has plagued her for 14 years.

""His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father 
no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn’s own grandchildren for Winterfell.
Catelyn II A Game of Thrones.

One hanging thread here is why would Luwin betray his Lord and work against his interests in favour of his lady wife? The answer is staring at us in plain text. “Maester Luwin has delivered all five of my children,” Catelyn said. Robb Stark was born in Riverun. If Luwin delivered all five children. He is the maester who came with Catelyn from her old home land and loyal to the Tullys

Catelyn has secured this victory for her children. But at what cost.

This was obviously changed in a storm of swords when Lysa is revealed to have sent the letter, but I think the evidence is there to suggest that GRRM planted these seeds and they just didnt grow.

TL;DR  George Martin originally intended : The letter concerning John Arryns death was sent by Catelyn and Maester Luwin to manipulate Ned in to accepting the position of hand of the king. Securing powrr for the starks through his handship, Sansa's marriage to Joffery and Jon Snow's exile to the wall.",asoiaf,Catelyn and Luwin's grand scheme (Spoilers Main)

**Savage giant** being Littlefinger (With the Titan of Braavos as his sigil) and **Castle built of snow** being Winterfell which Sansa literally builds out of snow in the final chapter of ASOS.

&gt;*The Titan of Braavos. Old Nan had told them stories of the Titan back in Winterfell. **He was a giant as tall as a mountain**, and whenever Braavos stood in danger he would **wake with fire in his eyes, his rocky limbs grinding and groaning as he waded out into the sea to smash the enemies**. ""The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,"" Nan would end, and **Sansa would give a stupid squeak**.*

¤ Arya reminisces this specifically while onboard a ship called the *Titan's daughter* (Alayne)

&gt;*“The great castle of the north.”*

&gt;*“It’s not so great.” The boy knelt before the gatehouse. “Look, here comes a giant to knock it down.”* 

&gt;*He stood his doll in the snow and moved it jerkily. “Tromp tromp I’m a giant, I’m a giant,” he chanted. “Ho ho ho, open your gates or I’ll mash them and smash them.” Swinging the doll by the legs, he knocked the top off one gatehouse tower and then the other.*

¤ Sansa couldn't bear to see the giant tromp all over Winterfell and *kills* it

&gt;*Lord Robert’s mouth trembled. “You killlllllllled him,” he wailed*

&gt;*“His lordship was destroying the castle,” said Petyr.*

&gt;**“A giant,”** the boy whispered, weeping. “It wasn’t me, it was **a giant hurt the castle**.

102,"In the past, I reviewed who had the [most fabulous helm](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9oc8u1/spoilers_extended_most_badass_helmet) and also some pretty [neat crowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9qgmca/spoilers_extended_aesthetics_of_ice_and_fire) in asoiaf.

Continuing with the head gear motif, today we will look at masks, who wears them, and some interesting things surrounding them.

I will be ignoring instances of the word mask in which George has described a character as masking their feelings. For this, I want to focus on the specific physical masks and their traditions on why they wear them.

#**Quaithe/Asshai**

I begin with Quaithe because I'm probably in good company that when we think of a mask, this person is the first thing to pop into our heads.

We don't know much about her except that she wears a red, lacquered mask in the tradition of the people of Asshai.

&gt;Those who walk the streets of Asshai are masked and veiled, and have a furtive air about them. Oft as not, they walk alone, or ride in palanquins of ebony and iron, hidden behind dark curtains and borne through the dark streets upon the backs of slaves.

The reason they wear masks is not stated, but there are some theories out there. Phrases like this illicit any number of wild theories about the Asshai.

&gt;The dark city by the Shadow is a city steeped in sorcery. Warlocks, wizards, alchemists, moonsingers, red priests, black alchemists, necromancers, aeromancers, pyromancers, bloodmages, torturers, inquisitors, poisoners, godswives, night-walkers, shapechangers, worshippers of the Black Goat and the Pale Child and the Lion of Night, all find welcome in Asshai-by-the-Shadow, where nothing is forbidden. Here they are free to practice their spells without restraint or censure, conduct their obscene rites, and fornicate with demons if that is their desire.

Due to their affinity for all things magic, some speculate that the Asshai have been a city of the undead for a long time, as there are no children. This would mean that if you remain an undead corpse for a long period of time, that mayhaps your face isn't in the best condition and they hide it behind masks.

&gt;Most sinister of all the sorcerers of Asshai are the shadowbinders, whose lacquered masks hide their faces from the eyes of gods and men. They alone dare to go upriver past the walls of Asshai, into the heart of darkness.

Quaithe has been theorized to be Shiera Seastar, Joanna Lannister and Ashara Dayne. Whomever she is, she may have use of a Glass Candle, as she visits Dany multiple times while not actually being in the same room. Along with that, she touches Dany and leaves a tingly sensation on her wrist for a moment, a one off, magic situation in our series. 

#**Archmaesters**

&gt;Archmaesters are maesters who have demonstrated mastery of a particular subject. They receive a mask, ring, and rod in the metal corresponding to the link of the maester's chain which signifies their expertise on the topic. Archmaesters teach the students at the Citadel in their subject of expertise, and they judge whether a novice or an acolyte has shown enough knowledge on their subject to receive a link for their chain.

&gt;Archmaesters have the right to sit on the Conclave, a council which elects the Grand Maester and determines when the seasons change. The meetings of the Conclave are conducted behind closed doors at the Citadel.

&gt;Each archmaester is said to carry a heavy, black iron key that will open most of the doors in the Citadel. They keep them close on their person, or hide them well.

The mask and their cute accessories signifies the Maester is an expert in a particular field of study, then they can judge acolytes on their progress and if they are capable to receive a link in their chain.

The known Archmaesters and their mask, ring, and rods:

&gt;Archmaester Ebrose, the healer, whose ring and rod and mask are silver

&gt;Archmaester Marwyn, called ""Marwyn the Mage"", whose ring and rod and mask are Valyrian steel

&gt;Archmaester Norren, the previous Seneschal, whose ring and rod and mask are electrum

&gt;Archmaester Perestan, the historian, whose ring and rod and mask are copper

&gt;Archmaester Ryam, whose ring and rod and mask are yellow gold

&gt;Archmaester Theobald, current Seneschal, whose ring and rod and mask are lead

&gt;Archmaester Vaellyn, called ""Vinegar Vaellyn"", the stargazer, whose ring and rod and mask are bronze

&gt;Archmaester Walgrave, an old man of uncertain wit, whose ring and rod and mask are black iron

#**Brazen Beasts**

&gt;Skahaz mo Kandaq had given her the new watch she had asked for, made up in equal numbers of freedmen and shavepate Meereenese. They walked the streets both day and night, in dark hoods and brazen masks. The Sons of the Harpy had promised grisly death to any traitor who dared serve the dragon queen, and to their kith and kin as well, so the Shavepate’s men went about as jackals, owls, and other beasts, keeping their true faces hidden.

At Dany's behest, the Brazen Beasts act as the City Watch of Meereen. Under the watchful eye of Skahaz mo Kandaq, she uses them to hunt down the Sons of the Harpy, and keep peace in Meereen, while the masks provide anonymous protection for the wearer. 

Mayhaps taking a page from the Unsullied, they choose a different mask each day, or at least they have the opportunity to, all to Barristan's dismay. 

&gt;“A mask can hide many things, Your Grace. Is the man behind the owl mask the same owl who guarded you yesterday and the day before? How can we know?”

Aside from the logistical problems of having possibly a different guard by your side every day, this also opens up the door for easy subterfuge, as we see later with Quentyn and club during the Dragon heist, and then again with Barristan working with Skahaz to capture Hizdar.

#**Braavos**

&gt;...Uthero had sent envoys from the Iron Bank to Valyria several years prior, to clear the way for what became known as the Uncloaking or the Unmasking of Uthero...

&gt;The anniversary of the Uncloaking is celebrated every year in Braavos with ten days of feasting and masked revelry—a festival like none other in all the known world, culminating at midnight on the tenth day, when the Titan roars and tens of thousands of revelers and celebrants remove their masks as one.

So here we have a very obvious connection with Braavos and the Faceless Men and *masks*. The FM quite literally wear someone else's face like a mask. This, a direct result of former slaves leaving Valyria. The founders of Braavos were most likely the same people who created the FM organization, or were influential enough that people started wearing *actual* masks in veneration of the city.

#**Misc**

- Morna White Mask seems to be a hermaphrodite witch that wears a Weirwood mask. Jon Snow, in all his glory, put her in charge of Queensgate. My head canon is that she is from Asshai, due to numerous other clues about Asshai culture north of the Wall. Tinfoil, she trained at the Citadel and chose a Weirwood mask(no mention of a ring or rod) for her expertise. 

- Khal Drogo and free Dothraki are described
 as such numerous times:

&gt;Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask...

&gt;A crowd had gathered to stare at Dany with hard black eyes, their faces like masks of beaten copper.

I'm not sure, but it occurs enough to notice it, and then Dany has her Brazen Beasts, men who wear bronze masks.

- Like what the FM do, using a glamour is a way of wearing a *mask* of another person.

- Weirwood trees have faces carved in them, as if they are wearing masks.

- Lastly, Mystery Knights conceal their identities using a helm that covers the face.

Tinfoil: With the exception of maybe the Brazen Beasts, the mask traditions of Planetos stem from the same source. Possibly Asshai, then the Valyrians copied it, which led to the creation of the Faceless Men.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) A Song of Aesthetics and Fire: Masks

109,"&gt;""Who's this one now?"" Craster said before Jon could go. ""**He has the look of a Stark**.""  *Jon III, ACOK*

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time, this line (my bolding) has confused as well as intrigued the reader. It has led many of us to think that Craster knows how a Stark looks.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it does not make any sense at all. Because Craster has never met any other Stark except for Benjen (as far as we know and as far as the author has indicated otherwise). And Benjen does not look like the Ned or Jon at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night's Watch.   *Jon I, AGOT*

&amp;#x200B;

If Benjen looked anything like them at all, GRRM would have bothered to mention it. It is also not a big deal to believe that Benjen wouldn't look like Lyanna or the Ned, considering that Brandon also looked different.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, we need to find out how Craster could figure out that Jon looks like a Stark.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jarman Buckwell's scouts were tightening the girths on their saddles before setting out. ""Jon,"" Buckwell greeted him from horseback. ""**Keep a good edge on that bastard sword of yours.** We'll be needing it soon enough.""   *Jon III, ACOK*

&amp;#x200B;

In the very same chapter, Jarman Buckwell (who is in charge of the scouts) calls out to Jon and tells him to keep a good edge on Longclaw. We will later learn that it's because the NW would be soon fighting Mance Rayder.

&amp;#x200B;

On the surface, this seems quite normal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Craster's hall was dim after daylight. Inside, the night's torches had burned low, and it was hard to know that the sun had risen. **Lord Mormont's raven was the first to spy him enter.** Three lazy flaps of its great black wings, and **it perched atop Longclaw's hilt**. ""Corn?"" It nipped at a strand of Jon's hair.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few lines later, Mormont's Raven flies to Jon and perches on Longclaw's hilt. Now, *this* is weird.

&amp;#x200B;

In a span of 10 lines, there is a very subtle focus on Longclaw. If it was just Jarman, I wouldn't have cared but the involvement of Mormont's Raven does make you wonder. It certainly made me wonder.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock, shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, **then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap.** A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush, his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell.    *Jon III, ACOK*

&amp;#x200B;

This is the only instance in the entire series where we see the shoulder strap for Longclaw mentioned. And that's when it hit on me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Old Bear seemed pleased by that. ""I suppose they do. **You'll want to wear that over the shoulder**, I imagine. It's too long for the hip, at least until you've put on a few inches. And you'll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well. Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.""    *Jon VIII, AGOT*

&amp;#x200B;

Jon does not wear Longclaw by the hip. As Jeor puts it, Jon is still a little short and needs to gain a few inches as the sword is too long.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;His right hand opened and closed, and **he reached down for Longclaw and slung the bastard sword over a shoulder** before he wheeled to trot back to where the Lord of Bones and his band were waiting.  *Jon II, ASOS*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There was no time to think or plan or shout for help. Jon dropped his bow, **reached back over his shoulder, ripped Longclaw from its sheath**, and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower.  *Jon VII, ASOS*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**He reached back over his shoulder and drew Longclaw** just as a thin line of rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away.   *Jon X, ASOS*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ser Alliser Thorne reached for his sword hilt. Go on, Jon thought. **Longclaw was slung across his back**. Show your steel. Give me cause to do the same.    *Jon II, ADWD*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jon Snow **reached back and pulled Longclaw** from his sheath.    *Jon VII, ADWD*

&amp;#x200B;

Due to this, Jon wears the sword on his back for the entire series. Even in ADWD, he wears it like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. **The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder**. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone.

&amp;#x200B;

As can be seen from the example of Arthur Dayne, the hilt of his sword is largely visible over his shoulder, since he is wearing it on his back. Most hilts are not really that decorated but there is something about Longclaw's hilt that makes it stand out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. **It had been carved into the likeness of a** ***snarling wolf's head***, with chips of ***garnet set into the eyes***. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood.        *Jon VIII, AGOT*

&amp;#x200B;

The hilt of Longclaw has a pommel, which has been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf. And the wolf itself has garnets in its eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Craster did not observe that Jon had the ""look of a Stark"". He assumed that Jon was a Stark because he saw the pommel of Longclaw's hilt and recognised the sigil of the Starks.

&amp;#x200B;

GRRM repeats this when Jon meets the Weeper.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Weeper's red rheumy eyes gave Jon another look. ""Aye? Well, **he has a wolfish cast to him**, now as I look close. Bring him to Mance, might be he'll keep him."" He wheeled his horse around and galloped off, his riders hard behind him.    *Jon I, ASOS*

&amp;#x200B;

Jon does not actually have a ""wolfish cast"" to him. But he does have a very giant wolf walking beside him. The Weeper only comments on Jon's look when one of the spearwives mentions that he is a warg, citing Ghost who is walking along with Jon.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as Weeper comments on Jon's looks for a completely different reason, Craster does the same.",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Main) How Craster figured out the ""look of a Stark"""

Bear with me, momentarily, while I explain my hesitance to read it.

I'm not sure that it's written with someone like me in mind. I'd very much like to hear about the Targaryen histories, but preferably in a dramatized/novelized manner (something akin to Dunk and Egg, or asoiaf itself.) Before ordering it, I read a number of reviews that criticized it as 'dull' or 'boring', and poorly edited. Is this the case?

I've read asoiaf half a dozen or so times over the past decade and a half, and segued from here into reading most of his other work (Thousand Worlds, Fevre Dream, Armageddon Rag etc. etc.), and enjoying much of it (truthfully a mixed bag, but the same is true of all authors). I read through the World of Ice and Fire, and quite enjoyed it, though the manner in which it was written meant that it took me a good deal of time to get through it initially. I first read it cover to cover, and then later revisited specific sections for fact checking/point proving/out of general interest. The Targaryen history was (or so I thought) fairly thoroughly covered in this book, and I'm given to understand that much of this material has been recycled for F&amp;B. Is this correct? How much of F&amp;B is new material, and will it add much to my enjoyment/understanding of the series (re-contextualizing events I've previously read, for example)?  
What kind of a 'read' is it? Does it come across as a dry list of events that have happened, or is it enthralling/entertaining?

I'm also a little concerned that the second half (or 'part two) might not be released for a decade or so, as he stated that he'll finish Winds of Winter and write some more D&amp;E novellas beofre beginning to work on the next F&amp;B book.. Is it a satisfying read, in the sense that it has a recognizable 'beginning, middle, end' format(for example, if part two were never released, would you feel satisfied with what you had read in this book alone)?

Should I give Fire and Blood a read? Perhaps it's just 'not for me'. I may not be the target audience for this particular book, and I'm okay with that if it's the case. I can still consider myself a fan of the core series. So, yeah.. What do you think?

119,"I think I've touched on this subject before but I found a new piece of evidence so I figured I'd revisit this detail. In ACOK, when Bran is asking for various opinions on the meaning of the red comet, Old Nan claims that she can smell the comet, and that the odor means dragons.

&gt;Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire. ""It is the sword that slays the season,"" he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.

&gt;Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. **""Dragons,"" she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. ""It be dragons, boy,"" she insisted.** -Bran I, ACOK

Now, Old Nan may have superhuman senses (Old Nan = witcher confirmed), but she is obviously not smelling a comet in the vacuum of space. Or Daenerys's dragons thousands of miles away. But what is she smelling? I found the likely answer in ADWD.

&gt;Even the godswood was turning white. A film of ice had formed upon the pool beneath the heart tree, and the face carved into its pale trunk had grown a mustache of little icicles. At this hour they could not hope to have the old gods to themselves. Rowan pulled Theon away from the northmen praying before the tree, to a secluded spot back by the barracks wall, **beside a pool of warm mud that stank of rotten eggs.** -Theon I, ADWD

The smell of rotten eggs comes from hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas that can be smelled in incredibly minute quantities. The average human, with an olfactory capacity Old Nan would find pathetic, can smell it at a concentration of 0.47 parts per *billion.* And it is commonly found in volcanic gas, particularly low temperature volcanic gas associated with hydrothermal systems like Winterfell's hot springs.

The fact that GRRM draws attention to this gas and the fact that characters who have never noticed it before are smelling it is a clue that something is happening deep below Winterfell. One of several clues.

&gt;Snow was falling on the godswood too, melting when it touched the ground. Beneath the white-cloaked trees the earth had turned to mud. Tendrils of mist hung in the air like ghostly ribbons. -The Turncloak, ADWD

&gt;He had never seen the godswood like this, though—grey and ghostly, filled with warm mists and floating lights and whispered voices that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. -The Prince of Winterfell, ADWD

These lights are probably [will-o'-the-wisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will-o%27-the-wisp), which can also result from spontaneous ignition of natural gases.

In short, GRRM is warning us: the ""stone dragons"" are restless.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Why Old Nan can smell dragons.
122,"During a recent reread I noticed a particular statement that piqued my curiosity. 




&gt;The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King's Tower—so-called, though **no king had visited it for a hundred years**—and Lannister dined at Mormont's own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers. -AGOT, Jon III





From this quote we know that a hundred years prior to the events of the main series the wall was visited by a king. Initially this confused me, because there is no other mention of said king and his visit to the wall. I believe the lack of information on this subject is deliberate because it will serve as a plot point for a future Dunk and Egg novel. 





The most realistic possibility, as far as I am concerned, has to be Maekar, and in this post I will explain my reasoning.





The first question we have to ask is “Why would Maekar visit the wall?” I 
believe the answer to this lies with Raymun Redbeard’s attack on the night’s watch, and the subsequent war fought to push him back. We know that Raymun Redbeard invaded during the reign of Maekar, during the year 226 AC. 





The only information we have regarding the fight between a Raymun and the forces of the seven kingdoms state that the Stark’s and their bannermen were involved, but I believe this was done deliberately so as to keep the plot of a future D&amp;E novel unspoiled.  In addition, given what we know about Maekar, and his affinity for battle, I believe it is a fair to assume, with some degree of doubt, that he would not pass the opportunity to do battle against the King Beyond the Wall.



I believe it is also possible the above quote refers to Aegon V, who we know is likely to visit the wall prior to his becoming king, but I find this less likely as he was not a king at the time.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) “The King a Hundred Years ago”

124,"I’ve been thinking about ghosts in ASOIAF lately. 

It’s something that I’m surprised is not discussed more. Especially considering how often they come up throughout the series. 

There’s *plenty* of evidence that ghosts are real. From Arya hearing Syrio’s voice helping her escape the Red Keep as he is dying, to Qyburn (an authority on death) flat-out saying that they’re real. 

So I decided to strap on my proton-pack and do a reread starting with AKotSK. 

Unfortunately the story is so damn good that I was halfway through The Sworn Sword before I remembered what I was doing (a couple of glasses of Dornish Red, courtesy of u/Prof_Cecily, may have contributed) when suddenly the following happened. 

&gt; Dunk fumbled at his swordbelt. Have I lost the dagger too? he wondered. No, there it was. His hand closed around the hilt and he wrenched it free, and drove it slowly through the churning water, through the iron rings and boiled leather beneath the arm of Lucas the Longinch, turning it as he pushed. Ser Lucas jerked and twisted, and the strength left him. Dunk shoved away and floated. His chest was on fire. A fish flashed past his face, long and white and slender. What's that? he wondered. What's that? What's that?


At the *very moment* that Ser Lucas dies, Dunk sees something long, white, and slender go past him. Dunk takes it for a “fish”, a fair enough assumption. 

But my ecto-reader is beeping like crazy!!

Dunk describes Ser Lucas as “sinewy rather than muscular”, which to me gives the impression of a tall man who while not exactly lanky might, if seen without his armour, be described as “Slender”. 

“Long”,  goes without saying. 

And even Jon Snow knows that ghosts are “White”. 

Dunk saw Ser Lucas’ soul shuffle loose this mortal coil. QED.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Does Dunk see a ghost?
128,"Has anyone here tried to figure out how much time was ""stolen"" from TWoW by F&amp;B?

Given that the book was released in November 2018 and announced sometime in April, it's reasonable to imagine that George spent pretty much all of 2017 and 2018 working just on Fire and Blood.

We know that George posted in the beginning of 2016 that he hadn't made as much progress as he hoped with Winds, although he felt like he could get it done in the span of a few months. Indulge me here, but what if 2016 was one of his lowest points and he just didn't want to work on it anymore? He could've taken a nice long break and then accepted that it just wasn't working, and moved on to another project. Enter Fire and Blood.

With the ""high"" that he got from finishing a book, as well as the pressure lifting given the end of the TV show, I like to think that 2019 was basically the year that he seriously got back to writing Winds in almost 3 years. (In my heart of hearts, I even like to think he got a rough draft through to his editor towards the end of 2019 and he's polishing it up now, but we don't have to discuss that).

So anyway, even though the 9 year wait since Dance has been maddening, it makes me feel a little better to think that taking Fire and Blood into account, it's probably closer to a 6-7 year wait.

Knowing how much he wanted to control Westeros through magic BEFORE he even found the cave, I can’t imagine he wouldn’t have wanted to try and manipulate Aerys eventually, although the king’s descent into madness seems pretty legit and not suspicious. 

It’s possible that Aerys did have some prophetic ability though, he was terrified of blades and wouldn’t have one near him, even to shave- almost as if he had some sense that a blade would be his end.

And then he disappears beyond the wall searching for what happened to Waymar Royce and the men under his care which is the last we hear of him until Lord Commander Mormont goes on a search party for him after hearing no word of Benjen. 

I know George has said he isn't coldhands and I actually like the fact he is not and that the TV series gave the coldhands story to Benjen when I would have preferred the mystery of maybe he is still out there in hiding. Although this isn't characteristic for Benjen due to being a Stark I can't see him being dead in the books. I think with Brandon the Builder raising the wall and the magical abilities in House Starks blood I doubt the others would want to kill Benjen. I would like to hear about what happened to Benjen in retrospect to the children of the forest's story in that he was taken by the Others but saved by the Children of the Forest due to him being a Stark of Winterfell. 

I would like to think Benjen will never abandon the Nights Watch but help the children of the forest in the further north in trying to gain information on the Others to then take back to the North instead of going back to the Nights Watch. The reason's I would want this to happen is there are some things Benjen can confirm which are obviously related to Lyanna and Jon, I think if anyone should tell Jon the truth of who he is it should be Benjen.

134,"It seems to me that a lot of people don't understand House Frey, how it operates, what its motivations and prospects are. I am tired of all the outlandish ideas and theories on revenge against House Frey so here it goes...

&amp;#x200B;

Current patriarch of House Frey is lord Walder. He is 92 years old and is expected to die soon. Lord Walder has been stubbornly holding on to life because he is not blind to the fact of overpopulation of his House and the nature of many of his descendants.

His primary motivation is to give his House power and prosperity. However with the House getting broken into factions his dreams of having one unified mighty House have evaporated. Currently his primary concern is ensuring that his House survives his passing.

\^That is why he betrayed Robb Stark. He married his family with pretty much everyone of power, respect or value. He tried to make sure that every branch got a home and some reasonably bright future.

So lets look at these branches and see what Lord Walder managed to accomplish for them.

The most powerful Frey branch is Royce Freys (descendants from Perra Royce). Those are divided into 2 Swann braches (Edwyn's and Black Walder's) and Lannister (Emmon's) and Aenys'.

Ryman was supposed to get The Twins. With him dead Edwyn is the heir apparent.

Black Walder is reasonably likely to find himself a place as a household knight with pretty much any lord. (Assuming that he doesn't contest Edwyn for The Twins and try to get him killed, which he will).

Emmon Frey gets Riverrun.

Aenys had a reasonable chance of attaching himself to Bolton's household. However he is dead, his son Rhaegar is dead, Aegon is an outlaw. The others are too young, useful for making pacts and serving as hostages should Frey's be required to send some but otherwise screwed.

Perriane is married to Leslyn Haigh. Not all that amazing but a life of a wife of a minor lord is quite decent.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a second Swann branch that would ally itself with either of the higher Swann branches but they are extinguished in the male line (patriarch of the branch was Jared Frey who got cooked into a pie, his son Tytos slain by Sandor Clegane).

&amp;#x200B;

Then comes a Crakehall Branch.

Thanks to lord Walder's heroic efforts in marrying Merret to the lady Mariya Darry the Crakehall Branch will get the castle Darry. They are also quite likely to get their younger members to serve at Crakehall. Overall they should be fine. Sandor Frey is squire at Ironoaks and Raymund's numberous bunch will likely be welcome by the Beesbury.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is the Blackwood Branch.

The patriarch is Lame Lothar who is (arguably) the most dangerous of lord Walder's sons. He is clever, ambitious and devious. While he himself serves as steward at The Twins, has brothers married to the Paeges and a sister to a Brax I have a feeling that he will try to make a play for The Twins themselves. Should Edwyn and Black Walder kill each other (as well they might) Lame Lothar will easily be able to claim The Twins. Even if he doesn't dare claim it in his own name he can claim it in the name of one of the younger nephews and still rule the castle.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we have Rosby Freys.

They are the weakest of the major branches. They were largely unmarried. If Walder Frey died before the Red Wedding the Rosby Freys would be left beggin Lord Gyles for a roof over their head with no other options. As it is however Roslin is married to Edmure Tully and her child with get either a knighthood and some land (if he is a boy), get a good marriage and a large dowry (if she is a girl) OR become the heir to Riverrun (should the Tullies be reinstated as Lords Paramount of the Trident).

&amp;#x200B;

The Farring Branch is a bunch of kids. Their patriarch is a page at Seagard (so he is not even old enough to be a squire). Considering that Godry Farring is with Stannis they won't get anything (unless Stannis sits the Iron Throne).

&amp;#x200B;

And poor Joyeuse Erenford would do best to run back to her own father. Maybe she will be married to some landed knight if she is lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

So when Lord Walder dies Edwyn and Black Walder will go to war on one another. By law the lordship will pass to Edwyn but there will definitely be enough people who dislike him for one reason or another, there will be those who deem him weak and unfit to be a lord.

They will likely try to assassinate each other and (with some help from Lame Lothar) they are reasonably likely to BOTH succeed at it. After that the Frey Civil War goes from a two-sided affair that debated what qualities a lord should possess and who is better fit to be one into a more open debate.

Lame Lothar will seize The Twins themselves, while not nessesarily proclaiming himself The Lord of the Crossing, he will rule there and won't support any branch stronger than his own.

Crakehall Freys might decide to make a claim. They are well placed to do so, they will have support of Ser Lyle Crakehall, Ser Harwyn Plumm and maybe even some Royces and Beesburies.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall when they go to war on each other the Freys will pull half the realm in with them, especially if Emmon Frey decides to press his claim.

&gt; But Ashara's daughter had been stillborn, and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon after, mad with grief for the child she had lost, and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at Harrenhal as well. She died never knowing that Ser Barristan had loved her. How could she? He was a knight of the Kingsguard, sworn to celibacy. No good could have come from telling her his feelings. No good came from silence either. If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty, might she have looked to me instead of Stark? 

Hello,

This what Selmy think. According to him Ashara had a daughter by a Stark(Ned). In general, everyone believes that Ashara gave birth to a child but they assume this child is Jon but Selmy (some how) knows it's a girl, stillborn. 

They base this child issue on the Harrenhall tournament. (Ned-Ashara) Even Ned Dayne knows Ashara and Ned Stark have a love affair, his aunt told him, so I'm sure Dayne family knows what is right or not.

Many readers have produced theory on this subject and this is mine.

What if Ashara's daughter still alive and this is Ned Dayne's aunt Allyria Dayne? Mostly fans believe Ashara still alive for a reason, after all she did not kill herself until meet Ned. She knew Ned wed Cat Tully, she could kill herself after death of her child but chose after meet him? What ever.

There is no evidence that the child is not dead. But there is a comment of Grrm.

 

&gt;My readers should know better than to take anything as gospel, unless they see it for themselves, and even then I do sometimes use “unreliable narrator.” No. They should not take that as the truth. What about Mance Rayder, did you think he was really dead?

So, maybe she is still alive and this is Allyria. We do not know anything about the age and physical appearance of Allyria. We know she was only engaged to Beric. However, we may have an idea of her age.

 GRRM: [https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Age\_of\_Sexual\_Relations\_in\_Westeros](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Age_of_Sexual_Relations_in_Westeros) 

In Westeros, girls are usually married at the age of 15-16 or if they are getting married at an earlier age, they are waiting for the wedding night until this age.

Let's look what Ned said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""How long have you been Lord Beric's squire?"" she asked, to take his mind from his misery.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""He took me for his page when he espoused my aunt."" He coughed. ""I was seven, but when I turned ten he raised me to squire. I won a prize once, riding at rings."" 

Beric is not immediately married to Allyria. When Ned was 7 years old, the two were engaged, and when Ned was 10, they still engaged. Ned is 12 years old now (3th book). He has been engaged to her for at least 4-5 years. 

Then this girl's age must be at least 16-17 now. If Ashara's daughter is alive, she must be at this age.

If it's true, Ned has a bastard girl and is still alive.",asoiaf,Ashara Dayne's Daughter ( Spoiler Main)
137,""" Two kings to wake the dragon. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen's men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds.""

Jon Snow and Maester Aemon hear and discuss this in the context of being concerned for the life of Mance Rayder's child.

Of course, Mance Rayder isn't dead, and this prophecy, if it is such, has nothing to do with him.

The phrase wake the dragon, with minimal squinting, connects to AA and the phrase, ""to wake dragons from stone."" Of course we are going from singular to multiple dragons, and GRRM is not sloppy in his word choices. More on that later.

Most popular theories on who the two kings are, as far as I have seen.

Aegon/Duncan Targaryen at Summerhall. Assuming of course that Egg died before his son. 

This is wrong. Duncan explicitly abdicated the throne, so upon his father's death, he does not become king and die as king.

Rhaegar. Also, clearly wrong, he died a prince, before his father Aerys.

Drogo and Rhaego. Again, Rhaego dies first, never became a Khal. Even if you want to say that Drogo wasn't really alive, Rhaego still never became a Khal, he was too young to ride. Had he been born, the new Khal would have given him to the dogs. In any case, he was dead before he was born.

The 'prophecy,' it seems reasonable to conclude, implies a quick succession of deaths. Otherwise, any king and his son who inherited the throne normally would satisfy the prophecy. It would refer to any normal succession and therefore be meaningless. So let's throw out Robert/Joffrey (which has other problems) and Aerys/Viserys (also has other problems).

To me, this is a classic GRRM providing the answer before the riddle. (AA isn't even mentioned until book 2). Prophecy is not something to look for in the pages to come, but more frequently riddles describing events we have already been told about.

My theory on who the two kings are: Khal Ogo and his son, the brief Khal Fogo!

Fogo is literally only mentioned three times in ASOIAF, check out the passages:

 ""A few cuts,"" Ser Jorah answered, ""nothing of consequence. He slew two khals this day. Khal Ogo first, and then the son, **Fogo**, **who became khal when Ogo fell**. His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair, and now Khal Drogo's every step rings louder than before."" 

 ""Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo,"" Khal Drogo said in the Common Tongue. ""I kill him for it, and Ogo too."" He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringing softly. ""Is Ogo you hear, and **Fogo** his khalakka, **who was khal when I slew him**."" 

Fogo is mentioned only three times ever, and two of those times go out of their way to tell the reader that he died after his father, and that as a consequence he died as a Khal. Seems like a ludicrous thing to emphasize for a character with a total of three mentions. I understand Drogo bragging about killing two Khals, but why would Jorah go out of his way to pass on this detail? He is following Dany, not Drogo. He seems more likely to mock the idea that killing them in a specific order matters (though he's not dumb enough to do this in front of Drogo). This elaboration seems almost out of character for Jorah, strangely forced into his dialogue just to emphasize the facts.

The biggest argument against this I see, is that a Khaleesi is not a Queen, as Dany says herself. On the other hand, she specifically equates prince to khalakka. Dany of course, speaks both languages and actively tries to adopt the culture. The random dying Westeros man would not have understood the difference, nor even have known the word 'Khal' in his vocabulary. He could have only have used the words of his language and vocabulary, of which King is the closest. 

The conflict with Ogo and Fogo directly lead to Drogo's wound that ultimately killed him leading to his pyre etc.

Frankly, I think it's a conflation to say that this has anything to do with AA, as the phrase wake the dragon is used repeatedly in Dany's storyline, and is therefore distinct from waking dragons (plural) from stone. She also did this of course, but I think the singular versus the plural have different meanings. I think the phrase wake the dragon, singular, refers only to what we know it refers to. The phrase is used repeatedly in Dany's story of becoming empowered in the first book. She becomes less afraid, and take more and more of a leadership role onto herself. For my money, wake the dragon means waken as a worthy Targaryen, which she has. 

TLDR: The prophecy refers to past events, summarzing Dany's formative experiences, and probably is distinct from the AA prophesy anyway.",asoiaf,(Spoiler Main) 2 kings die to wake the dragon

A Clash of Kings – Summer and The Winged Wolf – Chained

In this volume, while we continue our themes, we see how close Summer and Bran truly are through the introduction of wolf dreams.  Later, Bran gets his first mentor in Jojen, and we get even more information about how Bran’s power fits into this bond. Finally, Bran is isolated in the crypts, and we see a step change in Bran’s ability to truly warm into Summer. By the end of this book we’ll see how the magic indeed is stronger in Bran, which makes their bond develop stronger and faster.

Maester Luwin’s anti magic bias is continued rather heavy-handedly in this volume as well.  Coupled with the effect of Old Nan’s stories, Bran fears the obvious magical implications of his dreams.  The effect is to limit his receptivity to the message of the 3iCrow, Jojen, and the tree dreams.  Jojen calls him the winged wolf, but he is chained to Winterfell by this fear and reticence.

Unfortunately, the theme of the Direwolves not being able to protect the boys when separated from them continues in this volume, too.

The first Bran chapter in ACoK is the  first mention of a wolf dream in the story, although Old Nan tells Bran that he is not the first Stark to experience one.  She also echoes the SSM from our introduction.

This chapter is almost non-stop direwolf interaction and wolf dream hints. Bran is stuck in his room a lot and finds interest in the behavior of the wolves, especially howling.  This is an example of the call of the pack. He tries to get in the wolves heads, especially about why they’re howling at the comet, and he gets a lot of conflicting feedback from people around Winterfell.  One ironic comment is from Roderick Cassel, who asks “who can know the mind of a wolf?”  Oh, Ser Roderick, the answer was staring into your face!

&gt;**A Clash of Kings – Bran I**  
He could not walk, nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had, but he could still look. He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall, and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars.  
**Of late, he often dreamed of wolves**. They are talking to me, brother to brother, he told himself when the direwolves howled. He could almost understand them . . . not quite, not truly, but almost . . . as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten. The Walders might be scared of them, but the **Starks had wolf blood. Old Nan told him so**. “**Though it is stronger in some than in others**,” she warned.  
Summer’s howls were long and sad, full of grief and longing. Shaggydog’s were more savage. Their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack of direwolves haunted Winterfell, instead of only two . . . two where there had once been six. Do they miss their brothers and sisters too? Bran wondered. Are they calling to Grey Wind and Ghost, to Nymeria and Lady’s Shade? Do they want them to come home and be a pack together?  
“Who can know the mind of a wolf?” Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled. Bran’s lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence, and his duties left him little time for idle questions.  
“It’s freedom they’re calling for,” declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. “They don’t like being walled up, and who’s to blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle.”  
“They want to hunt,” agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew. “A wolf smells better’n any man. Like as not, they’ve caught the scent o’ prey.”  
Maester Luwin did not think so. “Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.”  
When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. “Your wolves have more wit than your maester,” the wildling woman said. “They know truths the grey man has forgotten.” The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, “Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.

The howling continues, making us all wonder what it’s like in the mind of a wolf. Bran, remembering his wolf dream and determined to find out, starts howling himself.  It’s a bit of humor at the beginning of this part of the saga, although it’s clear that this pack behavior is recognized by the wolves and represents a deepening of the bond.  Ominously, though, this is the first time that both wolves have been confined away from the boys since Bran awoke.  Did nobody tell Ser Roderick of the protection that Summer has provided their Lord?  Is his memory so short?

&gt;And **still the direwolves howled**. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders shivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights. Only Bran did not mind. **Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood** after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran’s window. Other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that he could see them.  
\[…\]  
Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his bed; Robb had told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father’s death, the wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the maester’s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls.  
**Who are they mourning now**? Had some enemy slain the King in the North, who used to be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother died, or one of his sisters? Or was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think?  
If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, he thought wistfully. **In his wolf dreams, he could race up the sides of mountains**, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used to be.  
It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he was Robb’s heir, and Robb was King in the North now. He turned his head to howl at the guard. “Oooooooo. Oo-oo-oooooooooooo.”  
“Oooo,” Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet. “Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo,” he howled. It sounded stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy’s howl, not a wolf’s. **Yet Summer gave answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran’s thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus.** Bran haroooed again. They howled together, last of their pack.  
The noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose. He peered in, saw Bran howling out the window, and said, “What’s this, my prince?”  
It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he was Robb’s heir, and Robb was King in the North now. He turned his head to howl at the guard. “Oooooooo. Oo-oo-oooooooooooo.”  
Hayhead screwed up his face. “Now you stop that there.”  
“Ooo-ooo-oooooo. Ooo-ooo-ooooooooooooooooo.”

Certainly, Maester Luwin knows better than confine the wolves away from the boys, but he can admit to to himself due to his prejudices against magic. That skepticism is in full force in the second half of the selections below.  Bran is dropping hints left and right about wolf dreams and trees dreams.  It’s clear that he’s being bombarded with information in these dreams and is trying to make sense of it.  He doesn’t even seem to realize that he is “dreaming” inside the consciousness of Summer.  He desperately misses the wolf, given the forced separation.  I wonder if the separation fostered a quicker development of the wolf dreams that might have otherwise happened.  Thinking back to part 3, the same didn’t happen immediately with Arya And Nymeria, although their connection seemed to be reignited when in closer proximity while still being separated in the Riverlands.

&gt;“All men must sleep, Bran. Even princes.”  
“**When I sleep I turn into a wolf**.” Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night. “Do wolves dream?”  
“All creatures dream, I think, yet not as men do.”  
“Do dead men dream?” Bran asked, thinking of his father. In the dark crypts below Winterfell, a stonemason was chiseling out his father’s likeness in granite.  
“Some say yes, some no,” the maester answered. “The dead themselves are silent on the matter.”  
**“Do trees dream?**”  
“Trees? No . . .”  
“They do,” Bran said with sudden certainty. “**They dream tree dreams. I dream of a tree sometimes**. A weirwood, like the one in the godswood. It calls to me. The wolf dreams are better. I smell things, and sometimes I can taste the blood.”  
\[…\]  
“Home. It’s their fault **you won’t let me have Summer**.”  
“The Frey boy did not ask to be attacked,” the maester said, “no more than I did.”  
“That was Shaggydog.” Rickon’s big black wolf was so wild he even frightened Bran at times. “Summer never bit anyone.”  
“**Summer ripped out a man’s throat in this very chamber, or have you forgotten**? The truth is, those sweet pups you and your brothers found in the snow have grown into dangerous beasts. The Frey boys are wise to be wary of them.”  
“We should put the Walders in the godswood. They could play lord of the crossing all they want, and Summer could sleep with me again. If I’m the prince, why won’t you heed me? I wanted to ride Dancer, but Alebelly wouldn’t let me past the gate.”  
“And rightly so. The wolfswood is full of danger; your last ride should have taught you that. Would you want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the Lannisters?”  
“**Summer would save me**,” Bran insisted stubbornly. “Princes should be allowed to sail the sea and hunt boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances.”  
“Bran, child, why do you torment yourself so? One day you may do some of these things, but now you are only a boy of eight.”  
“I’d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and Sansa. I’d smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I’d fight beside him like Grey Wind. I’d tear out the Kingslayer’s throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over and everyone would come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf . . .” He howled. “Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.”  
Luwin raised his voice. “A true prince would welcome—”  
“AAHOOOOOOO,” Bran howled, louder. “OOOO-OOOO-OOOO.”  
– A Clash of Kings – Bran I

Luwin, it seems that YOU have forgotten that when Summer tore that man’s throat out it was saving Bran and Catelyn’s life.  Bran even argues that Summer would protect him, but Luwin is so sure that everyone else needs protection from the wolves that he is unable to remember!

The other key takeway is that spending nights as a direwolf is definitely rubbing off on Bran.  It’s cute, but Bran it bears remembering that Bran is impressionable to Summer’s wolfishness.

As an aside, all the howling in that chapter reminds me of the Ozzy Osbourne song “Bark at the Moon”.  I’ve made a recording of that song, and I will be using it on a post on YouTube.

The theme of the wolves being protectors is doubled-down on in the following chapter, in addition to further discussion of wolf dreams.  The boys do get a chance to play with them in the godswood, but the wolves remain confined there at night.  Chekhov’s confinement.  Bran does seem to make a point of visiting whenever he can, suggesting continued affection.  We also see of the wolves’ savagery, their threat to enemies, sense of threats, and pack behavior.

&gt;**A Clash of Kings – Bran II**  
“Let him. I always wanted a wolfskin cloak.”  
“**Summer would tear your fat head off**,” Bran said.  
Little Walder banged a mailed fist against his breastplate. “Does your wolf have steel teeth, to bite through plate and mail?”  
\[…\]  
“As you will, my prince,” said Ser Rodrik. “You did well.” Bran flushed with pleasure. Being a lord was not so tedious as he had feared, and since Lady Hornwood had been so much briefer than Lord Manderly, he even had a few hours of daylight left to **visit with Summer**. He liked to spend time with his wolf every day, when Ser Rodrik and the maester allowed it.  
No sooner had Hodor entered the godswood than **Summer emerged from under an oak,** almost as if he had known they were coming. Bran glimpsed a lean black shape watching from the undergrowth as well. “Shaggy,” he called. “Here, Shaggydog. To me.” But Rickon’s wolf vanished as swiftly as he’d appeared.  
\[…\]  
And then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash, so sudden that even Summer leapt back, snarling. Hodor jumped away, wailing “Hodor, Hodor” in dismay until Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his fears. “How can you swim in there?” he asked Osha. “Isn’t it cold?”  
“As a babe I suckled on icicles, boy. I like the cold.” Osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping. She was naked, her skin bumpy with gooseprickles. **Summer** **crept close and sniffed at her**. “I wanted to touch the bottom.”  
\[…\]  
“He’d never dare hurt me. **He’s scared of Summer**, no matter what he says.”  
“Then might be he’s not so stupid as he seems.” **Osha was always wary around the direwolves**. The day she was taken, Summer and Grey Wind between them had torn three wildlings to bloody pieces. “Or might be he is. And that tastes of trouble too.” She tied up her hair. “You have more of them wolf dreams?”  
“No.” **He did not like to talk about the dreams.**  
“A prince should lie better than that.” Osha laughed. “Well, your dreams are your business. Mine’s in the kitchens, and I’d best be getting back before Gage starts to shouting and waving that big wooden spoon of his. By your leave, my prince.”  
**She should never have talked about the wolf dreams**, Bran thought as Hodor carried him up the steps to his bedchamber. **He fought against sleep as long as he could**, but in the end it took him as it always did. On this night he dreamed of the weirwood. It was looking at him with its deep red eyes, calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth, and from its pale branches the three-eyed crow came flapping, pecking at his face and crying his name in a voice as sharp as swords.  
– A Clash of Kings – Bran II

Notice at the end of that passage how Bran is now not happy about having the dreams.  Could it be that he still likes the wolf dreams and it’s the other dreams he’s not happy about?  Could it be that he is realizing they are real and he is going into Summer?  Could Summer’s mood about being confined be affecting Bran?  Could he be worried about being a warg?  I think the answer to all these questions is “YES”.  Chiefly though, it’s probably the last question that bothers him.  Wargs don’t have a good reputation in many of the stories Old Nan has told him, especially the scary ones that Bran used to like.

In the next chapter, we are again reminded of the wolves’ confinement, and during Bran’s first meeting with the Reeds we are also reminded of Summer’s ability to keep Shaggydog in check.

&gt;**A Clash of Kings – Bran III**  
Dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of House Stark, while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet, his sleeves and collar trimmed with vair. Over his heart was his wolf’s-head brooch of silver and polished jet. **He would sooner have had Summer** than a silver wolf on his breast, but Ser Rodrik had been unyielding.  
\[…\]  
“They won’t bite if I’m there.” Bran was pleased that they wanted to see the wolves. “**Summer won’t anyway, and he’ll keep Shaggydog away**.” He was curious about these mudmen. He could not recall ever seeing one before. His father had sent letters to the Lord of Greywater over the years, but none of the crannogmen had ever called at Winterfell. He would have liked to talk to them more, but the Great Hall was so noisy that it was hard to hear anyone who wasn’t right beside you.

Finally, we get our first vivid depiction of a wolf dream, through Summer’s eyes when the Reeds visit the Godswood.  Not how the author bridges the boy’s thoughts with the wolf’s thoughts using the sense of smell.  Masterful.  The first wolf thoughts are of pack and the instinct to hunt.  Then, when the Reeds enter, he notes that they had no taint of fear, likely a scent-related observation.  Note also Jojen’s observation about Summer/Bran’s power.  Jojen’s also admits later that he sensed Bran inside Summer.

&gt;He went to sleep with his head full of knights in gleaming armor, fighting with swords that shone like starfire, but when the dream came he was in the godswood again. The **smells from the kitchen and the Great Hall** were so strong that it was almost as if he had never left the feast. **He prowled beneath the trees, his brother close behind him.** This night was wildly alive, full of the howling of the man-pack at their play. The sounds made him restless. He wanted to run, to hunt, he wanted to—  
The rattle of iron made his ears prick up. His brother heard it too. They raced through the undergrowth toward the sound. Bounding across the still water at the foot of the old white one, he caught the scent of a stranger, the man-smell well mixed with leather and earth and iron.  
The intruders had pushed a few yards into the wood when he came upon them; a female and a young male, **with no taint of fear to them**, even when he showed them the white of his teeth.  
His brother growled low in his throat, yet still they did not run.  
“Here they come,” the female said. Meera, some part of him whispered, some wisp of the sleeping boy lost in the wolf dream. “Did you know they would be so big?”  
“They will be bigger still before they are grown,” the young male said, watching them with eyes large, green, and unafraid. “The black one is full of fear and rage, but the **grey is strong . . . stronger than he knows** . . . can you feel him, sister?”  
“No,” she said, moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore. “Go careful, Jojen.”  
“He won’t hurt me. This is not the day I die.” The male walked toward them, unafraid, and reached out for his muzzle, a touch as light as a summer breeze. Yet at the brush of those fingers the wood dissolved and the very ground turned to smoke beneath his feet and swirled away laughing, and then he was spinning and falling, falling, falling . . .  
– A Clash of Kings – Bran III

Both Reeds, Jojen especially, seem quite aware of the way of wargs and are completely comfortable around the wolves, too comfortable as we find out later.

That comfort continues without concern early in the next chapter as Meera plays with Summer.  She even muses how mild-tempered Summer is, when Bran agrees that Summer wouldn’t hurt them.  Summer certainly doesn’t consider them a threat, and Bran obviously likes both Jojen and Meera, so he’s mirroring Bran’s good humor, especially in the affection for Meera.  It’s quite endearing.  Still, summer is undoubtedly acting as a wolf, and the way he hunts her is reminiscent of the way he was very careful during the attack on the wildlings in AGoT.  Later Bran and Summer have another touching affectionate moment as well.

&gt;**A Clash of Kings – Bran IV**  
Meera moved in a wary circle, her net dangling loose in her left hand, the slender three-pronged frog spear poised in her right. **Summer followed her with his golden eyes, turning, his tail held stiff and tall. Watching, watching** . . .  
“Yai!” the girl shouted, the spear darting out. The wolf slid to the left and leapt before she could draw back the spear. Meera cast her net, the tangles unfolding in the air before her. Summer’s leap carried him into it. He dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward. Her spear went spinning away. The damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an “Oof.” The wolf crouched atop her.  
Bran hooted. “You lose.”  
“She wins,” her brother Jojen said. “Summer’s snared.”  
He was right, Bran saw. Thrashing and growling at the net, trying to rip free, Summer was only ensnaring himself worse. Nor could he bite through. “Let him out.”  
Laughing, the Reed girl **threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both.** Summer gave a piteous whine, his legs kicking against the cords that bound them. Meera knelt, undid a twist, pulled at a corner, tugged deftly here and there, and suddenly the direwolf was bounding free.  
“Summer, to me.” Bran spread his arms. “Watch,” he said, an instant before **the wolf bowled into him**. He clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the grass. They wrestled and rolled and clung to each other, one snarling and yapping, the other laughing. In the end it was Bran sprawled on top, the mud-spattered direwolf under him. “Good wolf,” he panted. Summer licked him across the ear.  
Meera shook her head. “**Does he never grow angry**?”  
“Not with me.” Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely, but it was all in play. “Sometimes he tears my garb but he’s never drawn blood.”  
“Your blood, you mean. If he’d gotten past my net . . .”  
“**He wouldn’t hurt you. He knows I like you**.” All of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast, but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran’s constant companions. Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him “little grandfather,” but Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya. She wasn’t scared to get dirty, and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy. She was older than Arya, though; almost sixteen, a woman grown. They were both older than Bran, even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone, but they never treated him like a child.  
“I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders.” He began to struggle toward the nearest tree. His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch, but when Meera moved to lift him he said, “No, don’t help me.” He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward, using the strength of his arms, until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash. “See, I told you.” Summer lay down with his head in Bran’s lap. “I never knew anyone who fought with a net before,” he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears. “Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting?”

Summer’s affection for Bran and Meera doesn’t appear to extend to Jojen. When he joins the exchange he quickly moves on to the supernatural, implying that Bran is “the winged wolf” of his dream.  The assertion that the wolf is held by “grey stone chains” seems a rather heavy-handed implication that maester Luwin and Winterfell itself are holding Bran back from achieving his magical potential.  I do wonder if there is a larger prophecy around this figure of the winged wolf, or if it is first introduced into Westerosi lore by Jojen.

In any case, Summer mirrors Bran, by first acting intrigued by the conversation and then acting defensive when Bran wants to change the subject to things Bran is uncomfortable with.

&gt;Jojen’s eyes were the color of moss, and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else. Like now. “I dreamed of a **winged wolf** **bound to earth with grey stone chains**,” he said. “It was a green dream, so I knew it was true. A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.  
“Did the crow have three eyes?”  
Jojen nodded.  
**Summer raised his head from Bran’s lap, and gazed at the mudman** with his dark golden eyes.  
“When I was little I almost died of greywater fever. That was when the crow came to me.”  
\[…\]  
“I only have two.”  
“You have three. The crow gave you the third, but you will not open it.” He had a slow soft way of speaking. “With two eyes you see my face. With three you could see my heart. With two you can see that oak tree there. With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become. With two you see no farther than your walls. With three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall.”  
**Summer got to his feet. “I don’t need to see so far.”** Bran made a nervous smile. “I’m tired of talking about crows. Let’s talk about wolves. Or lizard-lions. Have you ever hunted one, Meera? We don’t have them here.”

Then, the chapter takes a dangerous turn, when Jojen’s intrusive “dream” questions make Bran uncomfortable and then angry.  Summer continues to mirror Bran’s mood.  As the situation escalates, it shows the lie to Bran’s earlier assertion that Summer wouldn’t hurt them.  He would if Bran’s mood led there.  Also, we see Summer’s independence again as he does not obey immediately when Bran calls him off.  Bran says that he wants Summer to stop threatening the Reeds, but Summer independently follows his mood, not his command. We also see pack behavior as Shaggydog joins Summer in threatening the Reeds.  Bran’s assertion that they won’t hurt Hodor is dubious, given how he had only just insisted that Summer wouldn’t hurt Meera either.  At the end of it all, Summer lays next to Bran.  This could be interpreted as affection or a protectiveness.

There is a lot exposed in this passage so I’ve kept it mostly intact, bolding a lot of the important lines. In parallel to the near attack, Bran is consciously realizing (possibly for the first time) through Jojen’s dialogue, that his wolf dreams are actually real dreams inside Summer.  His anger comes as Jojen forces him to admit this fact, even as Bran is in denial.

&gt;“No,” said Bran. “I told you, I don’t want—”  
“Did you dream of a wolf?”  
**He was making Bran angry.** “I don’t have to tell you my dreams. I’m the prince. I’m the Stark in Winterfell.”  
“**Was it Summer**?”  
“You be quiet.”  
“The night of the harvest feast, you dreamed you were **Summer in the godswood**, didn’t you?”  
“Stop it!” Bran shouted. **Summer slid toward the weirwood, his white teeth bared**.  
Jojen Reed took no mind. “When I touched Summer, I felt you in him. Just as you are in him now.”  
“You couldn’t have. I was in bed. I was sleeping.”  
“You were in the godswood, all in grey.”  
**“It was only a bad dream . . .”**  
Jojen stood. “I felt you. I felt you fall. Is that what scares you, the falling?”  
**The falling, Bran thought, and the golden man, the queen’s brother, he scares me too, but mostly the falling.** He did not say it, though. How could he? He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin, and he could not tell the Reeds either. If he didn’t talk about it, maybe he would forget. He had never wanted to remember. It might not even be a true remembering.  
“Do you fall every night, Bran?” Jojen asked quietly.  
A low rumbling growl rose from Summer’s throat, and there was no play in it. He stalked forward, all teeth and hot eyes. Meera stepped between the wolf and her brother, spear in hand. “Keep him back, Bran.”  
“Jojen is making him angry.”  
Meera shook out her net.  
**“It’s your anger, Bran,” her brother said. “Your fear.”**  
**It isn’t. I’m not a wolf.**” Yet he’d howled with them in the night, and **tasted blood in his wolf dreams**.  
**“Part of you is Summer, and part of Summer is you. You know that, Bran.”**  
**Summer rushed forward**, but Meera blocked him, jabbing with the three-pronged spear. The wolf twisted aside, circling, stalking. Meera turned to face him. “Call him back, Bran.”  
“**Summer!” Bran shouted. “To me, Summer!”** He slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh. His hand tingled, though his dead leg felt nothing.  
The direwolf lunged again, and again Meera’s spear darted out. Summer dodged, circled back. The bushes rustled, and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood, teeth bared. The scent was strong; his brother had smelled his rage. Bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck. Meera stood beside her brother, with wolves to either side. “Bran, call them off.”  
“I can’t!”  
“Jojen, up the tree.”  
“There’s no need. Today is not the day I die.”  
“Do it!” she screamed, and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood, using the face for his handholds. The direwolves closed. Meera abandoned spear and net, jumped up, and grabbed the branch above her head. Shaggy’s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb. Summer sat back on his haunches and howled, while Shaggydog worried the net, shaking it in his teeth.  
Only then did Bran remember that they were not alone. He cupped hands around his mouth. “Hodor!” he shouted. “Hodor! Hodor!” He was badly frightened and somehow ashamed. “**They won’t hurt Hodor**,” he assured his treed friends.  
A few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming. Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools, but Bran had never been so glad to see him. “Hodor, help me. Chase off the wolves. Chase them off.”  
Hodor went to it gleefully, waving his arms and stamping his huge feet, shouting “Hodor, Hodor,” running first at one wolf and then the other. Shaggydog was the first to flee, slinking back into the foliage with a final snarl. When Summer had enough, he **came back to Bran and lay down beside him**.  
No sooner did Meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again. Jojen never took his eyes off Summer. “We will talk again,” he promised Bran.  
**It was the wolves, it wasn’t me.** He did not understand why they’d gotten so wild. Maybe Maester Luwin was right to lock them in the godswood. “Hodor,” he said, “bring me to Maester Luwin.”

Summer mirrors Bran’s mood throughout that passage; that’s plain.  It’s worth considering how much Bran may have been directly feeding Summer’s actions through their bond.  Bran never thinks of himself as a wolf, so he’s clearly not warging him, but does this passage represent their consciousnesses blending to some degree as Bran gets more and more agitated?  I’d like to think yes, but I can’t be sure.

Later, Bran is still in denial, but that won’t last long.  He is placing his faith in Maester’s Luwin’s increasingly blind assertions that magic doesn’t exist or is gone from the world.  Meera sees through that façade.

&gt;“No, my prince. Jojen Reed may have had a dream or two that he believes came true, but he does not have the greensight. No living man has that power.”  
Bran said as much to Meera Reed when she came to him at dusk as he sat in his window seat watching the lights flicker to life. “I’m sorry for what happened with the wolves. **Summer shouldn’t have tried to hurt Jojen, but Jojen shouldn’t have said all that about my dreams.** The crow lied when he said I could fly, and your brother lied too.”  
“Or perhaps your maester is wrong.”  
– A Clash of Kings – Bran IV

This chapter bears summarizing.  Jojen says that a part of Summer is in Bran and vice versa. This is the first time this concept is explained in the text, but it immediately rings true.  He also repeatedly mentions the “winged wolf” and hangs the moniker on Bran. He also confirms that he’s also dreamed of the three-eyed crow (3icrow).

We also find out that Bran does partially remember Jaime Lannister pushing him, which is part of the reason he doesn’t want real dreams is the golden man and falling.  He must be having a recurring nightmare about this.  However, I think the fears about being a warg discussed prior are also true because of Bran’s assertion that he’s not a wolf and that the wolves caused the incident, not him.  Both assertions smack of denial.

He seems terrified of being labelled a warg, which relates back to Old Nan’s stories. The next chapter proves it.  Jojen also repeats the mantra of the winged wolf and also hangs the monikers of “Warg” and “beastling” on Bran.  He is not diplomatic at all; he seems intent on piercing Bran’s denial.  It’s starting to work, but it makes Bran more fearful than ever.

&gt;He was scared, even then, but he had sworn to trust them, and a Stark of Winterfell keeps his sworn word. “There’s different kinds,” he said slowly. “**There’s the wolf dreams, those aren’t so bad as the others**. I run and hunt and kill squirrels. And there’s dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly. Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too, calling my name. That frightens me. But the worst dreams are when I fall.” He looked down into the yard, feeling miserable. “I never used to fall before. When I climbed. I went everyplace, up on the roofs and along the walls, I used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower. Mother was afraid that I would fall but I knew I never would. Only I did, and now when I sleep, I fall all the time.”  
Meera gave his shoulder a squeeze. “Is that all?”  
“I guess.”  
“**Warg**,” said Jojen Reed.  
Bran looked at him, his eyes wide. “What?”  
“**Warg. Shapechanger. Beastling**. That is what they will call you, if they should ever hear of your **wolf dreams**.”  
The names made him afraid again. “Who will call me?”  
“Your own folk. In fear. Some will hate you if they know what you are. Some will even try to kill you.”  
**Old Nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers** sometimes. In the stories **they were always evil**. “I’m not like that,” Bran said. “I’m not. It’s only dreams.”  
“The wolf dreams are no true dreams. You have your eye closed tight whenever you’re awake, but as you drift off it flutters open and your soul seeks out its other half. **The power is strong in you**.”  
“I don’t want it. I want to be a knight.”  
“A knight is what you want. **A warg is what you are**. You can’t change that, Bran, you can’t deny it or push it away. **You are the winged wolf, but you will never fly**.” Jojen got up and walked to the window. “Unless you open your eye.” He put two fingers together and poked Bran in the forehead, hard.  
When he raised his hand to the spot, Bran felt only the smooth unbroken skin. There was no eye, not even a closed one. “How can I open it if it’s not there?”

So Jojen has been trying to get him to open his eye, just like the 3iCrow.  He tells Bran that they’re all going to call him a Warg.  I’m not so sure that following Jojen’s advice is such a great idea.  Bran is facing his fears which is to the good, but these dreams would freak out anybody and with good reason.  Let’s separate the ability to Warg, and the entreaty to go north to the 3iCrow.  I’m all for Bran developing his power to skinchanger, but I don’t trust 3i. Those dreams make me uneasy.  The whole situation makes Bran fearful.

# A Storm of Swords – Summer and The Winged Wolf – Unchained

In the third volume, now that Bran is unchained and has accepted his nature as a warg, we see him develop his skills with the help of Jojen.  He becomes so adept in Summer’s skin that he is able to save Jon’s life.  This shows his progress as a warg while serving to remind us of his empathy and the pack bond to Jon.  As a darker turn we also see him use this power over Hodor.  The development of these powers is unique to Bran among his siblings.

Still, our other themes continue.  Summer continues to show his independence while being fiercely protective of Bran. Toward the end of the volume, Summer is twice separated from Bran resulting is near misses reminding us of the theme of bad things happening when the wolves are separated from the children (parallel to the final reminder for Grey Wind and Robb).  This might be a concern going forward.  Pack remains important; we get some direct wolf thoughts about the bond to the other direwolves from Summer, that he periodically senses his siblings.  This will be contrasted to similar thoughts we get in ADwD from Ghost.

We start with a wolf dream.  Notice that the language of the first paragraphs seem to be more boy thoughts than wolf thoughts with a mention of specific tree species, while the thoughts become more wolfish as the dream continues.  As Summer begins to exert his own thoughts Bran still puts in his own ideas.  These deliberate warging adventures are much more a mind meld than when Bran was mostly riding along in Summer with the earlier wolf dreams.

Note also that Summer climbs a hill, just as Ghost did in this same volume.  Are they trying to contact each other?  Count this one as pack behavior for sure.

Once Summer begins to think of his sibling wolves though, Bran seems relegated to passenger, though.  I glean much from these thoughts though.  Summer can remember **and feel** his siblings, but we don’t get any detail beyond him knowing that Lady is dead and Shaggy is close but getting farther.  He know’s they are hunting, but we get no detail at all about Nymeria, Ghost and Grey Wind. Recall from my intro to Nymeria’s story that I believe Shaggy and Ghost to be stronger in the magic that’s the other wolves, so it makes sense that Shaggy would be the easiest to sense (with Ghost beyond the wall, seemingly incommunicado), though this passage isn’t strong proof of that idea, given that he is also in closer physical proximity.

The final paragraph of the remembrance is awkward.  It seems that Summer is remembering Lady (or is it Nymeria?), but I almost get the feeling that Bran is trying to assert his own thoughts at the same time, making the paragraph a bit hard to follow, possibly intentionally incoherent by our author trying to portray the dissimilar thoughts together, like trying to fit the wrong pieces of a puzzle together.  I definitely believe that the final line, “The wolf prince remembered,” is a Bran thought.

&gt;**A Storm of Swords – Bran I**  
&gt;  
&gt;The ridge slanted sharply from the earth, a long fold of stone and soil shaped like a claw. Trees clung to its lower slopes, pines and **hawthorn and ash**, but higher up the ground was bare, the ridgeline stark against the cloudy sky.  
&gt;  
&gt;**He could feel the high stone calling him. Up he went, loping easy at first, then faster and higher, his strong legs eating up the incline.** Birds burst from the branches overhead as he raced by, clawing and flapping their way into the sky. He could hear the wind sighing up amongst the leaves, the squirrels chittering to one another, even the sound a pinecone made as it tumbled to the forest floor. The smells were a song around him, a song that filled the good green world.  
Gravel flew from beneath his paws as he gained the last few feet to stand upon the crest. The sun hung above the tall pines huge and red, and below him the trees and hills went on and on as far as he could see or smell. A kite was circling far above, dark against the pink sky.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Prince. The man-sound came into his head suddenly**, yet he could feel the rightness of it. Prince of the green, prince of the wolfswood. He was strong and swift and fierce, and all that lived in the good green world went in fear of him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Far below, at the base of the woods, something moved amongst the trees. A flash of grey, quick-glimpsed and gone again, but it was enough to make his ears prick up. Down there beside a swift green brook, another form slipped by, running. Wolves, he knew. His little cousins, chasing down some prey. Now the prince could see more of them, shadows on fleet grey paws. A pack.  
He had a pack as well, once. Five they had been, and a sixth who stood aside. Somewhere down inside him were the sounds the men had given them to tell one from the other, but it was not by their sounds he knew them. He remembered their scents, his brothers and his sisters. They all had smelled alike, had smelled of pack, but each was different too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**His angry brother with the hot green eyes was near, the prince felt**, though he had not seen him for many hunts. Yet with every sun that set he grew more distant, and he had been the last. The others were far scattered, like leaves blown by the wild wind.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sometimes he could sense them, though, as if they were still with him, only hidden from his sight by a boulder or a stand of trees. He could not smell them, nor hear their howls by night, yet he felt their presence at his back . . . all but the sister they had lost.** His tail drooped when he remembered her. Four now, not five. Four and one more, the white who has no voice.  
These woods belonged to them, the snowy slopes and stony hills, the great green pines and the golden leaf oaks, the rushing streams and blue lakes fringed with fingers of white frost. **But his sister had left the wilds, to walk in the halls of man-rock where other hunters ruled, and once within those halls it was hard to find the path back out. The wolf prince remembered.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The wind shifted suddenly.

The next part of this chapter shows Summer in complete control.  The call of the hunt and the pack are strong themes still. With his pack is scattered, he immediately runs down his cousin’s pack and their prey.  It is reminiscent of when Summer and Grey Wind were not around to protect the boys from Stiv during a much earlier hunt; this is a weakness in the direwolves’ roles as protectors.

Once he finds the wolves, Bran might have a quick thought about the lack of fear in the opponent, but then Summer seems to take over again in the fight.   Note the Summer easily kills the one wolf.  The savage act serves to remind how merciless these wolves are in battle.

&gt;**Deer, and fear, and blood. The scent of prey woke the hunger in him.** The prince sniffed the air again, turning, and then he was off, bounding along the ridgetop with jaws half-parted. The far side of the ridge was steeper than the one he’d come up, but he flew surefoot over stones and roots and rotting leaves, down the slope and through the trees, long strides eating up the ground. The scent pulled him onward, ever faster.  
&gt;  
&gt;The deer was down and dying when he reached her, ringed by eight of his small grey cousins. The heads of the pack had begun to feed, the male first and then his female, taking turns tearing flesh from the red underbelly of their prey. The others waited patiently, all but the tail, who paced in a wary circle a few strides from the rest, his own tail tucked low. He would eat the last of all, whatever his brothers left him.  
&gt;  
&gt;The prince was downwind, so they did not sense him until he leapt up upon a fallen log six strides from where they fed. The tail saw him first, gave a piteous whine, and slunk away. His pack brothers turned at the sound and bared their teeth, snarling, all but the head male and female.  
&gt;  
&gt;The direwolf answered the snarls with a low warning growl and showed them his own teeth. He was bigger than his cousins, twice the size of the scrawny tail, half again as large as the two pack heads. He leapt down into their midst, and three of them broke, melting away into the brush. Another came at him, teeth snapping. He met the attack head on, caught the wolf’s leg in his jaws when they met, and flung him aside yelping and limping.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then there was only the head wolf to face, the great grey male with his bloody muzzle fresh from the prey’s soft belly. There was white on his muzzle as well, to mark him as an old wolf, but when his mouth opened, red slaver ran from his teeth.  
&gt;  
&gt;**He has no fear, the prince thought, no more than me. It would be a good fight.** They went for each other.  
&gt;  
&gt;Long they fought, rolling together over roots and stones and fallen leaves and the scattered entrails of the prey, tearing at each other with tooth and claw, breaking apart, circling each round the other, and bolting in to fight again. The prince was larger, and much the stronger, but his cousin had a pack. The female prowled around them closely, snuffing and snarling, and would interpose herself whenever her mate broke off bloodied. From time to time the other wolves would dart in as well, to snap at a leg or an ear when the prince was turned the other way. **One angered him so much that he whirled in a black fury and tore out the attacker’s throat.** After that the others kept their distance.  
&gt;  
&gt;And as the last red light was filtering through green boughs and golden, the old wolf lay down weary in the dirt, and rolled over to expose his throat and belly. It was submission.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The prince sniffed at him and licked the blood from fur and torn flesh. When the old wolf gave a soft whimper, the direwolf turned away. He was very hungry now, and the prey was his.

Then Jojen begins to try to wake Bran; Summer and Bran both are annoyed!  Jojen says Bran has been in the wolf too long, and he painstakingly talks about how Bran can’t sustain himself solely by eating in the wolf.  The feeling of hunger in the boys body, while the wolf is sated must again be a bit confusing for Bran, but I kinda agree that Jojen is being stupid.  Depriving Bran of the satisfaction of eating after the hunt seems unnecessarily mean.  It would have annoyed me too. One would think Bran, once back in his body would feel hunger and choose to eat naturally.  As we discussed at the end of the prior volume, Bran wouldn’t feel his appetite properly as a boy after the wold fed, but suppose Jojen would not know this.  I suppose Bran could be losing weight because of this issue.

Illustrating my point, Bran’ after waking can still taste the deer. I believe he is sensing this through the bond.  Jon has similar experiences.

u/Prof_Cecily on Reddit suggested to me that the group is starving here and they asked him about marking trees to solely to enable Meera to find the kill.  I doubt this to be the whole explanation.  If Meera is any kind of decent tracker she could do so without Bran giving unnatural signs, and this reason wasn’t mentioned in the text.  Also, the group isn’t mentioned as starving until the next chapter, when they leave the wood.  That said, they do explicitly say to have Summer bring a rabbit back uneaten, so hunting to feed the entire group is part of the requests.

IMO it is also that Jojen is concerned with Bran asserting his own personality over Summer, not to be overwhelmed by the wolf’s personality while warging.  The line “once he was a wolf they never seemed important,” coupled with my above observations of the warging experience tells me that Bran’s thoughts are definitely overwhelmed by Summer’s, at least in part.  Is he concerned that Bran might lose some of his humanity, get lost in the wolf’s mind, never to return to the boy’s body?  Perhaps, though the latter would be extreme.

&gt;**The sudden sound made him stop and snarl.** The wolves regarded him with green and yellow eyes, bright with the last light of day. **None of them had heard it. It was a queer wind that blew only in his ears.** He buried his jaws in the deer’s belly and tore off a mouthful of flesh.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**No, he thought. No, I won’t.** It was a boy’s thought, not a direwolf’s. The woods were darkening all about him, until only the shadows of the trees remained, and the glow of his cousins’ eyes. And through those and behind those eyes, he saw a big man’s grinning face, and a stone vault whose walls were spotted with niter. The rich warm taste of blood faded on his tongue. No, don’t, don’t, I want to eat, I want to, I want . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
The woods and wolves were gone. Bran was back again, down in the damp vault of some ancient watchtower that must have been abandoned thousands of years before. It wasn’t much of a tower now. Even the tumbled stones were so overgrown with moss and ivy that you could hardly see them until you were right on top of them. “Tumbledown Tower,” Bran had named the place; it was Meera who found the way down into the vault, however.  
“You were gone too long.” Jojen Reed was thirteen, only four years older than Bran. Jojen wasn’t much bigger either, no more than two inches or maybe three, but he had a solemn way of talking that made him seem older and wiser than he really was. At Winterfell, Old Nan had dubbed him “little grandfather.”  
Bran frowned at him. **“I wanted to eat.”**  
\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m sick of frogs.” Meera was a frogeater from the Neck, so Bran couldn’t really blame her for catching so many frogs, he supposed, but even so . . . **“I wanted to eat the deer.”** For a moment he **remembered the taste of it, the blood and the raw rich meat, and his mouth watered.** I won the fight for it. I won.  
&gt;  
&gt;“**Did you mark the trees?**”  
&gt;  
&gt;Bran flushed. **Jojen was always telling him to do things when he opened his third eye** and put on Summer’s skin. To claw the bark of a tree, to **catch a rabbit and bring it back in his jaws uneaten**, to push some rocks in a line. Stupid things. “I forgot,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;It was true. He meant to do the things that Jojen asked, but once he was a wolf they never seemed important. There were always things to see and things to smell, a whole green world to hunt. And he could run! There was nothing better than running, unless it was running after prey. “I was a prince, Jojen,” he told the older boy. “I was the prince of the woods.”

The next exchange continues the idea that Bran needs to exert his own will while warging; he insists that Bran audibly delineate that he and Summer are separate entities.  Even so, the bond seems to be extremely strong now, as Bran immediately says “and one” directly after saying they are two individuals.

Later, Bran muses that Jojen is a bit clueless about not being able to recognize Summer’s howl.  Note that Bran probably hears Summer’;s howls internally at this point, as Arya and Jon have similar experiences in this volume.  Bran also thinks about how far Summer went, confirming 2 things 1) that Bran definitely is fully conscious and able to remember all of the time while in Summer, and 2) that he could likely lead them to the kill if the need for meat that were the sole reason for marking trees / etc.

To continue that point, the exchange concludes with Jojen worrying specifically about **Bran remaining forever in Summer.**  This solidifies for me that these “lessons” from Jojen are **mostly about Bran learning to exert his will more** than they are about hunting.   also wonder if Shaggydog and Rickon will have a similar issue.  It might not go as well without someone like Jojen to mentor him.

&gt;“And who is Summer?” Jojen prompted.  
&gt;  
&gt;“My direwolf.” He smiled. “Prince of the green.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Bran the boy and Summer the wolf. You are two, then?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“**Two,” he sighed, “and one**.” He hated Jojen when he got stupid like this. At Winterfell he wanted me to dream my wolf dreams, and now that I know how he’s always calling me back.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Before Meera could find a reply to that, they heard the sound; the distant howl of a wolf, drifting through the night. “Summer?” asked Jojen, listening.  
&gt;  
&gt;“No.” Bran knew the voice of his direwolf.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Are you certain?” said the little grandfather.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Certain.” **Summer had wandered far afield today**, and would not be back till dawn. Maybe Jojen dreams green, **but he can’t tell a wolf from a direwolf.** He wondered why they all listened to Jojen so much. He was not a prince like Bran, nor big and strong like Hodor, nor as good a hunter as Meera, yet somehow it was always Jojen telling them what to do. “We should steal horses like Meera wants,” Bran said, “and ride to the Umbers up at Last Hearth.” He thought a moment. “Or we could steal a boat and sail down the White Knife to White Harbor town. That fat Lord Manderly rules there, he was friendly at the harvest feast. He wanted to build ships. Maybe he built some, and we could sail to Riverrun and bring Robb home with all his army. Then it wouldn’t matter who knew I was alive. Robb wouldn’t let anyone hurt us.”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;“Jojen, what did you mean about a teacher?” Bran asked. “You’re my teacher. I know I never marked the tree, but I will the next time. My third eye is open like you wanted . . .”  
&gt;  
&gt;**“So wide open that I fear you may fall through it, and live all the rest of your days as a wolf of the woods.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;**“I won’t, I promise.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;“The boy promises. **Will the wolf remember**? You run with Summer, you hunt with him, kill with him . . . **but you bend to his will more than him to yours**.”  
&gt;  
&gt;– A Storm of Swords – Bran I

The next chapter starts by mentioning that they **are** hungry now, having moved into the mountains.  It then backtracks and then says that Summer was bringing them prey before they left the wood.  This indicates that Bran has been able assert his will to teach Summer to do that, so the lessons must have worked to some extent.

&gt;**A Storm of Swords – Bran II**  
&gt;  
&gt;“**If we took the kingsroad we wouldn’t be so hungry either**,” he started saying then. Down in the hills they’d had no lack of food. Meera was a fine huntress, and even better at taking fish from streams with her three-pronged frog spear. Bran liked to watch her, admiring her quickness, the way she sent the spear lancing down and pulled it back with a silvery trout wriggling on the end of it. And they had Summer hunting for them as well. The direwolf vanished most every night as the sun went down, but he was always back again before dawn, **most often with something in his jaws, a squirrel or a hare**.  
&gt;  
&gt;But here in the mountains, the streams were smaller and more icy, and the game scarcer. Meera still hunted and fished when she could, but it was harder, and **some nights even Summer found no prey**. Often, they went to sleep with empty bellies.

Later, Bran knows that the mountain folk have seen them traversing the land because he saw them looking through Summer’s eyes.  This Indicates that he is using Summer’s eyes while not fully warging Summer, similar to how Arya used the cat’s eyes as the blind girl.  Summer then finds them the cave, probably while Bran is warging.  Following that , we see another affectionate/protective scene with Bran and Summer close, though once Summer feels Bran needs no protection from the Liddle, he feels the call of the hunt.  This brings on another wolf dream.

&gt;“They know.” Bran had seen them watching; not with his own eyes, but **with Summer’s sharper ones, that missed so little.** “They won’t bother us so long as we don’t try and make off with their goats or horses.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Nor did they. Only once did they encounter any of the mountain people, when a sudden burst of freezing rain sent them looking for shelter. **Summer found it for them, sniffing out a shallow cave** behind the grey-green branches of a towering sentinel tree, but when Hodor ducked beneath the stony overhang, Bran saw the orange glow of fire farther back and realized they were not alone. “Come in and warm yourselves,” a man’s voice called out. “There’s stone enough to keep the rain off all our heads.”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;“The Bastard’s boys, aye. He was dead, but now he’s not. And paying good silver for wolfskins, a man hears, and maybe gold for word of certain other walking dead.” He looked at Bran when he said that, and at **Summer stretched out beside him**. “As to that Wall,” the man went on, “it’s not a place that I’d be going. The Old Bear took the Watch into the haunted woods, and all that come back was his ravens, with hardly a message between them. Dark wings, dark words, me mother used to say, but when the birds fly silent, seems to me that’s even darker.” He poked at the fire with his stick. “It was different when there was a Stark in Winterfell. But the old wolf’s dead and young one’s gone south to play the game of thrones, and all that’s left us is the ghosts.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“The wolves will come again,” said Jojen solemnly.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;They spent that night together, for the rain did not let up till well past dark, and only **Summer seemed to want to leave the cave**. When the fire had burned down to embers, Bran let him go. The direwolf did not feel the damp as people did, and the **night was calling him**. Moonlight painted the wet woods in shades of silver and turned the grey peaks white. Owls hooted through the dark and flew silently between the pines, while pale goats moved along the mountainsides. **Bran closed his eyes and gave himself up to the wolf dream**, to the smells and sounds of midnight.

The chapter concludes with Bran attempting and failing to skinchange an eagle. One must wonder if it is Varamyr’s or some other eagle that is being skinchanged.  He probably does have the raw power to do it by this point, but he fails nonetheless.

&gt;Bran lifted his head and saw it, its grey wings spread and still as it floated on the wind. He followed it with his eyes as it circled higher, wondering what it would be like to soar about the world so effortless. Better than climbing, even. He tried to reach the eagle, to leave his stupid crippled body and rise into the sky to join it, the way he joined with Summer. The greenseers could do it. I should be able to do it too. He tried and tried, until the eagle vanished in the golden haze of the afternoon. “It’s gone,” he said, disappointed.  
&gt;  
&gt;– A Storm of Swords – Bran II

The next chapter is where Summer/Bran see Jon in the village with the wildlings.  It starts with Summer running off to hunt again, but I am beginning to wonder if Summer is also scouting for the party; it would make sense as far as the protective instinct goes.  Next, while they hide in Queen’s Crown tower, Bran is worried for Summer when they see first a man, and then a group of wildlings.  Complicating matters, a scared Hodor makes a bunch of noise due to the lightning, so Bran thinks Summer might be scared.  Bran briefly contemplated warging Summer to calm him, but after realizing that Hodor wasn’t going to stop crying out, uses his skin hanging power to enter the big man.  It scares him, and it should.  It is one of Haggon’s abominations, and it is clearly wrong.  We get back to this in ADwD.

&gt;**A Storm of Swords – Bran III**  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the first village they had seen since leaving the foothills. Meera had scouted ahead to make certain there was no one lurking amongst the ruins. Sliding in and amongst oaks and apple trees with her net and spear in hand, she startled three red deer and sent them bounding away through the brush. **Summer saw the flash of motion and was after them at once**. Bran watched the direwolf lope off, and for a moment wanted nothing so much as to slip his skin and run with him, but Meera was waving for them to come ahead. Reluctantly, he turned away from Summer and urged Hodor on, into the village. Jojen walked with them.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Bran shaded his eyes as well, and even so he had to squint. He saw nothing at first, till some movement made him turn. At first he thought it might be Summer, but no. A man on a horse. He was too far away to see much else.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;“Summer’s near the village,” Bran objected.  
&gt;  
&gt;“**Summer will be fine,**” Meera promised. “It’s only one man on a tired horse.”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Dusk was settling by the time duck and tale were done, and the rain still fell. **Bran wondered how far Summer had roamed and whether he had caught one of the deer**.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope Summer isn’t scared too, Bran thought. The dogs in Winterfell’s kennels had always been spooked by thunderstorms, just like Hodor. I should go see, to calm him . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;“**Bran, what did you do**?” Meera whispered.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Nothing.” Bran shook his head. “I don’t know.” But he did. I reached for him, the way I reach for Summer. **He had been Hodor for half a heartbeat. It scared him.**

Bran then thinks of Summer again, deluding himself that he won’t be afraid with all the men in the village and the lightning.  On the next Flash of lightning the fear in Summer is raw, and he wargs him.  After that Summer senses fear among the wildlings and discovers Jon.  Summer is careful, as we’ve seen in other situations of danger, going wide around the sentry.   but eventually the protective instinct must get the better of him, Ashe attacks,

&gt;I won’t be afraid. He was the Prince of Winterfell, Eddard Stark’s son, almost a man grown and a warg too, not some little baby boy like Rickon. **Summer would not be afraid**. “Most like they’re just some Umbers,” he said. “Or they could be Knotts or Norreys or Flints come down from the mountains, or even brothers from the Night’s Watch. Were they wearing black cloaks, Jojen?”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bran could feel Summer’s fear** in that bright instant. He closed two eyes and opened a third, and his boy’s skin slipped off him like a cloak as he left the tower behind . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;. . . and found himself out in the rain, his belly full of deer, cringing in the brush as the sky broke and boomed above him. The smell of rotten apples and wet leaves almost drowned the scent of man, but it was there. He heard the clink and slither of hardskin, saw men moving under the trees. A man with a stick blundered by, a skin pulled up over his head to make him blind and deaf. The wolf went wide around him, behind a dripping thornbush and beneath the bare branches of an apple tree. He could hear them talking, and there beneath the scents of rain and leaves and horse came the **sharp red stench of fear** . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;– A Storm of Swords – Bran III

Eventually the protective instinct must get the better of him, as he attacks saving Jon in the next chapter, a Jon POV.  Jon had no idea the direwolf was so near; and had no idea which one it was either, only piecing together that it must have been Summer much later (not in this chapter and still not knowing the name).  Jon thinks it is Grey Wind, due to the speed and color, but the description certainly shows that Summer is at least the equal of Robb’s wolf in battle.

&gt;**A Storm of Swords – Jon V**  
&gt;  
&gt;**And death leapt down amongst them.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The lightning flash left Jon night-blind, but he glimpsed the **hurtling shadow** half a heartbeat before he heard the shriek. The first Thenn died as the old man had, blood gushing from his torn throat. Then the light was gone and the shape was spinning away, snarling, and another man went down in the dark. There were curses, shouts, howls of pain. Jon saw Big Boil stumble backward and knock down three men behind him. Ghost, he thought for one mad instant. Ghost leapt the Wall. Then the lightning turned the night to day, and he saw the wolf standing on Del’s chest, blood running black from his jaws. Grey. He’s grey.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Long hours later, the rain stopped. Jon found himself alone in a sea of tall black grass. There was a deep throbbing ache in his right thigh. When he looked down, he was surprised to see an arrow jutting out the back of it. When did that happen? He grabbed hold of the shaft and gave it a tug, but the arrowhead was sunk deep in the meat of his leg, and the pain when he pulled on it was excruciating. He tried to think back on the madness at the inn, but **all he could remember was the beast, gaunt and grey and terrible.** It was too large to be a common wolf. A direwolf, then. It had to be. He had never seen an animal move so fast. Like a grey wind . . . Could Robb have returned to the north?  
&gt;  
&gt;– A Storm of Swords – Jon V

Jon thinks of this encounter twice more, which we’ll cover later.  He’s obviously wrong about Grey Wind being there, as he and Robb were headed to the red wedding at the time.  Moving on to Bran’s next chapter, Bran thinks about how he and Summer had a disturbing dream, which obviously was about the red wedding.  I imagine that the dream had something to do with Grey wind’s perspective on the Red wedding?  Either Bran knows after the dream that Robb and Grey Wind are dead.  It is unclear if they are aware of Catelyn’s status, making it more likely that the dream was from Grey Wind, he wouldn’t know of Catelyn’s fate because Robb and their bond died first, so there would be no way for Grey Wind to know her fate.

&gt;**A Storm of Swords – Bran IV**  
&gt;  
&gt;No, thought Bran, it is the Nightfort, and this is the end of the world. In the mountains, all he could think of was reaching the Wall and finding the three-eyed crow, but now that they were here he was filled with fears. **The dream he’d had . . . the dream Summer had had** . . . No, I mustn’t think about that dream. He had not even told the Reeds, though Meera at least seemed to sense that something was wrong. If he never talked of it maybe he could forget he ever dreamed it, and then it wouldn’t have happened and **Robb and Grey Wind would still be** . . .

At the next mention of Summer, they have arrived at the night fort, and Bran is deeply fearful.  He is already thinking about the Rat Cook.  Then he mentions how Summer is even ill at ease.  This is a clear example of Summer mirroring Bran’s emotions.

&gt;Bran forced himself to look around. The morning was cold but bright, the sun shining down from a hard blue sky, but he did not like the noises. The wind made a nervous whistling sound as it shivered through the broken towers, the keeps groaned and settled, and he could hear rats scrabbling under the floor of the great hall. The Rat Cook’s children running from their father. The yards were small forests where spindly trees rubbed their bare branches together and dead leaves scuttled like roaches across patches of old snow. There were trees growing where the stables had been, and a twisted white weirwood pushing up through the gaping hole in the roof of the domed kitchen. Even Summer was not at ease here. Bran slipped inside his skin, just for an instant, to get the smell of the place. He did not like that either.

In the next passage we find out that Summer knew Jon got away.  The fact that Bran thinks about Jon so much is another indication of Bran’s humanity and his empathy.  This is a contrast to the show.  Unfortunately, with film you cannot portray a character’s inner thoughts like you can with print.  Moving on, we then learn that in saving Jon, Summer was gravely injured.  We learn a bit about the bond here.  The pain Summer feels is so strong that Bran cannot even maintain or reestablish their connection.  He is relegated to praying for Summer’s safety, throwing in a prayer for Jon Snow.    Fortunately, Summer returns and they are able to dress his wounds which heal.  Bran considers his prayers answered.

&gt;The gate the Nightfort guarded had been sealed since the day the black brothers had loaded up their mules and garrons and departed for Deep Lake; its iron portcullis lowered, the chains that raised it carried off, the tunnel packed with stone and rubble all frozen together until they were as impenetrable as the Wall itself. “We should have followed Jon,” Bran said when he saw it. **He thought of his bastard brother often, since the night that Summer had watched him ride off through the storm**. “We should have found the kingsroad and gone to Castle Black.”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;“But there are wildlings. They killed some man and they wanted to kill Jon too. Jojen, there were a hundred of them.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“So you said. We are four. You helped your brother, if that was him in truth, but **it almost cost you Summer.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;“I know,” said Bran miserably. The direwolf had killed three of them, maybe more, but there had been too many. When they formed a tight ring around the tall earless man, **he had tried to slip away through the rain, but one of their arrows had come flashing after him, and the sudden stab of pain had driven Bran out of the wolf’s skin** and back into his own. After the storm finally died, they had huddled in the dark without a fire, talking in whispers if they talked at all, listening to Hodor’s heavy breathing and wondering if the wildlings might try and cross the lake in the morning. Bran had reached out for Summer time and time again, but the pain he found drove him back, the way a red-hot kettle makes you pull your hand back even when you mean to grab it. Only Hodor slept that night, muttering “Hodor, hodor,” as he tossed and turned. Bran was terrified that Summer was off dying in the darkness. Please, you old gods, he prayed, you took Winterfell, and my father, and my legs, **please don’t take Summer too**. **And watch over Jon Snow too**, and make the wildlings go away.  
&gt;  
&gt;No weirwoods grew on that stony island in the lake, yet somehow the old gods must have heard. The wildlings took their sweet time about departing the next morning, stripping the bodies of their dead and the old man they’d killed, even pulling a few fish from the lake, and there was a scary moment when three of them found the causeway and started to walk out . . . but the path turned and they didn’t, and two of them nearly drowned before the others pulled them out. The tall bald man yelled at them, his words echoing across the water in some tongue that even Jojen did not know, and a little while later they gathered up their shields and spears and marched off north by east, the same way Jon had gone. Bran wanted to leave too, to look for Summer, but the Reeds said no. “We will stay another night,” said Jojen, “put some leagues between us and the wildlings. You don’t want to meet them again, do you?” Late that afternoon Summer returned from wherever he’d been hiding, dragging his back leg. He ate parts of the bodies in the inn, driving off the crows, then swam out to the island. Meera had drawn the broken arrow from his leg and rubbed the wound with the juice of some plants she found growing around the base of the tower. **The direwolf was still limping, but a little less each day, it seemed to Bran. The gods had heard**.

The next passages are more examples of shadowing and hunting and mirroring.  Bran continues to be afraid of the characters from Old Nan’s stories; and Summer continues to be on guard.

&gt;So they went exploring, Jojen Reed leading, Bran in his basket on Hodor’s back, Summer padding by their side. Once the **direwolf bolted through a dark door and returned a moment later with a grey rat** between his teeth. The Rat Cook, Bran thought, but it was the wrong color, and only as big as a cat. The Rat Cook was white, and almost as huge as a sow . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;They spent half the day poking through the castle. Some of the towers had fallen down and others looked unsafe, but they climbed the bell tower (the bells were gone) and the rookery (the birds were gone). Beneath the brewhouse they found a vault of huge oaken casks that boomed hollowly when Hodor knocked on them. They found a library (the shelves and bins had collapsed, the books were gone, and rats were everywhere). They found a dank and dim-lit dungeon with cells enough to hold five hundred captives, but when Bran grabbed hold of one of the rusted bars it broke off in his hand. Only one crumbling wall remained of the great hall, the bathhouse seemed to be sinking into the ground, and a huge thornbush had conquered the practice yard outside the armory where black brothers had once labored with spear and shield and sword. The armory and the forge still stood, however, though cobwebs, rats, and dust had taken the places of blades, bellows, and anvil. Sometimes Summer would hear sounds that Bran seemed deaf to, or bare his teeth at nothing, the fur on the back of his neck bristling . . . but the Rat Cook never put in an appearance, nor the seventy-nine sentinels, nor Mad Axe. Bran was much relieved. Maybe it is only a ruined empty castle.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[…\]  
&gt;  
&gt;She laughed, and sent Hodor out to gather wood. Summer went too. It was almost dark by then, and the **direwolf wanted to hunt**.",asoiaf,"The Direwolves of Winterfell: Part 4, Summer and Bran’s Bond - Volume 3 - A Storm of Swords – Summer and The Winged Wolf – Unchained (Spoilers Extended)"
150,"What sort of man can stand by idly and watch his own brother being burned alive?

Caught this line in one of Jon’s POV chapters in ADWD. I’m wondering if this could be foreshadowing for Jon, Daenerys, and Aegon VI/Young Griff?

153,"In *A Dance With Dragons*, Bran had a vision of

&gt;a brown-haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor.

This is often guessed to be a vision of Dunk and Nan, who met during the next Dunk&amp;Egg story, working title: *The She-Wolves of Winterfell.* I will refer to this story as D&amp;E 4.

Assuming this is true, it has a couple of implications:

**Old Nan is (really) old**

D&amp;E 4 cannot take place too long after *The Mystery Knight*, which took place in 212 AC. By GRRM comments (source: [https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1408/](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1408/)), D&amp;E 4 takes place as a lord of Winterfell is dying from wounds he suffered while fighting the ironborn, and his wife and other Stark widows are struggling for power. At the time of The Mystery Knight, Lord Beron Stark is already gathering swords to fight the ironborn. This is partially guesswork, but it seems likely that to be Dunk's love interest, Nan has to have been at least as old as Egg. If Nan is as old as Egg, she is born in 200 AC, only two years after Maester Aemon, and a hundred years old as of ADWD.

**Nan is (most likely) lying about when and why she came to Winterfell**

Back in *Game of Thrones,* Bran thinks

&gt;Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark  whose mother had died birthing him. He had been an older brother of Lord Rickard, Bran's grandfather, or perhaps a younger brother, or a brother to Lord Rickard's father. Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another. In all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children.

*A World of Ice and Fire* gives a Brandon Stark as a son of William Stark, and consequently Beron Stark's grandson.  Since William's mother was one of the ""She-Wolves"" struggling for power, it seems unlikely that William would be old enough to father children already. Additionally, if Nan was lactating and already had given birth a child by the time Dunk and Egg came to Winterfell, that makes her age estimate even higher.

If Dany and Jon fall in love in the books, but Dany starts to go the route of Tyrant and threatens Jon's Stark family, that could be the beginning of their end.

Which of course leaves open the possibility of George's original intention; a romance between Jon and Arya.

# An interpretation of the colors

**Blue (Wights)**: the Ice in ASOIAF, emptiness, death

**Red**: the Fire in ASOIAF, a force that can battle death. The weirwoods stand against the Others, but Ghost (Jon’s avatar) has more mentions because Jon will play a more important role in the fight..

**Blue (Tullys):** dutiful and honorable, as said in the Tully words

**Green**: greed, but it goes beyond that to power-lust and recklessness (green like wildfire). Cersei with so many mentions is afflicted the most. Tywin is tempered by the gold, so he is both more cunning and more balanced.

**Gold**: intelligence, cunning. Strongest in Summer, showing Bran’s high intelligence. 

**Purple**: royalty, power. Lilac is fainter so it’s the weak copy.

**Pale/Colorless**: unfeeling, remorseless. Ilyn and Roose are unfeeling in the sociopathic vein, but Samwell maybe because of abuse suffered in childhood.

**Grey / Dark / Black**: stubborn, strongly devoted to a single cause

**Black (alternate meaning):** cruel, unforgiving, without warmth (blackness has no light). Ser Alliser, Bronn, and the Dothraki lean this way heavily with several mentions each. Mirri Maz Duur is close behind.

**White**: purity, goodness

**Mismatched Green/Black**: Tyrion is torn between desire for acceptance as a Lannister and desire for revenge on members of his family who wronged him

**Grey-green**: mercurial and unpredictable, while also stubborn and lusting for power

**Blue-Grey**: a literal foreshadowing of Benjen becoming half-Wight and half-Stark

**Pink**: ?

Undoubtedly the most famous word for ASOIAF and GoT was “Winter is coming”. It is a fact that it has a very strong timbre. From the very beginning, I had interpreted this famous word of the Starks as a warning that the Others came again.

**If this interpretation is completely correct, we see a picture like this.**

In the First Long Night, stories are told that the Others were pushed back beyond the north with the alliance of the Night's Watch / First Men+ Last Hero and Children. However, if we pay attention, we are apparently far from talking about victory in a real sense, moreover, even if the Starks have said the word ""Winter is Coming"" since then, we see that it is not a victory from the eyes of the Starks they know that the Others will return in such a way.

If you pay attention, I used the word “they know” instead of saying they think because they have used this sentence as a family word for 5000 years and wanted to make sure that everyone will hear and remember it. I guess they wouldn't try such a deep-rooted action on a mere guess? In this case, did the war with Others inevitably come to an end, through the ""agreement"" as some readers claim? I wonder. Because there is nothing in the name of victory, there is only a postponed event, and since the Stark knows it very well, he said, ""Winter is coming,"" and he pointed to the future.

They even said “Winter is Coming” instead of “Winter will come”. In other words, they speak of an event that has been coming from the very beginning, and has entered this process. I think this is an important detail.

**Apart from the above interpretation, a different possible interpretation has recently come to in my mind.**

I'm not sure, but I may have seen it here before.

*What if the famous ""Winter is Coming"" saying of the Stark is not just a warning but a threat?*

Yes, we know the legends, but legends and fairy tales are not 100% true, we know that too. One of the first official statements made by HBO for the Long Night / Blood Moon series is that the stories are not entirely correct; reveals that we will not encounter a story as we thought.

 

&gt;“Taking place thousands of years before the events of ‘Game of Thrones,’ the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’s history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East, to the Starks of legend … **it’s not the story we think we know.** ”

For example; It is told that the Long Night took place before Valyria 8 or 6 thousand years ago and Valyria's famous swords were not in the middle at that time. However, according to the statement (GRRM) Long Night, as we can see in the book when Valyria was founded during the first time of ""crawling"". As far as we can see in the book, the Last Hero killed the other with ""dragon steel"". In other words, even if we read the book carefully, the official history described reveals that it is not really reliable.

Lets continue.

&gt; *The hour of the wolf*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Ice.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Winter Is Coming.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Winter Kings.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.*

&amp;#x200B;

***Ice.*** We do not know exactly why the starks call the famous family heritage sword Ice, there are many comments on it. This name is so important to them that even if the real Ice disappears in some way (?), The 300-400-year-old Valyria sword has been given the name Ice, so the name is very important. 

One of the comments that is thought to cause the sword to be called “ice” is the connection of the Stark with the Others, that is, in essence with the Winter. True or not, it is discussed and this discussion does not end until the books is published. It is also thought-provoking that a family whose many things are called ""winter"" will call it ""ice"" for its sword. (The Others' swords are ice too.)  

It should also not be forgotten the fact that the agreement between Targ and Stark during the Dance is the Pact of Ice and Fire, and that the side of the Stark is represented as ""ice"".

***There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.*** Why? Probably one of the most mysterious sentences of the series; Maybe it is just a simple word that simply states that Winterfell belongs to that household and that a Stark must be have it. I would be inclined to think like that, if it was another household, but when I have a house with magic and mysterious roots, I put this comment on the second rank, although not counting it, and I think it should be another job under the job.

After all, Winterfell (possibly) enchanted with spells; surrounded by the roots of the Weirwood; we are talking about a place where the Stark / Winter Kings, who are believed to be imprisoned in their graves, with an iron sword so that their angry spirits do not take revenge in the underground cellars. What are you revenge for? Isn't this a question to be asked? Remember, GRRM defines ice as Revenge.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North. 

Undoubtedly, at least when there is no Stark in Winterfell, it is evident that the order in the North has deteriorated and even the roads have become dangerous. Because the Starks always provide complete domination and security in the North; so much so that a virgin on the King's road walks in a name-day dress and no one can touch her… It is not possible to say the same things for the southern kingdoms; neither in peace nor in war. To sum up, in order for the Northern people to be safe, a Stark must have been ruling in Winterfell, and no one else.

***Winter is coming. Winter kings.*** It is a correct claim to think that the word ""winter is coming"" and ""winter kings"" of the Stark is related to this household, and that it emphasizes its root. They are winter people. 

In this book, every family has a sigil. Lions, deer, fish ... But they are not real lions, fish or deer. But the Starks are truly a wolf, and the Targaryens are a true dragon. Wolf and dragon blood flow in their veins and they can rule these two animals.

 **The hour of the wolf .**  The Wolf Hour tells the story of Lord Cragen Stark's King Hand. His reign was very brief but very influential.

Wolf hour is also a time period. For example; Jon asks Edd in the 5th book to wake him up at the Wolf Hour. So, what does this hour mean during the day?

It corresponds to the DARKEST and LONGEST time zone of the day, namely the time before DAWN.

The darkest and longest hour of the day is referred to as ""the time of the wolf"". The expression of DARKEST and LONGEST moment inevitably reminds us of Long Night. So Winter.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  *It was the hour of the wolf. The longest, darkest hour of the night.  -Selmy, Winds Of Winter*

If I have established the connection correctly, the real time for the Wolves is when winter comes. This explains why the Starks called themselves Winter Kings, because the Starks' true reign time in winter.

Before winter, bad things happened to the Stark family. Winter is almost coming. When they return to their home again, they will take revenge on anyone who has gone wrong with them.

The following words help to get to know the Starks and the winter period a little more. Ned reminds Arya of her family word and what her coat of arms is; Winter is Coming, Direwolf. Wolves are identified as creatures that can survive the winter at all times, provided that they are together. Winter Town is already packed to the brim when winter comes, so its name is Winter Town; people gather together when winter comes. Also, it should not be overlooked that they are trying to be closer to the Starks, this town is very close to Winterfell. Because the Starks will protect them.

&gt;""You are too young to be burdened with all my cares,"" he told her, ""but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""**Winter** is **coming**,"" Arya whispered.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The hard cruel times,"" her father said. ""We tasted them on the Trident, child, and when Bran fell. You were born in the long summer, sweet one, you've never known anything else, but now the winter is truly coming. Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.""  
&gt;  
&gt; ""The direwolf,"" she said, thinking of Nymeria. She hugged her knees against her chest, suddenly afraid.   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm...""

Winter and Snow are described as ""death"" in this series. The only thing that the two bring is ""death"". Cregan Stark even planned to punish Storm's End, Castery Rock and Oldtown for supporting the 2nd Aegon during the war period, this was his intention when he went south with his army, but he couldn't when the 2nd Aegon died. Because, according to him, these households had did wrong and he had to be punished with death. (It was winter time.)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But behind them came a greater army of childless and homeless men, unwed men, old men, and younger sons, under the banner of Lord Cregan Stark. They had come for a war, for adventure and plunder, and for a glorious death to spare their kin beyond the Neck one more mouth to feed. The poisoning of King Aegon II had denied them that chance. Lord Stark still marched his army into King’s Landing, but to a much different outcome. He had planned to punish Storm’s End, Oldtown, and Casterly Rock for having supported the king 

Now, the Stark family is hostile to many families, especially Castery Rock. Many people made it wrong against the Starks and brought them to the level of extinction, took what belongs to them, but as Jojen Reed said, ""The wolves will turn.""

Do you think this is just a good news that they will return to Winterfell? I do not think so. This is also a warning / threat to enemies because I think that when they come back, things will happen to their enemies. The name of the last book was A Time for Wolves, although it changed later. So it is appropriate to translate it as the Hour of the Wolves / Time of the Wolves. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Another issue is actually in the name of Winterfell. Winter-fell

As you know, my English is not good, so maybe it is not right to comment on this subject.  However, I think you can help with this.

Winterfell is a name, true. So it sounds like it is about the end of winter. But what if it's actually a name that tells us it's winter is coming?  Do not you use also the word ""fall"" in English to mean ""come""? Something similar to it at least.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Winter is coming, and when the **Long** **Night** **falls**, only the Night’s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north. The gods help us all if we are not ready.""

When the Long Night falls... so when it comes ... It is also possible to refer to it as the place where Winterfell come in the winter, especially if it is a place where a family called themselves Winter Kings and Winter Wolves and described as ""ice"".

If all is true ... Winter is Coming, not only a warning, but a threat.

*“Winter is Coming and we Starks are coming too; The wolves reign in the darkest period / winter, and we are the Stark, Winter Kings, winter is our time/reign. ”*

How about you? Could this statement really be a threat as much as a warning?

175,"So after the death of Robb Stark at the Red Wedding we know of 4 Generals in Robb's camp who were either captured or didn't go to the twins due to Robb sending them on a mission. I am of course talking about Great Jon Umber (Captured), Harrion Karstark (Captured), Galbart Glover (Sent to Get Howland Reed) and Maege Mormont (Also sent to Get Howland Reed). So the question is what will be the fates of the 4 Generals of Robb Stark.

Firstly, I will start with Great Jon Umber - a great and loyal Lord of House Stark who will want revenge no matter the cost and because of this will likely be executed before House Stark reclaim the Northern Kingdom and get revenge after the events of the Red Wedding. As a captive of House Frey when things collapse in the North for House Bolton and with enemies all around them I cannot see them letting The Great Jon go or bargaining him off either due to their future predicament. This only leaves one outcome the Great Jon's death which I hope he does try to escape and kills a few Freys trying.

Secondly, Harrion Karstark - the actual Lord of Karhold who is held captive at Maidenpool and with some of the Karstarks trying to make sure he gets executed by actively playing their own Game of Thrones for Karhold. I do believe Harrion will be rescued but unsure of who and with Faegon Targaryen taking the Stormlands and the uncertainty of the other Kingdoms he would be able to be rescued more easily than the Great Umber at the Twins. I believe he will get rescued and find out House Stark have reclaimed the North, travel north to take his place as Lord of Karhold whilst finding our which Stark survived and reclaimed the North.

Finally, Galbart Glover and Maege Mormont who were sent into the neck to find Lord Reed and before the events of the Red Wedding so their location is somewhere in the neck. It wouldn't surprise me if Lord Reeds men find Glover/Mormont's entourage before they do and take them to Greywater Watch. I would believe Howland knows what has been happening in the North and will likely keep Galbart and Maege until House Stark retake the North in order to keep them from being executed by Bolton forces who knows how loyal they were not only to Robb but House Stark.

176,"I posted the gist of this in a comment a little while ago, but I was curious what people thought. The main point is that the only force that compels Robb to lose the war is plot, not his own bad decisions or his mothers (though neither of those helped) but neither screwed him like some of the nonsense I list below did. 
.

Let’s consider his first act when he is forced to negotiate for a crossing with Walder Frey because the river is running fast and high and he can’t make a crossing.

This is some grade A fucking bullshit right off the bat, there has been a 10 year long summer and no rains during Robbs gathering of his men and journey south, and yet the river is running fast and high at nearly its highest point upstream? Bullshit.

Second off, Westeros is a feudal society and has some clear technological advantages over medieval Europe, who had in abundance the ability to quickly block the flow of water or build a  bridge across a river. That technology is as old as ancient Persia, and common in Rome. The only reason Robb is forced to negotiate with the freys and make such a poor deal is the power of plot, which is robbs entire story really.

The events between this and theon taking winterfell, I am inclined to believe are simply unfortunate events and poor choices by an inexperienced commander, and unlikely but not impossible decisions by Balon, Ser Rodrick and others. It’s what follows that truly boggles the mind.

Ser rodrick returns to winterfell, so slowly from Torrhen’s square that somehow theon is able to take the castle, arrange to meet with his sister who rides all the way from deep wood motte (almost twice the distance), send Ramsay to the dread fort (the same distance away as torrhens square) and for Ramsay to return with men. Here we witness some more grade A bullshit.  There is no reason in hell, it should take Ser rodrick this long to get back to winterfell, there is no reason in hell the manderlys don’t bring men north to winterfell, or lady Dustin for that matter, given she was not involved in the red wedding and hates the ironborn as much as anyone else.

There is also no reason the mountain clans just sit there either, especially given the loyalty they proclaim to Ned later on. After winterfell fell, and theon burned the millers boys he should have lost it back in like a day tops. His sister should have barely left by the time he was attacked and destroyed.

Also, Ramsay should never have known to save the freys and sack winterfell. The timing is even more insane if we consider he had to get a letter to his father and back before he marched. He shouldn’t even know his father holds harrenhal tbh, but if he did somehow know, he still should not have been able to take advantage of this situation so deftly.

This brings me to my next point, Robb Stark somehow is completely cut off from contacting all his bannerman still in the north. He doesn’t send a raven to lady Dustin, or the umbers who still have 2k men, or white harbor, or fucking Skagos or have someone talk the flints and wills. Somehow he can’t get a single message to anyone in the north, and the ironborn just roam free. It’s possible that this is Incompetence, but given his other behaviors is strikes me more as plot holes. This happens while controlling ports like the one Arya used to get to braavos. 

TLDR: Robb got done dirty.",asoiaf,[SPOILERS EXTENDED] Robb shouldn’t have lost the war if not for plot holes.

They didn't want to make more seasons, fine 
They wanted to move on from that show and they compromised with the quality, also fine. It's their show,their responsibility. 

but what's NOT FINE is that, whilst taking shortcuts, they didn't deter from the book ending.

So it seems  like their reasoning went something like this.
-OK we don't want to do this anymore. Let's just round it up by telling everyone how it ends.

 They spoiled the ending of  something that people (me) have invested 150+ hours of reading, into. (I just guess 150+ because I've read them twice, and they have such depth that it would be justifiable to read them yet another 2 times.)

How is not George rr Martin pissed? How haven't he commentated on the fact that he told them the ending to his books, and they told everyone! They spoiled important parts of his ending every fan he has.
Isn't he offended somehow? It would be different if they told his story, but they wouldn't be bothered, they just cut corners and told us how it was going to end, add some poor actionscenes and then piss off.

Isn't that infringing on his integrity as an artist in some way? Have he commented on this at all? I havent found any statements from him, other than nonsense were he pretends like nothing, saying generic stuff on his blog like, it's been a journey, I can't belive it's over bla bla bla. (now I understand how sandor feel when he hears sansa.) 

If they did indeed spoil his ending, then they buggered him over.
And then they also buggered all the fans over, because all they've been saying all along is that the TV show will diverge from the books, they show has gone ahead of the books, doing its own thing now.
Just so that you will let your gard down, to think that it's safe to see the show, even though it's been shit the last seasons,  because it's not like it will spoil anything! Right! It's harmless! 

Bam then they hit you with huge spoilers without any spoiler alert. 

Tldr: the show probably robbed a lot of people of the joy that would come with learning about the ending when it's being delivered through the amazing storytelling of George rr Martin.
I will throughly enjoy the books to come. But key aspects of what's to come have already been delivered and consumed in a dissatisfactory, unnecessary manner.

196,"First, the oath itself:

&gt; ""To Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater. Hearth and harvest and we yield up to you, my lord. Our swords and spears and arrows are yours to command. Grant mercy to our weak, help to our helpless, and justice to all, and we shall never fail you."" — Both
&gt; 
&gt; **""I swear it by earth and water.""** — Jojen
&gt; 
&gt; **""I swear it by bronze and iron.""** — Meera
&gt; 
&gt; **""We swear it by ice and fire.""** — Both

I believe this oath, especially the latter part, is the key to understanding the backdrop of the story, including magic and the Children of the Forest, as well as the Others and Dragons

Meera and Jojen each say one line individually: interestingly enough, the lines they say represent either side of the war that occurred between the Singers of Westeros and the invading Humans: the CotF used magics involving earth (Weirwoods, warging, maybe even obsidian and the black stones?) and water (arm of Dorne anyone? Perhaps the Deep Ones as well?) whereas the humans used weapons of bronze first, then iron.

Then, the two finish in what I believe is a very significant line, and one that implies mutual destruction: Ice (Starks, the Others) and Fire (Valyrians, Dragons)

I think this juxtaposition even gives clues as to why the Others have returned. After all, the twins are surprised Bran doesn't know this oath, and it seems deeply related to the war with the CotF just as Bran's story is. I think the Reed twins were aware the Others were coming and expected Bran to be as well--because I think one of Rhaegar's confidants (Arthur) told Ned and Howland about the prophecy and poor Ned forgot this detail due to trauma.

So if we assume the oath is directly related to that war and to magic as well, then we get a hint about the reason for the Other's returning which may be one of the following:

1. They are returning because Illyrio set in motion the events that would lead to the resurrection of dragons (this leads into another theory I have that the Death of Dragons is a tome detailing a conspiracy created by the maesters in conjunction with the CotF as part of a contract to end the war against the Others)

2. The Children are ready to move against the humans again as they are dying out and Bran is born, so they are ready to send the Others to attack

3. The coming of the red comet signifies the coming of the long winter--a sign to summon dragons coincides with a sign to call forth their counterparts

There are also a bunch of other theories I have, like one that plays off of the theory that Azor Ahai is an ancient god trying to get himself resurrected and that the oath is the outline of a ritual.

But one of the more practical things that the oath tells us is the magic that is available in the world. Magic is viewed as a weapon, and the juxtaposition of 4 elements with the more obvious bronze and iron cements it.

I believe that everything magical in this world is related to one of the 4 elements laid out in the oath:

Earth - black stone, mazemaker mazes, weirwood shenanigans, warging, greyscale

Water - tsunamis, water magic in Essos, the Iron Born and the their origins, the Deep Ones/Drowned God, Patchface

Fire - Dragons, Valyrians, red-priest bullshit, Varys' poor balls, the Red Comet, glass candles, glamours (including those performed by the faceless men), resurrections, maybe the black weirwood juice

Ice - the Others, the Starks and their aversion to cold. This might also have to do with warging, or perhaps more magic will come in the future that is obviously tied to the Starks. 

Anyway, it's a bit ramble-y but I feel that a lot of theories ignore what the oath brings to the table and what it implies about Rhaegar, Howland, and Ned; as well as the knowledge both Jojen and Meera have and expected Bran to have.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) The Reed oath to Bran is terribly under-discussed
197,"We all know that there is going to be a second dance of dragons between Dany and FAegon. But what if it's actually between Jon and FAegon, after Dany's death at the hands of FAegon. The true Dragon vs the Mummer's dragon. I think Tyrion would change sides again and align with FAegon, who by the time Dany comes to Westeros, is on the iron throne and ruling peacefully. He would be much loved by the people after suffering from Cersei, and they see Dany as an invader. Dany would help Jon and the North to defeat the wights first and then goes to KL to defeat FAegon. The Dorne would align with FAegon and some other major houses would support him. Tyrion knows all the weaknesses of Dragons and he cleverly sets the trap to kill Dany and her Dragons. Jon would be devastated by his lover's death, and tries to go against Tyrion and FAegon marching the North. 

Also, I think FAegon is really the Aegon. The son of Rhaegar and Elia. Remember, Grrm sometimes drops subtle clues when he's talking. He keeps referring FAegon as AegonVI, So I think he might be really the true Aegon. 

The truth of his heritage would be revealed too late and only after Jon kills FAegon by his hand, it's revealed that he is indeed the son of Rhaegar. This would make Jon both a kinslayer and kingslayer. He would self exiles himself leaving Bran as King.",asoiaf,(SPOILERS EXTENDED) Jon Vs AegonVI
198,"I just finished reading TWOIAF, Dunk&amp;Egg and Fire&amp;Blood. Now I’m ready for a reread of the main series! I only read it once years ago, then I saw the show (hate the final btw) and at that point I resumed reading with TWOIAF.

I love reading theories, and with this rereading I would like to pay as much attention to detail and foreshadowing as possible so...


What are the things, the dialogues, the characters, the dreams, etc. to which I should pay particular attention so as not to miss interesting details that could easily escape?",asoiaf,(Spoiler Extended) On the start of a reread!
199,"The first one is so evident which was to not go back on his word to marry one of Walder Frey's daughter which led to his murder at the Red Wedding. But for me it was a few things that he could have done the first one would have been to bend the knee to Stannis after Renly was murdered this way he could save face and could even have said he did it to honour his father as it was Ned who knew Stannis was the rightful King. By having Stannis onboard with him he would have had an experienced commander who could see deceit and betrayal a mile off especially with Roose Bolton. 

Although Robb won a few battles it was his decisions which cost him his life and thousands others which could have been prevented. Secondly, listening to his generals a little more instead of his mother especially when she let Jaime go to try and trade him for her daughters that cut Robb's legs off from behind.

Maybe instead of sending his mother to the Eyrie he should have gone himself, I am not saying Lysa would have consented with siding with the Starks/Tullys her own kin as she was a pawn in Little Fingers games. However some other House's could have sided on their own terms with Robb and thus giving him more experience and men he needed.

The Ironborn Invasion which was catastrophic as there was nothing Robb could do except turn back sooner to save the North before trying a suicidal attempt of taking Casterly Rock after Edmure's wedding. Him showing that the North was more important than revenge which could have helped distinguish the betrayals coming his way would have helped him. He could have taken care of the Ironborn and regrouped, restrategised and had more time with the Lords of the North about what step to take next whether it be try ally with someone. 

Jaime Lannister situation - Although Robb was right he should have made Tywin come direct to him for an exchange of the Stark girls and if he didn't hear back from him at a time point then Jaime would be executed. This would work well as actions speak louder than words for Tywin especially as he would do literally anything to make sure Jaime wouldn't die. And as far as Robb knew to save the girls he would have to get them out of Kings Landing or Take it which would be impossible without allies making Sansa/Arya survival very slim. 

Obviously sending Theon away to his father was a disaster waiting to happen especially as Theon didn't fit in with the Starks with being a Greyjoy and vice versa - Robb was warned and it started the domino effect that led to his downfall. 

What other things could Robb have done differently?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) What could Robb Stark have done differently?
202,"About possibility of rape Meera by Bran while warged in Hodor. Unknowingly he already broke two of the three warging rules, eat human flesh and warged into human. Third is you don't do nasty things while warged.

207,"Tywin Lannister has lost my respect. (Getting this off my chest)

Like the majority of this fandom, I used to have tremendous respect and admiration for Tywin. He was a intelligent, Ruthless, and commanded respect from all those around him and through sheer will made House Lannister is strongest house on the continent. He clearly was not evil, as shown through his disdain for his grandson, Joffrey. But he was cruel, and his treatment of Tyrion was not only his worst quality but eventually his downfall. However, after learning that He and his late wife Joanna are cousins, my opinion of Tywin has done a complete 180. The ramifications of incest is a prevalent theme throughout the novels, and this is most likely the reason Tyrion is a dwarf in the first place. Not only that, this could also be the reason for Cercei’s ASPD, which only manifested much worse through her son, Joffrey, also born of incest. Tywin acts as if his children’s shortcomings are no fault of his, when in reality it’s all his fault. King Jaehaerys said that every time a Targaryen was born, the gods flipped a coin: madness or greatness. From the day Tywin layed with his cousin, the gods flipped coins for each of his descendants, and he ended up treating the only son worthy of being his heir as a monster, while the real monsters followed in his footsteps and bred a Mad King of their own.",asoiaf,Tywin Lannister is a fool.
210,"When the Vale and Dorne basically act neutral during the war of the Five Kings, aren't they committing treason? Shouldn't all loyal areas of the kingdom send aid to King's Landing? I can understand that the Lannisters can't force the Vale and Dorne to send troops because they are busy fighting a war, but you'd think that they would at least verbally demand that the Vale and Dorne help them. But I can't remember anywhere in the books where it talks about the Lannisters being angry at the Vale or Dorne for not sending troops. You'd think the Lannisters would be talking about punishing the Vale and Dorne after the war is over, but I can't remember them ever doing that.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Published] The Vale and Dorne during the War of the Five Kings.
211,"So I think we're all in agreement that Dany's ""besiege the city because being killed in battle is somehow worse than dying of starvation"" plan is extremely wack. However, I disagree with the fandom's idea that she'll somehow ""accidentally"" burn the city while invading it.  
I think that she'll actually be successful at taking the city; her ultimate failure will be trying to hold it. 

We've already seen in ADWD how bad she is at ruling cities, and we've seen in ACOK that King's Landing in particular is an absolute nightmare to control during war. In all likelihood, Dany will completely fail at keeping peace, and all her efforts to make things right will just cause more chaos. Despite her efforts to present herself as a messiah, the smallfolk will always see her as the Mad King's daughter as well as a foreign invader, and they'll treat her accordingly. Dany will also inherit the Iron Throne's outlandish debts, so the Iron Bank's constant pestering will force her to raise taxes, which will obviously make her even more unpopular. Oh yeah, and if the Tyrells side with fAegon, then the Roseroad will be blocked again, causing mass starvation, which was what caused the riot in ACOK. And the inevitable violence will cause the strange foreign eunuchs to constantly poke around in everyone's business, which will just make everyone even more angry... it's all a recipe for disaster.

But wait, haven't we seen all of this before? I believe that Dany's downfall will strongly mirror the downfall of Queen Rhaenyra during the Dance of the Dragons. As anyone who read Fire &amp; Blood will know, the final nail in the coffin for Rhaenyra's rule was the Storming of the Dragonpit, where a radical religious group led the peasants of King's Landing into the Dragonpit to violently massacre five of Rhaenyra's dragons. 

And as it happens, King's Landing is currently controlled by a radical religious group...

Yeah, I think that at least one of Dany's dragons will die in the same way that Rhaenyra's did. Who better to inflame the mobs than a foreign queen with a foreign army and three foreign dragons? The smallfolk can't be assed to sit and starve through another devastating war, so they'll instead take their lead from the Faith Militant and march up Rhaenys' hill (or wherever Dany puts them), once again taking their frustration out on the unnatural beasts that the gods smited 600 years ago. Dany's dragons won't be killed by the Others, nor by fAegon, but by the very people that she was trying to protect.

And *that* will be what causes Dany to go insane in the end (rather than the sound of bells lol). She will at last understand that the people of Westeros will never love her no matter how hard she tries, so the next best thing is for them to fear her.",asoiaf,(spoilers extended) The sad potential fate of Dany's dragons.
212,"I've been thinking about this for a while now, we know George wasn't a big fan of what the show became, saying how it and the books are two different stories from a certain point onwards, so when D&amp;D asked him how his books would end, do you think it's possible that he also fed them some false information?

Maybe he lied about a character living so he could kill him/her himself, or modified a few details or motivations to distance them from the path he intends to follow. He went on record saying his stories change as he's writing them, with him having a ""gardener"" type of aproach to them. 

This could just be me telling myself again that ""the books will be different"", but frankly, the only thing that the show spoiled for me is Bran as king, and knowing George, that could have a darker twist to it as well...",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) Could GRRM have lied to D&amp;D ?
213,"Much has been discussed regarding Quaithe and her so called prophecies &amp; warnings to Daenerys. Most of us assume given her background as an Asshaii that she must be legitimate in her powers of sight and astral projection. Is it possible that Dany has hallucinated her ""visions"" of Quaithe? Or mayhaps Quaithe can astral project but her ""prophecies"" are just generic cold readings? I wonder this because for years I have tried to determine the meanings behind them. Stuff like the Suns Son and the Pale mare seemed obvious. But many readers including Dany herself wondered who the ""perfumed seneschal"" is. I've seen theories its Varys, Garth Tyrell the steward of Highgarden, Reznak Mo Reznak, Archmaester Theobald and even Tyrion or Moqorro for travelling on the ""Fragrant Steward"". There is a vast number of candidates and to me that makes me wonder if Martin did that on purpose. Think about it, it could be any one of those I listed and Quaithe wouldn't be wrong. For Christ's sake there's even a ship called the ""Fragrant Steward"". Each one of them is a completely different problem for Dany if they are what Quaithe warned about. So why be so vague? Why not just tell her beware of Reznak or beware a ship carrying a bunch of potential enemies? But she doesn't. Is Martin intentionally warning us as readers to not take stock in prophecies? That as we go through to be weary of which Prophecies we hold onto and which we should pay attention to? Or am I just looking too deep into this? Or maybe not deep enough?",asoiaf,Is Quaithe actually magical?

Later on Jorah Mormont asked for Lynesse’s hand in marriage and her father agreed. 

What could have made Leyton Hightower agree to Jorah Mormont’s proposal?

The Hightowers are an old family and as rich as the Lannisters. It seems mind boggling that Leyton Hightower agreed to the match when Bear Island is vastly different and would be a huge culture shock to Lynesse. Leyton Hightower should have know how high maintenance his daughter was. He would have realized that she would have grown miserable in Bear Island. 

Not to mention there was no strategic advantage to either parties (Its not like Oldtown wanted to start a Northern commerce on the west side. Bear Island is too far North with no good ports)

Could it be possible that Leyton Hightower agreed to the match because Jorah Mormont was the son of Jeor Mormont, the Lord Commander of the Night Watch? 

Maybe Leyton Hightower read about the coming of the Long Night and the threat of the Others and wanted to do his part to try to save humanity. 

Maybe he was setting up a plan where the Hightowers would help the Night Watch in the War for the Dawn. However, the plan fell apart when Jorah and Lynesse was sent into exile by Ned Stark.

Bear in mind that, yes, changing the past might butterfly effect so much that I never even got pushed out the tower and got all crippled, visited by the three-eyed crow, traveled north to hang with Bloodraven and become time traveling Bran in the first place, but just ignore that for now so we can have some fun.

My theory is that Ned found two babies in the Tower of Joy, Jon (whom in the books I think his real Targ name is Aemon Targaryen), and (F)Aegon (whom's real Targ name I think is Eddard Targaryen), Lyanna makes the promise to Ned to keep both of them safe, and Ned brings baby (F)Aegon to Starfall in hopes Ashara will take care of him and takes baby Jon back home with him north. Ashara has one of her hand maidens send the baby to Varys under the identity of Septa Lemore. 

What evidence I have for this is that in the show Jon is given the name of Aegon. Is it possible they merged some of Young Griff with Jon in the show? Also that it seems unlikely that (F)Aegon is a Blackfyre, I do believe that it's possible Varys could be Blackfyre and there is some sort of conspiracy but I don't think (F)Aegon himself is one, especially from a storytelling perspective it makes sense he would be a pawn in Varys conspiracy.  Another thing is that both Jon and (F)Aegon are central characters at the same age with very similar stories, with ambiguous backstories linked to Robert's Rebellion. Now some stuff are an issue, like the theory stats that Ashara is Septa Lemore, obviously I don't think this is the case, I do think Ashara faked her death, but I don't think she's Septa Lemore.

But, are there other alternate prologues and epilogues that GRRM could have written? Has he ever revealed that he planned something different or were the chosen prologues/epilogues set in stone? Are they too essential or could they be swapped out? 

Do you lose or gain something, for example, if you omit AGOT’s canon prologue and do something different instead? Say, a prologue from Jon Arryn’s perspective as he succumbs to the Tears of Lys? That way, we wouldn’t know if the Others were real until i they assault the Fist of the First Men in ASOS. 

Lady Stoneheart’s appearance in the epilogue of ASOS is George’s final mic-drop of that book. But would Catelyn Stark’s resurrection be more jaw-dropping if we first hear only the  stories of the “Hangwoman, Mother Merciless, Stoneheart” (as we do in Jaime’s Riverlands POV) until Brienne stumbles upon them and it is first revealed through her eyes that this outlaw is actually her resurrected Lady who she swore an oath to?

Alternate ideas include Balon Greyjoy’s “death” (theorized to be an assassination by a Faceless Man), one of the “seven deaths” of Beric Dondarrion (preferably his first, but I’m not sure if that happens too early in AGOT for it make sense as AGOT’s prologue or epilogue?). A prologue to introduce a part of the world we haven’t yet seen, such as how Pate introduces the world and characters of Oldtown?

239,"As yet another dribble of the sprawling Euron = Azor Ahai theory that I am definitely not putting off finishing, I swear, let's look at the Silence and how it provides some clues about Euron's true importance to the story: as the vessel of the Bloodstone Emperor Azor Ahai, the Doom of Man.

**Red Ships, Red Swords**

While the Azor Ahai prophecy hangs heavy over the entire narrative, and Euron seems like a new addition to the story in AFFC, in reality both of these figures are introduced at roughly the same time. Our first introduction to Azor Ahai occurs in Davos I, ACOK. In this first mention, our attention is drawn to Azor Ahai's red sword, Lightbringer.

&gt;""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. **In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes,** and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him."" She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. ""Azor Ahai, beloved of R'hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you! Come forth and take it into your hand!"" -Davos I, ACOK

The fact that Lightbringer is a Red Sword of Heroes is further highlighted by Sallador Saan's telling of its forging.

The next chapter in ACOK is Theon I, and here as he returns to the Iron Isles we receive our first hints about the character of Euron. In particular, Theon wants to make sure we are all very aware of what color Euron's ship is, well before we meet him.

&gt;Some of the sails bore devices from the other islands; the blood moon of Wynch, Lord Goodbrother's banded black warhorn, Harlaw's silver scythe. **Theon searched for his uncle Euron's Silence. Of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign,** but his father's Great Kraken was there, her bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake. -Theon I, ACOK

The Silence is described as red, lean and terrible. Slender as a sword, red and terrifying, much as a true sword of fire would be. In conjunction with this reveal, we also are given several symbols. The blood moon, which once lent its title to the now defunct GoT prequel. The moon notably features in the Azor Ahai legend, and there is some implication that Azor Ahai may have cracked it, resulting in astronomical catastrophe.

&gt;It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon... -Davos I, ACOK

We also see a banded black warhorn, evocative of the black horn Dragonbinder which Euron will later introduce into the narrative. Finally, a silver scythe. Which is less specific to Euron or Azor Ahai, but an ominous symbol of death all the same.

Could we gather something from the proximity of Euron and Azor Ahai's introductions? I think so. A common trope in film-making and TV writing, which GRRM of course did for a while, is the [Answer Cut.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnswerCut) Someone asks a question, then the camera cuts to the answer to that question. By placing these two characters in such close proximity, when there really is no chronological reason to do so (by [the best estimate,](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/84563-most-precise-asoiaf-timeline-in-existence/) there are 6 chapters occurring chronologically between Davos I and Theon I), GRRM is giving us a subtle literary version of an Answer Cut.

**Black Sails, Black Omens**

Besides the red hull, we also know that the Silence has black sails.

&gt;His Silence, with its **black sails** and dark red hull, was infamous in every port from Ibben to Asshai, it was said. -Theon II, ACOK

&gt;And then he saw her: a single-masted galley, lean and low, with a dark red hull. Her sails, now furled, were **black as a starless sky.** -The Iron Captain, AFFC

Red and black are the colors of the ASOIAF world's most famous (and infamous) family of dragonlords: the Targaryens. This family, with its three headed dragon sigil and association with TPTWP prophecy, seems intimately tied to the Azor Ahai prophecy, so it's ironic that a non-member is effectively flying their colors. 

More importantly, the black sail is purposefully compared to a starless sky. This is the sort of sky one would expect during the Long Night, with the stars concealed by supernatural haze. It also aligns quite well with the vision Daenerys sees during her AGOT fever dreams, of a great dragon covering the sky with its wings, and the world taking fire.

&gt;She saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea, the living plain, rich with the smells of earth and death. Wind stirred the grasses, and they rippled like water. Drogo held her in strong arms, and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone, and the stars smiled down on them, stars in a daylight sky. ""Home,"" she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but **suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame.** -Daenerys IX, AGOT

Azor Ahai is commonly considered the individual who ended the Long Night, but we have received several clues that he may have done the exact opposite. There is, of course, his origin in Asshai, a place where the Long Night never ended.

&gt;The nights are very black in Asshai, all agree, and even the brightest days of summer are somehow grey and gloomy. -TWOIAF

And there is the symbolic clue of his name, Azor Ahai. Probably inspired by the words ""Asura Ahi,"" Sanskrit for ""demon serpent."" Ahi, better known as [Vritra,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vritra) was an Asura (similar to a demon, although a bit more morally ambiguous) with a flaming weapon who among other terrible deeds blocked out the stars in the sky.

&gt;Like arrows released in the four directions, the demon's body grew, day after day. Tall and blackish, he appeared like a burnt hill and was as lustrous as a bright array of clouds in the evening. The hair on the demon's body and his beard and moustache were the color of melted copper, and his eyes were piercing like the midday sun. **He appeared unconquerable, as if holding the three worlds on the points of his blazing trident.** Dancing and shouting with a loud voice, he made the entire surface of the earth tremble as if from an earthquake. **As he yawned again and again, he seemed to be trying to swallow the whole sky with his mouth, which was as deep as a cave. He seemed to be licking up all the stars in the sky** with his tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth. Seeing this gigantic demon, everyone, in great fear, ran here and there in all directions.

By invoking the visual of starless skies, the black sails of the Silence tie Euron to the Asura Ahi, and the more negative interpretation of the AAR prophecy as one about the world's destroyer, not its savior.

**Silenced Song, Silenced Screams**

Besides coloration, there’s another distinctive attribute to Euron’s ship: the figurehead.

&gt;On her prow was a black iron maiden with one arm outstretched. Her waist was slender, her breasts high and proud, her legs long and shapely. A windblown mane of black iron hair streamed from her head, and her eyes were mother-of-pearl, but she had no mouth. -The Iron Captain, AFFC

The mouthless female figurehead comes up again in a different Victarion chapter, while Victarion contemplates matters of eternal fate.

&gt;A gang of sullen survivors moved amongst them, chasing off the black birds and tossing the dead into the back of a wagon for burial. The notion filled Victarion with disgust. No true son of the sea would want to rot beneath the ground. How would he ever find the Drowned God's watery halls, to drink and feast for all eternity?

&gt;The Silence was amongst the ships they passed. Victarion's gaze was drawn to the iron figurehead at her prow, the mouthless maiden with the windblown hair and outstretched arm. Her mother-of-pearl eyes seemed to follow him. She had a mouth like any other woman, till the Crow's Eye sewed it shut. -The Reaver, AFFC

Azor Ahai is known as the man who killed his beloved wife Nissa-Nissa, but the truth may in fact be far worse. 

&gt;”...her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel.” -Davos I, ACOK

There are [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cqrwpy/spoilers_extended_a_horrifying_theory_about_why/) to believe this talk of “souls in swords” is no metaphor, and that Valyrian Steel (which is ordinarily a dark smoky black) is made using human souls, manipulated through shadowbinding. It is quite possible Nissa-Nissa didn’t truly die, and that her soul was instead bound to the sword Lightbringer. This concept of being eternally “locked-in” was part of a very well known short sci-fi/horror story by [George RR Martin’s old friend](http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/06/30/another-sadness-2/) Harlan Ellison: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. In the story, which you can read [here,](https://wjccschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/I-Have-No-Mouth-But-I-Must-Scream-by-Harlan-Ellison.pdf) a rogue AI called AM wipes out most of humanity and attains godlike power, which it uses to torment the survivors forever. It gets worse from there.

&gt;I had thought AM hated me before. I was wrong. It was not even a shadow of the hate he now slavered from every printed circuit. He made certain I would suffer eternally and could not do myself in. He left my mind intact. I can dream, I can wonder, I can lament. 

Considering the influence of this short story, the mouthless black iron figurehead is a perfect symbol for the potential fate worse than death of Nissa-Nissa. Sealed in a form of black metal, aware yet unable to communicate her plight. 

Not only that, but the figurehead may also symbolize how Nissa-Nissa has been silenced in history. Much of world history entails the steady supplanting and erasure of pagan traditions featuring goddesses (nowadays reflected in the triple goddess of Mother-Maiden-Crone in Wicca and other neopagan religions) by the Abrahamic religions which are generally speaking much more patriarchal. In addition, [as pointed out by others](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/d6en5x/archeological_inspiration_spoilers_extended/) (in support of theories I don’t personally believe), in the 1980s much archaeological discussion surrounded emerging evidence that the god of the Israelites Yahweh at one point had a feminine consort, Asherah, but in the transition towards pure monotheism all veneration of Asherah was discarded and in many cases burned. The feminine was silenced by the masculine.

The silencing of Nissa-Nissa in the Azor Ahai legend may be part of the general comparison I believe GRRM is trying to make between the veneration of R’hllor and Azor Ahai, and Abrahamic monotheism, with its focus on bloody sacrifice, second comings, and a wrathful jealous god bearing a strong similarity to the Gnostic critique of the God of Abraham known as [Yaldabaoth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Yaldabaoth) After all, why is it Azor Ahai’s “noble sacrifice” to forge Lightbringer is the one people venerate when it was Nissa-Nissa who paid the ultimate price? Why is Nissa-Nissa reduced to a largely mute supporting character in the drama of Azor Ahai when she is the one who supposedly martyred herself to save the world?

**Conclusion**

Do I believe Azor Ahai designed Euron’s ship? Of course not. All of the supporting Greyjoy characters remember this ship’s distinct appearance well before Euron’s return from the Smoking Sea. And I doubt even a villainous interpretation of Azor Ahai is going to be so unremittingly rotten as to gloat about how he damned his wife to eternal suffering by commissioning a figurehead representing the fact. GRRM probably wants him to be a more complex figure than that. But I think GRRM designed the ship as a sinister clue to the true identity and purpose of Azor Ahai reborn: to bring silence to the song of ice and fire. The last storm. The breaking and remaking of the world.",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Extended) Red Ship of ""Heroes"": Is the Silence Another Clue That Euron Greyjoy is Azor Ahai Reborn?"

246,"So for some reason I've been thinking about everybody's (least) favorite fuckboy a lot: Daario Naharis. And one thing I just can't get over is how stupid he looks. This is from the wiki:

&gt;Daario is lithe and smooth skinned with bright, deep blue eyes which can appear almost purple. His curly hair reaches his collar, and he keeps his beard cut in three prongs. Daario dyes his hair and trident beard, sometimes in blue and other times in deep purple. His fingernails are also enameled blue. Daario's mustachios are painted gold, and he has a large, curving nose. A golden tooth gleams in his mouth.

So the dyed hair, painted fingernails and gold tooth are already pretty weird. But then we come to his clothing.

&gt;The sellsword dresses in loud colors and finery. One yellow outfit, for instance, includes a foam of butter-colored Myrish lace, a doublet with brass medallions in the shape of dandelions, and suede gloves. His high leather boots have ornamental goldwork, and his belt has gilded rings. Another outfit consists of striped pantaloons, high boots of purple leather, a white silk shirt, and a vest of golden rings. Daario also possesses a heavy black cloak.

Bright yellow outfit? Butter-coloured lace?? Striped pantaloons????

Looking at any piece of art depicting our good pal Daario just goes to show how weird it all looks. Even the pictures where the artist managed to make him look attractive (and not like a total creep) make one wonder if it wouldn't have looked way better without the blue hair and bright clothing. In the show they made him look quite normal and it actually made the relationship with Dany seem a lot more realistic.

I just wonder why George decided to describe Daario in this extravagant manner. It's not that it doesn't fit with his personality but it makes Dany's attraction to him seem really odd and out of character for her. George does a good job of making his male protagonist's relationships seem real (Jon and Ygritte comes to mind). I think he may just struggle with the conception of what an all powerful teenage girl would find attractive?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Daario's dumb appearance

The original Lightbringer made by Azor Ahai took immense effort to create, and he had to sacrifice Nissa Nissa to get it to work properly. There blade supposedly was very bright and hot and melted through metal. You know what else is bright and hot and can melt through metal? That’s right, a lightsaber. Lightsabers also canonically take days of meditation over kyber crystals to create. In the next books, it’s going to be revealed that Azor Ahai was actually a Jedi master, and Lightbringer was a particularly powerful lightsaber. In the most recent Star Wars movie, we see that the Jedi and Sith have the spirits of all the previous Jedi and Sith inside them. Azor Ahai come again will literally just be Azor Ahai’s spirit inside someone else. Lightbringer is a lightsaber.

248,"It seems to me that the Tyrells are designed after the Capetian dynasty (which includes the Valois, and the Bourbons) of France. Both have floral symbols (Capetian lily, and Tyrell rose), are more renowned as stewards (rather than as warriors), were the propagators of chivalry, and had extensive ties with the clergy (Catholic Church, the Faith of the Seven).

Both also have similar origin stories, the Capets are a branch of the Robertians, were essentially stewards of the former ruling house, the Carolingians, who ended up ruling over France with the support of the clergy after the death of the last Carolingian monarch. The Tyrells, similarly, were stewards for House Gardener, and ended up ruling over the Reach after the death the last Gardener monarch, with extensive support from the septons and maesters.

[Sauce](https://towerofthehand.com/blog/2017/06/05-politics-of-seven-kingdoms-7/index.html)

The Capetian dynasty relatively managed to survive against all odds. The lowest point of the Capetian dynasty was when House Plantagenet (including Lancaster) conquered half of France, and later on, conquered Paris. This was made possible by the disloyalty of vassal houses. The Capetian dynasty, nonetheless, survived, made iconic by Joan of Arc who paved the way for the retaking of Paris from the English, and the vassals who remained loyal to the Capetians. The Capetians are still alive today, ruling as monarchs of Spain (under the Bourbons).

We *sort* of see a similar situation with the current predicament of the Tyrells. The Capetians also faced internal bickering and rivalry, but unlike the show, I think it'll be similar to history, most of the Reach houses will rally under the Tyrell banner. There will a disastrous betrayal by several Tyrell vassals, but I suspect several of the powerful houses of the Reach will remain loyal to the Tyrells.

252,"I made this golden rule and to find out how the purple wedding was carried out and who was the target.

1. A Schemer never direct involves in their schemes and always keeps their hands clean.
   1. example: Tywin in Red wedding, Littlefinger in Ned's execution, Cersei in taking out Robert. Even Lothar Frey didn't kill anyone in Red wedding, so he is probably safe from the majority of river lords. 

This rule makes Lannisters, Tyrells, Martells out of the equation.

The Schemer should fit these criteria,

1. must have allied with the western alliance 
2. must not be present at the wedding.

Only two factions fit these criteria,

1. Team Aegon.
2. Little finger.

**Team Aegon**

Varys is the only agent present in King's Landing but it is unlikely that he involved in PW because Team Aegon's current goal is to let Western Alliance rule till they build a massive army and from LF we know Varys didn't know anything about Dontos.

This only Leaves LF. Now so facts on The Strangler.

**The Strangler**

The Strangler was first introduced in Prologue of ACOK. Maester Cressen used it in an attempt to kill Red Priestess Melisandra. Maester Cressen is an old man who was desperate to save Lord Stannis from Melisandra's blasphemy, He didn't plan anything with the poison, he just decided to use it the moment he gets the first chance and he died **immediately** drinking the wine.

The reason why I say he didn't plan because Stannis tried his best to keep Cressen out of the feast. Stannis saw something is fishy and even let others insult his father figure to make Cressen leave. Mel, on the other hand, can foresee threats against her life and might have drunk the antidote for the strangler and use Cressen to get more influence over Stannis.

Back to Purple Wedding.

**The Littlefinger**

LF is not Maester Cressen, he is a master schemer but emotionally stupid, He makes (1)five moves in advance with (2)plan B for all his failed moves and (3)always puts the blame on others. He did it in taking down Jon Arryn, Eddard Stark and Stannis Baratheon.

The purple wedding fits all these things,

1. He planned to kill someone(probably Sansa's husband) in Joffrey's wedding, brought in Tyrells to Lannister to make sure that the wedding happens.
2. He spreads a rumor to put Loras in Kingsguard, Loras is the backup plan to kill the target if that target didn't die.
3. He then puts the blame on Olenna Tyrell (Sansa didn't teleport herself to the ship, LF has well-placed spies who might inform everything happening during the wedding before Sansa arrived at the ship)

Now, Who is the target?

Joffrey Water, unlikely, LF gains nothing from killing Joffrey. Lannisters still rule the Iron Throne, Tyrells still get the marriage and he got stuck with a Married Sansa which interferes with his future plan to use Sansa as a Marriage Alliance and Restricts LF from forming an alliance with Royce as bringing Sansa to him after Joffrey's death makes LF as the one who killed the king.

Joffrey died immediately eating Tyrion's pie not after drinking his wine and Ser Balon Swann gave us a very important piece of information which most didn't notice,

&gt;Ser Balon Swann frowned. “The Imp was not alone on the dais. Far from it. That late in the feast, we had people standing and moving about, changing places, slipping off to the privy, **servants were coming and going** … the king and queen had just opened the wedding pie, **every eye was on** them or **those thrice-damned doves**. No one was watching the wine cup.”

The Servants are perfect, They will be checked before entering but will not be noticed by any nobles due to feudal society. Some hired agents can disguise himself as a servant, take the strangler when all are distracted by the wedding pie then put it on Tyrion's pie who is close to Sansa.

**Sansa's husband** is the target, Killing her husband, Littlefinger gains a widowed Sansa. Joffery was the one who supposed to marry Sansa before the Battle of Blackwater, Renly's death and Stannis's invasion forced Littlefinger to change his plans. Then after the battle of Blackwater, Littlefinger made an odd move by requesting Tywin for Sansa's hand, this forced tywin to use Sansa after that LF gave a piece of vital information on Tyrell's plan for Sansa which made tywin to rush Sansa's marriage.

Martin made these few lucky or miracles situations that reward readers for figuring it out, Now LF was able to take down two birds with one stone. Tyrion marrying Sansa played into LF's hands. He gets widowed Sansa and gets rid of Tyrion who knew about the dragon bone dragger and also smart enough to figure out LF's false accounting.",asoiaf,(Spoiler Published) Who is the Target in The Purple Wedding?

256,"*Reposting this from pureasoiaf for those that don't also read that sub*

I propose that Rhaegar died on the trident and his soul went on to live a second life. The kind made possible by warg/skinchanging magic. And Dany is the new host of Rhaegar’s soul, after she was born to Lyanna Stark.

When Rhaegar died, he reached out to someone important to him. **“with his last breath he murmured a woman's name”**. Similarly, Jon and Robb both died thinking of and calling to their wolves. In that way, the three deaths are of a kind, and Rhaegar could have reached out to Lyanna as a warg, or Bran, might reach out.

The soul would move to Lyanna, but it would occupy the body of the unborn Daenarys, the easy target between it and Lyanna. Then that soul would be “reborn” both literally and figuratively as Lyanna’s child.

Elder Brother tells a story in which he fought for Rhaegar, died on the Trident, and was born into a “second life” elsewhere. The story is exactly Rhaegar’s story, if he is living a second life in a host that he was in when it was born. And Elder Brother’s metaphor is ironically literally true for Rhaegar.

&gt;""When I died in the Battle of the Trident. I fought for Prince Rhaegar [...] I should have drowned.
&gt;""Instead I woke here […] naked as my name day. We are all born naked, so I suppose it was only fitting that I come into my second life the same way. I spent the next ten years in silence.""

Rhaegar famously stole Lyanna, as in the Wildling marriage custom, and taking a woman is likened to warging by Hagon. When Rhaegar took Lyanna, that was a marriage, but there is an implication that it was one of the warg variety.

&gt;""Wolves and women wed for life,"" Haggon often said. ""You take one, that's a marriage. The wolf is part of you from that day on, and you're part of him. Both of you will change.""

Dany is told to ""remember who you are” twice, which makes an open issue and mystery about “who” Dany is. And “they say you forget"" who you originally were when living the second life. Meaning if you wanted to know, you would need to remember. Note also that Dany has already dreamed that she was Rhaegar, twice. It would seem that she has been trying to remember even before she was told to do so.

Lastly, Dany is the third head of the dragon, as implied by her HotU vision with Rhaegar, Elia, and Aegon when Rhaegar dramatically looks at Dany and says “there must be one more”. Interestingly we are introduced to a foreign God with three heads named Trios. It is said that “the reborn emerge from the third” head.

So, we have an open mystery about “who” Dany really is, foreshadowing that Dany is Rhaegar, and an implication that the reborn will emerge from Dany. We also the mechanics for this to be possible, the association of Rhaegar with those mechanics, and a reason for it to be unknown to Dany.

271,"So far Euron Greyjoy has been on a rather sucessful ride : after Balon's death that he orchestrated he has taken the Seastone Chair for himself and managed to override Aeron's attempt to keep him from power by winning the kingsmoot hands down with the treasures he found during his exile, his very impressive speech and use of the dragon horn to persuade the Ironborn that he was going to get dragons and use them to conquer all of Westeros for the Ironborn. 

After that he was able of sucessfully neutralize potential oppositions to his rule on the Iron Islands by capturing Aeron before he could try to rally the Ironborn who did not take part in the kingsmoot against him, by naming Erik Ironmaker the regent in the Iron Islands who's hunting the Drowned Men down and by having him officially marry his niece Asha using a seal to prevent her from returning to the isles. 

His assaults on the Reach have also been successful so far and allowed him to comfort the ironborn's obedience to him and to deprive Victarion of his best supporters and he's now threatening Oldtown. And while he's about to face the Redwyne fleet things still look favorable to him after we discovered that he got real valyrian items and that it looks like he's going to sacrifice Aeron and Falia Flowers to get an advantage on the Redwyne fleet by making a blood sacrifice.

272,"I have always been interested in what more we’ll be learning about the state of Stoneheart’s memory, the retention of her past character traits, and her sense of identity.  Mainly because Catelyn’s death was so incredibly traumatic in a way we haven’t seen in others who have been brought back.

It’s fair to say that Catelyn’s mind broke under the weight of the trauma she endured just before she died.  The thoughts she has just prior to death are clearly those of a person who has lost their grip on reality.

So it would seem a bit strange to me if she came back with no side effects at all as a result of all that.  We know she is cruel and single-minded in her hatred, which seems to fuel her very existence.  But what if she’s not as stable as she seems?  

It seems to me that there must be some sort of serious flaw in her perception of reality that may not have clearly manifested itself just yet.  Perhaps her unsound mind will become more and more apparent, coinciding with more and more grisly and merciless acts of violence.  

I just can’t imagine that this won’t be important for her character.  Perhaps Stoneheart will become completely unraveled and be shown to be, ultimately, an insane monster who must be put down.  Something that even the most serious followers can’t bring themselves to support any longer.

The father first and then the son, so both die kings.** The words had been murmured by one of the queen's men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. **""There is power in a king's blood,"" the old maester had warned, ""and better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.""

Lately the Bloodraven =/= TEC theory is being pushed by its proponents on recent threads. To all those who believe the TEC isn’t Bloodraven, I’d like to ask the following five very direct questions : 

1.) The TEC teaches Bran to fly in the dreamscape, while upon meeting Bloodraven the greenseer pledges that Bran “will fly” and teaches him to skinchange ravens and through them fly in waking life - how can this well crafted symmetry be explained away if Bloodraven isn’t the TEC? 

2.) We know that the TEC also visits Jojen’s dreams, and Jojen’s dreams are what lead the companions north to the Nightfort, where they rendezvous with Coldhands on the exact same day - if BR isn’t the TEC, then how is this possible? How did Bloodraven know to send Coldhands to meet them on the *exact* day they arrived at the Nightfort? Secondarily, how did Coldhands know to have Sam and Gilly look for Bran &amp; Co. in the Nightfort, then bring them through the Black Gate to meet him north of the Wall? 

3.) When they ask Coldhands “who is the three-eyed crow?” he immediately responds, without hesitation, denial or question, “a friend” - if Bloodraven isn’t the TEC, how do we explain Coldhands saying he’s not only a friend, but a wizard and greenseer, then takes them to Bloodraven AKA Brynden Rivers who is indeed a greenseer and well reputed to be a sorcerer? 

4.) Many object to Bloodraven being the TEC because he only has one eye, and should somehow have three - if that’s such a critical issue, why doesn’t Bran suddenly have a third eye when he “opens” his third down in the crypts of Winterfell? 

* this one is super odd to me, but I’ve seriously seen it pushed. 

5.) After months together with Bloodraven in the cave, Bran continues to experience the TEC in his dreams, presumably still interacting with the crow as we’ve seen in every other instance we’re given, and even says that while the children call him “the last greenseer” he’s still a TEC in the dreamscape - if Bloodraven isn’t the TEC, how do we explain that the crow isn’t somehow raising alarm bells that Bran hasn’t gone to the right place *or* contradicting Bran to correct him that Bloodraven and the TEC are not one and the same entity?

But these hostages are surely not going to remain at the hands of house Frey and Lannister for the rest of the story, in particular since Jaime Lannister has ordered for Edmure to be taken to Casterly Rock along with Jeyne Westerling and that he has also ordered the Freys to give to Tommen the rest of their captives after the taking of Riverrun.

303,"**TLDR: The Seven are actually One, and that One is the Stranger AKA the Great Other**


This theory is primarily based off of this quote from Melisandre (ACOK, Davos I) when she burns the Seven statues on Dragonstone as a tribute to R’hllor (bolded for emphasis):


&gt; ""R'hllor, come to us in our darkness,"" she called. ""Lord of Light, **we offer you these false gods, these seven who are one, and him the enemy.** Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.” 
- ACOK Davos I


It’s no secret that Melisandre believes in only R’hllor and the Great Other, so it’s not surprising to see her call the Seven false gods. But what is surprising is that she calls them “one, and him the enemy.” Her enemy is the Great Other, the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror - so are the Seven really the Great Other, the enemy of humanity?


(To establish something quickly - when I say the Great Other I am referring to a leader of the Others/Wights. Melisandre clearly believes that the Great Other is behind the Others invading Westeros, and leads Stannis to the Wall to wage her war.)


It’s very curious that of all the magic and power we see connected with gods, none of it seems to be connected with the Seven. We’ve seen magic of the Old Gods, of R’hllor, even of the Many-Faced God and the Drowned God. And yet we hear nothing about power from the Seven, even though they are by the far the largest and most prominent religion in Westeros.


There are of course many theories as to why this is, but what if we have seen magic from the Seven, and we just haven’t realized it? That magic is, of course, the magic of the Others. While I admit there isn’t a ton of evidence for this, but there is some circumstantial evidence that I think is interesting.


The biggest and best evidence comes from Melisandre herself, one of the characters most in-tune with the magic in the world of ASOIAF. Multiple times she refers to the Seven as “false gods,”:


&gt; ""Nor Garth,"" said the queen's man she knew as Alf of Runnymudd, one of the first to exchange his seven false gods for the truth of R'hllor.
- ADWD Melisandre I


&gt; ""R'hllor, come to us in our darkness,"" she called. ""Lord of Light, we offer you these false gods, these seven who are one, and him the enemy. Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.”
- ACOK Davos I


But the biggest evidence by far comes in that second quote of hers. We know that Melisandre considers her enemy to be the Great Other, and here she literally names the Seven one, and her enemy - in other words, the Great Other.


There are some other interesting connections between the Seven, specifically the Stranger, and the Others/Wights. One of which is in the very symbol that the Seven holds sacred - a star:


&gt; The hooded man lifted his pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without hesitation. The sword laid the intruder open to the bone, taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, eyes, **eyes like blue stars burning.** Jon knew that face. Othor, he thought, reeling back. Gods, he's dead, he's dead, I saw him dead.
- AGOT Jon VII


&gt; ""What color are their eyes?"" [Jon] asked [Gilly].
""Blue. As bright as **blue stars**, and as cold.”
- ACOK Jon III


&gt; He punched and pulled at the wight's wrists, to no avail. He kicked Paul between the legs, uselessly. **The world shrank to two blue stars**, a terrible crushing pain, and a cold so fierce that his tears froze over his eyes.
- ASOS Sam III


&gt;  The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. ""And that was the fault in him,"" she would add, ""for all men must know fear."" A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and **eyes like blue stars**. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.
- ASOS Bran IV


&gt; Two, three, four. Bran lost count. They surged up violently amidst sudden clouds of snow. Some wore black cloaks, some ragged skins, some nothing. All of them had pale flesh and black hands. **Their eyes glowed like pale blue stars.**
- ADWD Bran II


That’s five different characters across multiple books all describing the eyes of the Others in the same way - as blue stars. In fact, almost every time the Others appear in the text their eyes are related to stars, not unlike how the seven pointed star is consistently mentioned in reference to the Seven.


But perhaps most interesting…


&gt; And the seventh face . . . the Stranger was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable. Here the face was a black oval, **a shadow with stars for eyes**. It made Catelyn uneasy. She would get scant comfort there.
- ACOK Catelyn IV


Not only is there a depiction of the Seven featuring stars, there’s a depiction featuring stars for eyes - just like the Others. It’s this quote that first points us in the direction of the Stranger as the ‘seven who is one.’


But there are more reasons to take a closer look at the Stranger specifically. The Stranger is often the god of the Seven who stands alone, apart from the others. Unlike the other six, the Stranger is viewed in a negative light, and most do not pray to him in the same way they pray to the other six. If there is one god of the Seven who is 'one,' it would undoubtedly be the Stranger. 


Furthermore the Stranger represents death, an easy connection with the Others and the undead Wights. The Stranger is often depicted with face concealed, and as Catelyn says, is “unknown and unknowable,” not unlike the Others, beings shrouded in mystery despite many attempts to learn more about them.


The Stranger is also frequently described as not entirely human. Catelyn calls him “less and more than human,” and she’s not the only major character to point it out:


&gt; The Mother's altar and the Warrior's swam in light, but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well, and there were even a few flames dancing below the **Stranger's half-human face**
- ACOK Sansa V


&gt; The Stranger in the shadows, his half-human face concealed beneath a hooded mantle.
- AFFC Jaime IV


It’s clear that the Others are definitely not fully human. They’re described as having “flesh pale as milk,” bleed “pale blue blood,” and move in almost complete silence. And yet they are familiar in the way that they have arms and a head and hair and bleed when cut. They walk on two legs, ride horses, fight with swords and scream when stabbed. They are both human and not human - half-human, like the Stranger.


Lastly, the Stranger is also depicted as being more animal than human:


&gt; They were all afire now, Maid and Mother, Warrior and Smith, the Crone with her pearl eyes and the Father with his gilded beard; even the Stranger, carved to look more animal than human.
- ACOK Davos I


And the Others:


&gt; The bear was dead, pale and rotting, its fur and skin all sloughed off and half its right arm burned to bone, yet still it came on. Only its eyes lived. Bright blue, just as Jon said. **They shone like frozen stars.**
- ASOS Sam I

308,"I have read many theories on reddit, tumblr, forums and reached at the conclusion that it is possible that Arya will rule Winterfell in the end. Here are some thoughts why.

I have read an old comment of GRRM where he talks about his books and he describes them as"" *almost a generational saga, telling the life stories of these five characters, three men and two women. The five key players are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, and three of the children of Winterfell, Arya, Bran, and the bastard Jon Snow*“.If Martin thinks these five as the main characters, I do not think that Sansa will be that important and she will not become a queen in the North. Maybe she will end in the Vale in the books.Her Vale storyline was cut in the show but it is much more important in the books.

Also I do not know if it is deliberate or not but those who continue a house are always with hair and eyes that are characteristic for their family.Starks, Tullys, Lannisters have been for thousand of years with their hair colour and eyes.Even in the Targaryan family no dark haired Targaryen has been a king.They always die before they rule.

Also there is a quote from Varys about FAegon in the books and **what is needed to be a good ruler**. ”*Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid*.“ 

However **all of this can be said for Arya as well**. She has trained with Syrio Forel, has typical highborn education, learns to speaks several tongues, she is familiar with the Seven from her mother, the old gods from her father, with the Many-faced God from the faceless men. She has also strong sense of justice-even incognito in Braavos she still performed the ancestral duties of her House-she fed a man of the Night’s Watch (gave Sam her last two baked clams).It’s a nice callback to Robb offering Yoren shelter at Winterfell, and Ned offering Yoren whatever he needed in KL. It also foreshadows her execution of Dareon in the books as a NW deserter, slitting his throat just as Ned took Gared’s head for the same crime in the very first chapter she has lived with the smallfolk, she has bind up the Hound’s wound, she has known what it’s like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid ever since she escaped Kings Landing.

There is a quote in the first book.*“Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to* ***queens****. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.”***Father to queens not queen**. Sansa is marrying Joffrey. But **why queens**? Unless GRRM wants to hint to us that Arya is going to become a queen, to rule?

People argue that  GRRM abandoned his plans about Arya becoming queen after he wrote the Game of Thrones book. But there is this quote in “A Dance with Dragons”!’ ’***The girl smiled in a way that reminded Jon so much of his little sister*** *that it almost broke his heart****.*** *The snowflakes were melting on her cheeks, but her hair was wrapped in a swirl of lace that Satin had found somewhere, and* ***the snow had begun to collect there, giving her a frosty crown.*** *Her cheeks were flushed and red, and her eyes sparkled*.”

Notice the connection of frosty crown with Arya. Could this not be a hint of Arya becoming a queen?

So that is why I think GRRM will make Arya rule the North.All those years she has been prepared to rule. Vengeance is not central for her character as D&amp;D think.",asoiaf,(Spoilers extended)Arya's ending in the books

Most times it is said that an egg was laid in the cradle of their respective Targaryen and the egg ended up hatching. 

If there are other dragons, can they be born naturally? Or has it always taken a blood sacrifice to make the eggs hatch? 

There's a lot of discussion that the maesters have tried to hide as much information as possible about the dragons... Is it possible that ""Fire and Blood"" has been censored? 

Or is the secret of the dragon's birth something that is only passed on between Targaryens, and the maesters have never known how the dragons were actually born?

Or were they born naturally until the maesters did something to change it?

In my opinion it has always required a sacrifice, but it is something that only people with Valyrian blood knew and due to family disputes it was lost.

318,"I recently completed a reread of AGOT and I had a small question I wanted to inquire about.  One of the things I was wondering about during my reread is whether or not there is any foreshadowing of Melisandre before we are introduced to her in Clash.  I don't know exactly when George had her in mind as a central character but I think it is possible that he already had her in mind in the first book.  The idea that occurred to me took place in Arya's last chapter before Ned's execution.  The Lannisters decided to use the same ship that was supposed to take Arya and Sansa back home as a trap for Arya.  The name of the ship is the Wind Witch.  Given that witches traditionally steal children, I think this is an apt name for a ship that is being used to attempt to steal a child.  The more I thought about it, it occurred to me that Melisandre fits the traditional Witch definition pretty well herself in the sense that she attempts to sacrifice Edric and she probably will attempt the same with Shireen.  Also, at another point, Melisandre sacrifices a person to the flames in order to create wind to blow Stannis and his fleet to the Wall.  So in summary, Mel kind of fits the traditional definition of a Witch as she is connected to sacrificing children.  At the same time, she seems to be connected to the creation of wind.  

The question I wanted to ask is do you guys think the ship the Wind Witch in AGOT could foreshadow or be a symbolic representation of Melisandre as a future character?  Also, if you know of any other foreshadowing for Mel I would love to hear it.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] The Red Witch

Ive googled it a little bit to make sure I at least get reminded of some of the stuff but my question is: Do we know if The Others are inherently bad? As far as I remember we dont know if they are evil or really just anything but another humanoid race. Is there anything that The Others do where if you replaced them with humans you would say ""wow humans are inherently evil""? (In fact I vaguely remember The Others letting the free folk get to the wall and not troubling them)

Of course we just dont know a lot about them.

325,"I know theres so little to go off of but that's kinda fun right? Firstly I think it's interesting that it is the capital of ""N'ghai"" and they are so close to the Jogos Nhai people. I think the closeness of N'ghai and Nhai are no coincidence and I think one of them originates from the other. Also I think it's odd that whatever Yi Ti was so scared of that they built the five forts for is completely accessible to Nefer across the cannibal sands yet there isn't anything mentioned in the way of Nefer being in danger or scared, it is mentioned that they are the last city of N'ghai but it wasn't brought up in a way that indicates anything horrifying. Other minor things to note is that it's weird that its mentioned to be a city of torturers and necromancers, like I know that things in the east are often scued to maesters but why would it get this reputation and for what reason would a city have so many torturers? Perhaps it is a city that heavily practices the Red Religion and they think of the red priests and priestesses as necromancers because they bring people back? Also the proximity of the thousand isles is interesting. Perhaps the thousand islands used to be part of N'ghai. This is heavy speculation but fun, but what if the thousand islands used to be part of N'ghai but fell short of practicing the religion of R'hllor so they got punished by being flooded, and that's why they are so afraid of water. Anyways those are just my thoughts, what are yours?",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Extended) Since it rarely ever gets discussed, what do you guys think is up with Nefer?"
329,"Throughout the books of ASOIAF, we see good characters react with revulsion when confronted with the killing of children. To name just a few: Dany in Meereen, Ned in King's Landing (both after the Rebellion, in flashbacks, and in present-day GOT), Sam at Craster's Keep, and Tyrion when he learns of  Cersei's killing of Robert's bastard daughter Barra, a babe at the breast. 

It seems like possibly the closest thing there is to a universal moral rule in Planetos: killing children = bad! 

This theme is introduced early via the character of Craster, who sacrifices his sons to the Others -- to do what with, we don't exactly know. But one of Craster's wives refers to the Others as ""Craster's sons,"" so perhaps they simply raise the boys as their own -- turning them into Others through some dark, icy magic. (This would fit with the idea of the Others as somewhat like elves or the Sidhe; stories of elf-like creatures stealing human babies are very old.)

Moreover, the Others are the closest thing the world of ASOIAF has to orcs -- evil creatures with no apparent motivation other than killing humanity. And George himself has a famous [quote](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-r-r-martin-the-rolling-stone-interview-242487/) about orcs:

&gt;Tolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn’t ask the question: What was Aragorn’s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren’t gone – they’re in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide and kill them? **Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc cradles?**

I predict that in TWOW, we will see a scene in which one of Craster's younger sons -- essentially a child or baby Other -- appears, and one of our beloved characters (Jon?) has to decide whether to kill it. And I think that person *will* probably kill it. And then we, as readers, will have to decide whether we're OK with that.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] We will see a baby Other and someone we love will kill it
330,"I'll try to give a reasoned opinion; also I shall not think about how they get to the throne. Let's just have a scenario in which ""x"" character got the throne without any deaths.

Ned would have most likely been a terrible ruler. In the single day he sat the throne, he managed to spawn guerilla warfare in the Riverlands and create tension with the family that financially holds together Westeros. He is also plain horrible at The Game of Thrones, so he probably would lose the throne in a minimal amount of time.

Cersei reveals herself to be a poor choice. When left to her devices, she messes stuff up so terribly she gets imprisoned by an armed group *she* gave arms to. She is also just plain insane, and would most likely get the throne swooped right under her nose.

Littlefinger, well, let's just say good ol' Petyr doesn't show himself fit to rule. He has every characteristic useful for keeping the throne, and not a single that would make him anything that resembles a good ruler by any definition.

Joffrey, he got it, just so he could show he's a kid and can do nothing as king but wait, and in the time being have Tywin be king.

Tywin is an interesting choice. On the one hand, he is great at keeping order and has a fine understanding of politics and economics. On the other hand, he'd leave the throne to a bunch of incompetent people; and he's a totalitarian with no tolerance for compromise or opinions.

Balon Greyjoy, just because he fights the war of the Five Kings. He shows he's terrible, whatever.

Danaeris. She's as controversial as Earth's roundess, thanks to the show. While a lot of people argue favourably in her regards, she'd most likely be horrible when governing for the first time, a population whose customs she has no familiarity towards, and she's still 11 years old after all. Probably an unwise choice.

Before we talk about the two four-billion pound whales in the room, let's talk Tyrion. He shows himself capable of piety and kindness, but also fits of rage and hatred. But regardless he shows competence when he is Hand of the King, and would be an averagely good choice I think.

Now, to the main candidates. In one corner, he's lean but not exactly mean, Renly Baratheon! On the other corner, Stannis.

Renly Is extremely flamboyant, flashy, and ambitious. He is said to be a great ruler by everyone but Stannis, but since Stannis Is biased, we may assume those who oppose him aren't. But we are told he's a good ruler by Loras, Margaery and Brienne, all of whom are closely related to him. He still has powerful allies and is a man beloved by the commonfolk, he is implied to be pretty frivolous, and I can't confidently say he's the best one

Stannis, by many called The Mannis, is the most controversial potential ruler to ever walk Planetos after Danaeris *insert titles*. He's dutiful to a comical extent, so much he'd probably annoy a lot of nobles and maybe even the commonfolk. He is shown to be competent, but his worship of R'hollor may be hard to digest for the Westerosi. He also has his whole Azor-Ahai-but-not ordeal going on. Although he probably would do fine for himself, I don't he'd manage to keep the throne.

Granted their history with confronting the Others and armies of the dead, wouldn't it make sense for cremation to be part of their funeral custom, just like it seems to be for the Free Folk? Clearly at some point in time they feared their dead would rise, hence the tradition of placing iron swords on tombs, so why not just burn the dead altogether? Did the First Men already have a strong custom of burying their dead before they arrived in Westeros, and old habits die hard? (Side note: the swords on the tombs thing never made a ton of sense to me. In real world folklore, iron was seen as a defense against the fae and demons, but is there any reason to believe that this is true for the Others? I suppose this could be viewed as a corruption of the truth. The Others have two or three clear weaknesses, but the details got blurred over time, maybe.)

It could be that this just hasn't occurred to George, but I suppose it could also lend some credence to the idea that Starks and Others were once allied. Perhaps they felt they had less to fear from the Others, or perhaps they welcomed new ""life"" being breathed into the bones of their ancestors.

The intro with the piano, Cersei's trial FINALLY being over, Tower of Joy, R+L=J fucking CONFIRMED, King of the North!, Dany sailing West with Varys, Dorne, Tyrells, The Unsullied, 3 dragons and A DOTHRAKI HORDE, SOON TO BE ON AN OPEN FIELD at her side. Each scene was gold.

The show's highs were extrordinary and S6 was it's peak for me with some quality TV and the fandom's theories. It was incredible. Everybody quessing what'll happen next, how it'll go down in the books and much more positive community in general. I stayed up until like 4am to watch each new episode followed by streams by my favorite content creators breaking down each new episode. The podcasts and all the content created was incredible and I just ate that shit up and asked for more. Also the memes. Holy fuck the memes were funny.

351,"**Stannis**

It is hard to like a character like Stannis from the start of the books, Initial I thought Stannis is like Tywin, Jaime and Cersei, bend the rules and laws of society to fit their wants and think they can get away with anything.

After five books, Characters like Jaime and Cersei stayed the same while Stannis had the biggest character development in the whole series.

Like Mace Tyrell, Stannis is a clean slate. Stannis done nothing wrong.

Martin giving us a pov chapter on Melisandra also explained a lot about Stannis. Mel is a charlatan who uses powers and tricks to create an illusion of light and shadows.

Introduction of Glass Candle also changed my view on Stannis. There are mind-benders in Martin's world who influence key people to change the outcomes of certain events.

Take Euron for an example in Iron Captain, AFFC.

&gt;Who knows more of gods than I? Horse gods and fire gods, gods made of gold with gemstone eyes, gods carved of cedar wood, gods chiseled into mountains, gods of empty air . . . I know them all. I have seen their peoples garland them with flowers, and shed the blood of goats and bulls and children in their names. And I have heard the prayers, in half a hundred tongues. **Cure my withered leg**, **make the maiden love me**, **grant me a healthy son**. Save me, succor me, make me wealthy . . . protect me! Protect me from mine enemies, protect me from the darkness, **protect me from the crabs inside my belly**, **from** the **horselords**, **from** the **slavers**, **from** the **sellswords** at my door. **Protect** me from the **Silence**."" He laughed. ""Godless? Why, Aeron, I am the godliest man ever to raise sail! You serve one god, Damphair, but I have served ten thousand. From Ib to Asshai, when men see my sails, they pray.

Some powerful being is feeding Euron these prayers from 

1. Bran(Cure my withered leg)
2. Tyrion(make the maiden love me)
3. Robb(grant me a healthy son)
4. Hoster(protect me from the crabs inside my belly)

and make Euron believe that he himself is a God. As Euron believes himself a God, he wants to become one, His first step, Kill his younger brother who was infected by grey-scale. Euron heard his brother's prayer and granted him peace form agony.

Martin made the biggest twist in this unexpected chapter.

When someone is influenced by mind-bending, they cannot be awoken, doesn't eat well and lose track of time. We saw this in Bran, Doran, Catelyn, Sam, Jaime, Lancel, and **Stannis.** Oh... didn't you forget about Stannis.

In my recent Re-read of ACOK, I noticed that Stannis was having nightmares, nightmares about Renly's death in the tent.

Someone, either Bloodraven or Shrouded Lord or Archmaester Marwyn, is trying to drove Stannis into feeling guilty about Renly's death by making him believe that he did the deed by showing Stannis what happened in the tent from the viewpoint of the shadow/invisible monster.

Whoever that is, The powerful being doesn't want Lannisters to lose.

This is odd from Martin, He is writing a story about how humanity is unprepared to face their impending doom yet he writes that powerful beings are sabotaging the few guys who actually try.",asoiaf,(Spoiler Published) My thought on Stannis. Why most readers sympathize with character Jaime but despise Stannis?

Largely made from inputs from a GNC theory whose author i was not able to find since the post was more than 7 years old.If someone claims it I shall be more than happy to credit. That was one good theory !



According to Jon and Alys Karstark, it’s a northern tradition for the old men to head out on sacrificial hunting trips come winter. They’re the most expendable, as only a select few must remain to educate the young while women and children can’t be spared if there’s to be a next generation.

[Jon:] “My lady, how do things stand at Karhold with your food stores?”

“Not well.” Alys sighed. “My father took so many of our men south with him that only the women and young boys were left to bring the harvest in. Them and the men too old or crippled to go off to war. Crops withered in the fields or were pounded into the mud by autumn rains. And now the snows come. This winter will be hard. Few of the old will survive it, and many children will perish, as well.”

It was a tale that any northman knew well […] [Jon told her,] “When the snows fall and food grows scarce, the young must travel to the winter towns or take service at one castle or the other. The old men gather up what strength remains in them and announce that they are going hunting. Some are found come spring. More are never seen again.”

“It is much the same at Karhold.” That did not surprise him. (Jon X, ADWD)

This can also be seen with the winter wolves of Cregan Stark as well as his own main host.They do not care for their own lives for they march to an end worthy of a song.They march to avenge The Red Wedding ,The murder of Bran and Rickon ,Torrhen's Square ,Deepwood motte,Lady Hornwoods fingers ,they remember it all.


Two years past, Cregan Stark had made a promise to Prince Jacaerys. Now he had come to make good his pledge, though Jace and the queen his mother were both dead. “The North remembers,” Lord Stark declared when Prince Aegon, Lord Corlys, and the Lads bid him welcome.


When Kermit Tully pointed out that Storm’s End, Oldtown, and Casterly Rock were as strong as Stark’s own Winterfell (if not stronger) and would not fall easily (if at all), and young Ben Blackwood echoed him and said, “Half your men will die, Lord Stark,” the grey-eyed Wolf of Winterfell replied, “They died the day we marched, boy.”


Like the Winter Wolves before them, most of the men who had marched south with Lord Cregan Stark did not expect to see their homes again. The snows were already deep beyond the Neck, the cold winds rising; in keeps and castles and humble villages throughout the North, the great and small alike prayed to their carved wooden god-trees that this winter might be short.

 Those with fewer mouths to feed fared better in the dark days, so it had long been the custom in the North for old men, younger sons, the unwed, the childless, the homeless, and the hopeless to leave hearth and home when the first snows fell, so that their kin might live to see another spring. Victory was secondary to the men of these winter armies; they marched for glory, adventure, plunder, and most of all, a worthy end.

(The Aftermath-The hour of the wolf , Fire and Blood 1 )

This extract of Arya further drives the point home.

[Arya] remembered a tale she had heard from Old Nan about how sometimes, during a long winter, men who’d lived beyond their years would announce that they were going hunting. And their daughters would weep and their sons would turn their faces to the fire, she could hear Old Nan saying, but no one would stop them or ask what game they meant to hunt, with the snows so deep and the cold wind howling. (Arya II, AFFC)

The defeated riverlords are discontent, and the northmen keep faith with the Starks; the Freys are pariahs to enemies and allies alike while the Lannisters are in decline; Tywin’s legacy compares unfavorably with Ned’s despite the former’s political expediency being praised over the latter’s rigid idealism. Seems that Ned’s oft ridiculed honor has achieved a posthumous victory, love mingled with a healthy respect proving to be a much more lasting influence on people than a reign secured by fear and force, which not only dies with you but warps your children into unsuitable heirs.

This can be seen in the following extracts-

 


Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK. (Jon I, ADWD)



“A thousand years before the Conquest, a promise was made, and oaths were sworn in the Wolf’s Den before the old gods and the new. When we were sore beset and friendless, hounded from our homes and in peril of our lives, the wolves took us in and nourished us and protected us against our enemies. The city is built upon the land they gave us. In return, we swore that we should always be their men. Stark men!” (Davos III, ADWD)



“Foes and false friends are all around me, Lord Davos. They infest my city like roaches, and at night I feel them crawling over me.” The fat man’s fingers coiled into a fist, and all his chins trembled. “My son Wendel came to the Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder’s bread and salt, hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. Murdered, I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared, jape with Symond, promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter… but never think that means I have forgotten. The north remembers, Lord Davos. The north remembers, and the mummer’s farce is almost done.” (Davos IV, ADWD)



[Dustin:] “Lord Wyman is not the only man who lost kin at your Red Wedding, Frey. Do you imagine Whoresbane loves you any better? If you did not hold the Greatjon, he would pull out your entrails and make you eat them, as Lady Hornwood ate her fingers. Flints, Cerwyns, Tallharts, Slates… They all had men with the Young Wolf.”

“House Ryswell, too,” said Roger Ryswell.

“Even Dustins out of Barrowton.” Lady Dustin parted her lips in a thin, feral smile. “The north remembers, Frey.” (Theon VI, A Ghost in Winterfell, ADWD)



Northern hill clansmen brave death by winter and the sword both, hundreds making a grueling march to Winterfell, for a chance to save Ned Stark’s daughter.
They do not wish to returrn and they do not think they will.They leave to fight to a bitter end for what they believe in.



“Winter is almost upon us, boy. And winter is death. I would sooner my men die fighting for the Ned’s little girl than alone and hungry in the snow, weeping tears that freeze upon their cheeks. No one sings songs of men who die like that. As for me, I am old. This will be my last winter. Let me bathe in Bolton blood before I die. I want to feel it spatter across my face when my axe bites deep into a Bolton skull. I want to lick it off my lips and die with the taste of it on my tongue.” (Asha II, The King’s Prize, ADWD)


On to fake!Arya's wedding !


[Davos] had hoped to hear Lord Wyman say, And now I shall declare for King Stannis, but instead the fat man smiled an odd, twinkling smile and said, “And now I have a wedding to attend. I am too fat to sit a horse, as any man with eyes can plainly see. […] My body has become a prison more dire than the Wolf’s Den. Even so, I must go to Winterfell. Roose Bolton wants me on my knees, and beneath the velvet courtesy he shows the iron mail. I shall go by barge and litter, attended by a hundred knights and my good friends from the Twins. The Freys came here by sea. They have no horses with them, so I shall present each of them with a palfrey as a guest gift. Do hosts still give guest gifts in the south?”

“Some do, my lord. On the day their guest departs.”

“Perhaps you understand then.” (Davos IV, ADWD)




When Roose Bolton summons the northern lords to Barrowton to swear fealty to him and attend Ramsay’s wedding to fake!Arya, to be held later in Winterfell, he also instructs them to bring hostages, presumably their sons or heirs.

[Robett Glover:] “Much and more has happened whilst you have been confined within these walls [Wolf’s Den, White Harbor’s fortress prison], Lord Davos. Moat Cailin has fallen, and Roose Bolton has returned to the north with Ned Stark’s younger daughter. A host of Freys came with him. Bolton has sent forth ravens summoning all the lords of the north to Barrowton. He demands homage and hostages… and witnesses to the wedding of Arya Stark and his bastard, Ramsay Snow, by which match the Boltons mean to lay claim to Winterfell.” (Davos IV, ADWD)

[Ramsay:] “Lord Pig must have brought half the food in White Harbor with him.”

[Roose:] “Forty wayns full of foodstuffs […] Lord Wyman likes to eat. You may have noticed.”

“What I noticed was that he brought no hostages.”

“I noticed that, as well.”

“What do you mean to do about it?”

“It is a quandary.” (Theon III, Reek III, ADWD)

Yet Lord Manderly doesn’t heed the new Warden of the North, leaving his son and heir, Wylis, recently returned to him by the Lannisters, safely at home. More interestingly, several of the other houses follow suit. Robett Glover, who is his unwed brother’s heir to Deepwood Motte, disappears off to who knows where, though he was in White Harbor with Manderly. Old Lord Locke comes to Winterfell, but there’s no indication he’s accompanied by a son or heir, perhaps the younger man in the Merman’s Court during Davos’s audience with Manderly.

Not only that, but House Cerwyn’s heir, Lady Jonella, apparently takes her leave of the wedding party after Barrowton. She’s nowhere to be found in Winterfell despite living only a half day’s ride away and being one of the signatories of Ramsay’s announcement of his nuptials.

Ramsay Bolton, Lord of the Hornwood, [the parchment] read, in a huge, spiky hand. The brown ink came away in flakes when Jon brushed it with his thumb. Beneath Bolton’s signature, Lady Dustin, Lady Cerwyn, and four Ryswells had appended their own marks and seals. A cruder hand had drawn the giant of House Umber.

“Might we know what it says, my lord?” asked Iron Emmett.

Jon saw no reason not to tell him. “Moat Cailin is taken. The flayed corpses of the ironmen have been nailed to posts along the kingsroad. Roose Bolton summons all leal lords to Barrowton to affirm their loyalty to the Iron Throne and celebrate his son’s wedding to…” His heart seemed to stop for a moment […] “He’s to marry Arya Stark. My little sister.” (Jon VI, ADWD)

The case of the Umbers is an entire different one . For starters, neither Crowfood nor Whoresbane is the Greatjon’s heir, and Jon suggests that they’d uphold the lawful succession unto death.

[Jon:] “The Greatjon has sons and daughters both. In the north, the children of a man’s body still come before his uncles, ser.”

“Unless they die. Dead children come last everywhere.”

“Suggest that in the hearing of Mors Umber [Crowfood, who joins Stannis], Ser Godry [Farring], and you will learn more of death than you might wish.” (Jon IV, ADWD)


Later, the division of the Umber forces at Winterfell is curiously exact. All of Crowfood’s men outside the walls are young and green while Whoresbane within has under his command hoary old warriors, graybeards all.

The banker [Tycho Nestoris] studied her with shrewd dark eyes. “You are the Lady Asha of House Greyjoy, unless I am mistaken.”

“I am Asha of House Greyjoy, aye. Opinions differ on whether I’m a lady.”

The Braavosi smiled. “We’ve brought a gift for you.” He beckoned to the men [two Night’s Watch escorts, Tristifer Botley, Qarl the Maid et al.] behind him. “We had expected to find [King Stannis] at Winterfell. This same blizzard has engulfed the castle, alas. Beneath its walls, we found Mors Umber with a troop of raw green boys, waiting for the king’s coming. He gave us this [Theon, Jeyne!Arya].” (Asha III, The Sacrifice, ADWD)


[Stannis:] “Tell me, Theon, how many men did Mors Umber have with him at Winterfell?”

“None. No men.” He grinned at his own wit. “He had boys. I saw them.” Aside from a handful of half-crippled serjeants, the warriors that Crowfood had brought down from Last Hearth were hardly old enough to shave. “Their spears and axes were older than the hands that clutched them. It was Whoresbane Umber who had the men, inside the castle. I saw them, too. Old men, every one.” Theon tittered. “Mors took the green boys, and Hother took the greybeards. All the real men went with the Greatjon and died at the Red Wedding. Is that what you wanted to know, Your Grace?”

(Theon I, TWOW)


As seen above -

“Not well.” Alys sighed. “My father took so many of our men south with him that only the women and young boys were left to bring the harvest in. Them and the men too old or crippled to go off to war. Crops withered in the fields or were pounded into the mud by autumn rains. And now the snows come. This winter will be hard. Few of the old will survive it, and many children will perish, as well.”
(Jon X , ADWD)

I doubt the Umbers are any better off than the Karstarks in their harvest, having also answered Robb’s call to arms in force. Framed thus, Whoresbane’s loyalty to the Boltons seems even more suspect than it already is given that the Umbers are coerced into cooperation by threats to the Greatjon’s life. The two uncles, both old men themselves, have arranged matters so that the Boltons must house and feed their useless mouths, at the same time depriving the hated Freys, while their young men, women, and children alone draw on the Umber stores, which would’ve happened regardless. Should their ruse be discovered, those inside Winterfell are no great loss to the house. Would, in fact, probably find dying spattered in the blood of their enemies a far happier prospect than freezing to death alone in the wilds, like the mountain clansmen do.

Similarly, the failure of the northern lords to bring hostages as demanded makes more sense assuming there’s some treachery afoot, IMO. As the theory goes, Manderly is secretly plotting with the Glovers, Umbers, and Lockes prior to Barrowton, so none of these houses show up there with any hostages. Then, at Barrowton, Manderly brings the Hornwoods, Cerwyns, and Tallharts into his pro-Stark conspiracy, hence why Lady Cerwyn departs before the wedding party changes venue to Winterfell.

The final result is that the northmen in Winterfell are willing, even expecting, to die for the Stark cause or in pursuit of bloody vengeance against the murderers of their kin. They would not have lasted the winter, anyways, and by their own choice. At least this way, their lives can purchase a legacy for their heirs, who are kept away from the anticipated slaughter, beyond simple survival by freeing the North of the Boltons and Freys in an act of defiance against the Lannisters on the Iron Throne

358,"How much do we really know about the Bridge of Skulls? I know the gorge below it is deep and filled with bones and everything, but why do Wildlings in general try crossing at the Bridge of Skulls? It's apparently just like a gaping hole in the defenses of the Wall and Westwatch by the Bridge isn't manned so why would Wildlings not take that route rather than trying to climb a 700 foot wall?

Then, to add to that, I know Mance's plan didn't bank on Jon Snow betraying them so the assault on Castle Black should have gone smoother, but wouldn't it have been a lot easier to just assault the Bridge of Skulls as well? He had thousands of warriors, why only send 300 to the Bridge to fight what was going to be the bulk of the Watch's fighting force? Even with it being pretty much equal number wise, the Watch lost 100 men, just send 1000 guys instead of 300 and they'd probably overwhelm them or at least kill the bulk of them. It also seems strange this strategy hasn't been employed before by some industrious Wildling. I get the Bridge is probably easy to defend but not more than a 700 foot tall wall.

Then there comes the Others. Unless there's a magic barrier aspect that extends beyond where the Wall ends, can't they just walk over the Bridge? Or at the very least they could send their wights across? At this point I'm getting into show territory because obviously there's been no breach attempted by the Others in the books so far but since we all figure it's going that way, I wanted to get your opinion on why exactly the Bridge of Skulls doesn't seem to get more play.",asoiaf,Why not attack the Bridge of Skulls?

361,"I'm a little confused about which house Joy Hill was supposed to marry into.

After the Red Wedding, Tywin tells Tyrion:

&gt; ""The price [of the Red Wedding] was cheap by any measure. The crown shall grant Riverrun to Ser Emmon Frey once the Blackfish yields. Lancel and Daven must marry Frey girls, **Joy [Hill] is to wed one of Lord Walder's natural sons when she's old enough**, and Roose Bolton becomes Warden of the North and takes home Arya Stark.""

(ASOS Tyrion VI)

But later, Sybell Spicer and Jamie have this conversation:

&gt; ""**Mention was made of a match for [Raynald Westerling] as well. A bride from Casterly Rock. Your lord father said that Raynald should have joy of him, if all went as we hoped.""**
&gt;
&gt; Even from the grave, Lord Tywin's dead hand moves us all. ""**Joy is my late uncle Gerion's natural daughter.** A betrothal can be arranged, if that is your wish, but any marriage will need to wait.  Joy was nine or ten when last I saw her.""
&gt;
&gt; ""His natural daughter?"" Lady Sybell looked as if she had swallowed a lemon. ""You want a Westerling to wed a bastard?""

(AFFC, Jamie VII)


Joy Hill is claimed to have been promised to two different individuals.  Why is there a discrepancy?  

Tywin would have no reason to lie to Tyrion about the deal, so Joy Hill was promised to one of Walder's bastards.

By the time Sybell talks with Jamie about a betrothal, Tywin is dead, so we will never have Tywin's confirmation or denial of Sybell's claims.

Tywin could have made two separate promises, and was planning to break one of them later.  But a Lannister ""always pays his debts"", which makes me think he wouldn't have set up two betrothals for the same individual.  And why not mention this problem to Tyrion?

Since the conversation between Sybell and Jamie happened well after Tywin's death, Sybell could be lying.  But that doesn't sit right with me.  It's the wording.  Either she had a poor choice of words, or she was purposely angling for her son and the Westerling heir to marry a bastard and her response to Jamie was an act.  Neither seems likely.  

Which seems to leave the third option - GRRM made a mistake.

I wanted to do a post discussing which characters fans believe have secret parentages, posing in different identities or have in general more to them than meets the eye so feel free to share your theories, new or old, on which characters in ASOIAF you think have secret identities and how they'll play into the future of the series.

I'll start with a few;

* R+L=J, this one is a fan favourite for decades now that Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark which makes a lot of sense.

* A+A=D, I keep going back and forth on whether I think Aerys or Rhaegar is Daenerys' daughter but I'm 100% convinced Daenerys' true mother is actually Ashara Dayne and the reason why the Daynes have so much respect for Ned Stark despite him killing Arthur Dayne is that he helped fake Ashara's death and smuggle the baby Daenerys out of Westeros then pretended that Jon Snow was actually Ashara's baby.

* Alleras = Sarella Sand, one of the Sand Snakes.

* The Gravedigger on the Quiet Isle = Sandor Clegane.

* The Elder Brother on the Quiet Isle = Lewyn Martell, former member of Aerys' Kingsguard who fought at the Battle of the Trident alongside Robert. I read a great fan theory months ago about Lewyn being the Elder Brother and having an affair with Genna Lannister had me convinced and intrigued.

* Lem Lemoncloak = Richard Lonmouth, another character who can give further credence to R+L=J.

There's so many other great fan theories out there like the idea some of Tywin's children are secret Targaryens, that Brandon Stark has secret Stark bastards out in the North somewhere etc. so feel free to share them here if you believe them!",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Which characters do you believe have secret identities?
367,"I was watching AltShiftX's [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M1RHHj6NcHk) on House Dayne and how it'll save Planetos. There, he made some interesting observations.

He said (and I'm paraphrasing a bit here) that House Dayne represents GRRM's childhood memories when he was all innocent; when knights were gallant and righteous, ladies were beautiful and intelligent and the times were generally so much simpler. He said Arthur and Ashara Dayne epitomised that feeling of years gone by, and I completely agree. 

It kinda got me thinking about another aspect of a simple kids' fable: the vile villainous evil villain, whose only motivation is being evil and cruel to the hero (behind a lazy excuse, of course). And for that, I have the perfect candidate: Hoster Tully.

Now, we know Hoster as a kind man, a good father to Cat and a man of good conscience, although slightly power-hungry. Someone like Lysa will know him as the man who forbade her love and instead married her off to a man old enough to be her grandfather, far away from home.

If you think about it, the whole thing is the plot of a Disney Princess movie where the villain won. As we all know, George loves to subvert tropes and established story models. Princess meets and falls in love with common boy, they hang around for a bit, the princess's father finds out and he's not happy. He forbids the princess from seeing the boy (at least he didn't lock her up in a tower or something). She does anyway, and gets pregnant with his baby. The angry father forces her to get an abortion, then carts her off to said old man. Where have I seen this before? 
This is, of course, only Lysa's perspective. The truth is far more complicated, like every other truth in this series.

We see that Hoster regretted his actions and died a slow, guilt-full death. So I guess, according to the fairy-tale model, he got what he deserved. This turned out to be a tragedic play!",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] GRRM's childhood and Disney villains
369,"A lot of ink has been spilled over how Northerners survive years of winter. Between organization, agriculture, large storage areas, trade with the South, Winterfell's glass gardens and hot springs, I can see how it might be feasible.

Nevertheless, in spite all this, the North surely takes a population hit in their Winters with all these advantages learned over thousands of years. With that in mind, how could primitive Wildlings facing an even colder winter survive at all without these advantages?

Wildlings are mostly pastoral, lack meaningful infrastructure, and no significant form of agriculture. Yes, they have meat sources, but I would imagine wildlife populations are in free-fall after a year of winter and even when you get the meat, I imagine it’s not easy to light a fire in the dead of years of winter.

You'd think a three year winter would just about wipe out any population north of the Wall.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) How do Wildlings possibly survive Winter?
371,"I will be calling this a hypothesis instead of a theory because most ideas posited as theories are actually hypotheses although in our vernacular, it might be called a theory.

It is a possible explanation for things we have observed things in the books that show this explanation to be possible.  If TWOW is published and reveals further evidence for this explanation, I will proudly call it a theory...

Here goes:

I posit that the Faceless men are putting Arya through training exercises, but the exercises are not only intended for her.  They are intended for The Waif.as well.  

For Arya, these exercises are to prepare her to become an acolyte of the House of Black and White.

For The Waif, they serve a different purpose.  When Arya becomes No One, The Waif is to travel to Westeros under the guise of Arya Stark.

The most perfect is “the lying game” where The Waif would gain critical information about Arya’s former life in Westeros so that she can get her story straight before hand.  It would be critical, when interacting with those who knew her for a seamless character to be performed.  Under The Waif’s tutelage, she would be revealing even her smallest mannerisms.  
Her assignments would also reveal how she would act in certain situations.

Another curious indicator is that she has Arya teach her the common tongue first instead of teaching Arya the tongue of the Braavosi.  Instead Arya tasked with learning it all by herself.  This would make sense if it were more urgent for The Waif to learn Arya’s language, dialect, and accent.  Arya would, of course, be teaching the Northern dialect that she is familiar with.

There are a number of reasons why The Waif would be the best candidate to wear Arya’s face.  First and foremost is her stature.  The Waif is almost an identical match for Arya as her body is concerned,  and seems to have the body of a girl Arya’s age.


This is not to be confused with the postulation that Arya is going to die and be replaced.  I see no evidence for that, but I do postulate that The Waif is meant to impersonate her in Westeros.

373,"I’m sure this has been posted before, and I understand Ned’s character and why this constitutes a *gray* area in his moral schema, but I have to wonder:

Considering how, within the span of a small conversation, he directly contradicts himself and makes it clear to Jaime that there is simply no way for him to “win,” do you think Ned is even remotely *aware* of how silly he sounds, or how contradictory he’s being?

Like I said - I *understand* why he says what he says and thinks what he thinks. But I wonder if there’s anymore nuance to the fact that no reasonable person couldn’t at least acknowledge the hypocrisy in this line of thinking, or at least admit that he’s only being so unreasonable because he simply doesn’t like the Kingslayer.

“You did nothing to save my brother and father, you just stood there.” -&gt; “You served him well, when serving was safe.”

[Spoilers MAIN]"
376,"This is just a theory based on unintended circumstantial evidence provided by GRRM &amp; The Mercy chapter from the yet to be released *the Winds of Winter*. 

&amp;#x200B;

While going over my other theory regarding an element of fire magic being present in TWOW prologue, it occurred to me that perhaps we may have already stumbled upon a subtle clue about a certain Chekhov's Wolf Pack being involved as well.

For those who do not know, GRRM has confirmed that a certain Jeyne Westerling will appear in TWOW prologue. Now, this does not in any way mean that she will be the POV, just that she will be in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that confirmation by GRRM, many theorists have speculated that Jeyne's prisoner convoy will be attacked by the Brotherhood without Banners in an attempt to rescue Edmure, Jeyne, and whoever else they can. Who the POV character is has been up for debate for awhile, but I speculate that the prologue POV will not be important, the events that surround them will be.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the good part. For those of you who don't know, the Mercy chapter actually included a spoiler regarding the one and only Cersei Lannister. Harys Swyft is in Bravos attempting to negotiate a new loan from the Iron Bank, at the behest of Cersei.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “How long do you think we’ll be here?”   
&gt;  
&gt; “Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head.""  

&amp;#x200B;

Cersei has apparently survived her trial and we can assume that Margaery Tyrell most likely did as well. While Cersei surviving her trial and ruling the kingdom is a spoiler, it is an expected outcome for many of us. The true spoiler involves Arya's warging.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.   
&gt;  
&gt; The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran. 

&amp;#x200B;

For you attentive readers, this is a big ole helping of information. Arya's wolf dreams have been telling us what Nymeria has been up to and where she is, the Riverlands. She pulled Cat's corpse from the river, she had been leading a huge pack of wolves, and most importantly, she has been attacking Arya's enemies. And yes, Bran is also there watching her, but he isn't really relevant to the theory. 

&amp;#x200B;

The details***:***

* Jeyne Westerling is confirmed to be in TWOW prologue
* Jeyne is a prisoner of the Lannisters along with Edmure Tully, they are traveling in a Lannister prisoner convoy to Casterly Rock
* The BwB know where the convoy is heading, how many there are, and who is with them
* Nymeria's wolf pack has been in the region attacking Arya's enemies

&amp;#x200B;

***My theory is that the Brotherhood without Banners, led by Lady Stoneheart, will attack the prisoner convoy in an attempt to rescue the prisoners and during the fighting Nymeria's wolf pack will intervene (an unexpected 3rd army turning the tides of battle is a common plot device in the story) and help destroy the Lannister army.***

***I believe that Arya's wolf dream in the Mercy chapter was an unintended clue that informed us that Nymeria's wolf pack was part of prologue battle and Arya awoke to the aftermath of it happening.***",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) TWOW Spoiler Theory for Mercy: The Chekhov's Spoiler &amp; The Red Herring Spoiler

389,"Before I begin, I’m gonna admit that this does utilize some aspects of the show, so I’m sorry.

So I’ll start with Jon. He’s arguably the main hero of this story. Like Frodo, he’s the only one who’s really directly facing the main threat while everyone else is on their own quests until much later when they all gather together to face the one enemy. Also like Frodo, Jon has been stabbed. While Jon obviously dies, you could argue that Frodo almost dies and is about to slip into shadow. Both are saved from some form of magic. At the end of their stories, a great burden is placed on them right after seemingly relieving themselves of a previous great burden (Jon kills Dany, Frodo is without the Ring which makes him suffer withdrawal and essentially depression). This causes both to leave their old lives to be at peace away from civilization, where they may find some little happiness for themselves.

Samwell is Samwise. Both obviously share a name and both are essentially the rocks of our protagonists. Both are a little on the fat side and scared, Samwell fat more so, but eventually have moments of badassery. At one point, both go off on their own to do something to help the hero and come back for the final fight that they and their hero friend suffer through together. Both have a family at the end of the story and say goodbye to their best friend that they’ve gone through so much toil with.

397,"Many readers of *A Song of Ice and Fire* seem to believe argue that GRRM is violating the conventions and formulas of the fantasy genre left and right, slaying the archetypes and tropes of not only the genre itself, but also that of heroic fiction and myth. 

I’d like to make a case that this couldn’t be further from the truth and, while the author is certainly applying a very fresh and new spin on the genre and archetypes, he’s not violated one trope in the telling of his tale thus far. What follows are the primary tropes of fantasy fiction literature. 

**Setting :**
&gt;A world other than ours. It may have a nominal connection with present day Earth, such as being our remote past or future, but this plays no role in the plot. Mythopoeia is often put into play to define the very metaphysics of the world. Nevertheless it often resembles medieval Europe, and is often peopled by People of Hair Color.

— TV Tropes

Check. The planet in which ASOIAF is told is not earth. Futhermore it resembles medieval Europe, hair color is a critical factor throughout in the story, most especially in Eddard determining that Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are bastards born of incest, and Mythopoeia is well established in the lore throughout the tale. 

**Scale :**
&gt;Epic. Power politics, wars, the death of nations, gods walking the earth, and the real threat of The End of the World as We Know It. This is what distinguishes High Fantasy from Heroic Fantasy.

— TV Tropes

Check. Power politics and wars are factors throughout the plot, the existential threat of the Others “ending the world as we know it” is established from the beginning, and the story is truly epic in scale. 

**Great Evil :**
&gt;An enemy which is near enough Evil incarnate or fundamentally abhorrent, as opposed to the Grey and Gray Morality and human-versus-human conflicts more common in Low Fantasy.

— TV Tropes

Check. While we have yet to fully understand the motives of the Others, from the perspective of our characters and their POV chapters the Others are “evil” and “fundamentally abhorrent”, most especially in that they raise and wight the dead for their armies. Martin *also* upholds the low fantasy trope of grey moralities and human VS human conflict. Double whammy. 

**Magic and Powers**
&gt;Functional Magic is almost always present, though its role in the world can vary widely. It might be either respected, feared, persecuted, or simply not believed in. Its frequency varies from the stuff of legend, through to rare but available to the well connected, up to a ubiquitous part of everyday life. Magitek usually lies at the extreme end of this scale. It may be taught through a master and apprentice system, or in a magical university, when it can be taught at all. When wizards are immortal, they don't need to train successors, and may not be able to.

— TV Tropes

Check. Magic is present throughout the world of ASOIAF and in-world is definitely “respected, feared, persecuted, or simply not believed in” - all four. A master and apprentice system is seen in the relationship between Bloodraven and Bran, and we also have notions of academies in the Red Temple, Assshai, and in its own way The Citadel. 

**Methods :**
&gt;Victory is not achieved through force of arms, the main feature distinguishing High Fantasy from Heroic Fantasy. If Aragorn had killed Sauron in hand-to-hand combat, that would have been Heroic Fantasy. In short, a Supporting Leader or the Reluctant Hero will be offered up instead of the rough-hewn barbarian of, say, Conan the Barbarian or Beowulf.

— TV Tropes

While we have yet to see the end of ASOIAF, it’s very reasonable to speculate that the manner in which the Others will be defeated will not be so simple and straightforward as the HBO show - greenseer Bran will likely have a very large role to play in the weirnet. Regardless, the reluctant hero tropes are very much upheld in the story via both Jon and Dany, as well as Bran in his own manner also. 

___
A final note because so many seem to believe Martin has committed the gravest of sins against the mother of all tropes in killing the hero or main protagonist off at or near the beginning of the story - he hasn’t. 

While we have a few protagonist characters who are all on the path of the archetypal Hero’s Journey, most especially Jon and Dany, more than any other that character is Bran - we begin with his story as the first POV chapter following the prologue in *A Game of Thrones*, his plot is progressing through the Journey stage by stage as laid out by Joseph Campbell, and he’ll be King when the tale is complete - this is textbook monomyth. 

What other tropes do you believe the author has slain? I bet if we look closer he’s not done so, but rather has bent them a bit and put fresh spins on ancient archetypes and fantasy motifs, by no means breaking them but rather upholding them and casting all in a new light, or darkness.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] George R.R.

Woman in Black

&gt;As I stared at her, stared until my eyes ached in their sockets, stared in surprise and bewilderment at her presence, now I saw that her face did wear an expression. It was one of what I can only describe—and the words seem hopelessly inadequate to express what I saw—as a desperate, yearning malevolence; it was as though she were searching for something she wanted, needed—must have, more than life itself, and which had been taken from her.

I'll start with the Iron Throne. It is a simple idea but instantly became iconic. The swords of the kings who bowed to Aegon the Conqueror were melted and bound together to make a badass throne. Like it doesn't get any more stylistic than that. Also something the show did translate well is that the Iron Throne is really dangerous. Not only is the design simplified, but the idea that the ruler's seat can physically cut and bleed the King is very powerful. There is this theme that the King of Westeros can be destroyed by the throne itself.

**Will (AGOT, Prologue)**

At the end of the AGOT, Prologue, Will is attacked by Ser Waymar who has turned into a wight. While Waymar was in fact killed by an Other(s) it remains possible that Will was resurrected after he died.

&gt;The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold. -AGOT, Prologue

**Chett (ASOS, Prologue)**

After plotting to kill the Old Bear and desert, Chett is killed shortly after the ASOS, Prologue on/near the Fist:

&gt;The sound went on and on and on, until it seemed it would never die. The ravens were flapping and screaming, flying about their cages and banging off the bars, and all about the camp the brothers of the Night's Watch were rising, donning their armor, buckling on swordbelts, reaching for battleaxes and bows. Samwell Tarly stood shaking, his face the same color as the snow that swirled down all around them. ""Three,"" he squeaked to Chett, ""that was three, I heard three. They never blow three. Not for hundreds and thousands of years. Three means—""

&gt;""—Others."" Chett made a sound that was half a laugh and half a sob, and suddenly his smallclothes were wet, and he could feel the piss running down his leg, see steam rising off the front of his breeches. -ASOS, Prologue

as we see him later in a Sam chapter:

&gt;She stood with her back against the weirwood, the boy in her arms. The wights were all around her. There were a dozen of them, a score, more . . . some had been wildlings once, and still wore skins and hides . . . but more had been his brothers. Sam saw Lark the Sisterman, Softfoot, Ryles. **The wen on Chett's neck was black, his boils covered with a thin film of ice.** And that one looked like Hake, though it was hard to know for certain with half his head missing. They had torn the poor garron apart, and were pulling out her entrails with dripping red hands. Pale steam rose from her belly. -ASOS, Samwell III

The Alchemist/Jaqen H'gar takes Pate's ""face"" after getting access to the universal key of the Citadel (presumably after *The Death of Dragons*) but we later see Pater interact with Sam (in a manner in which the real ""Pate"" despises):

&gt;""My thanks."" There was something about the pale, soft youth that he misliked, but he did not want to seem discourteous, so he added, ""My name's not Slayer, truly. I'm Sam. Samwell Tarly.""

Then he found himself rushing over moonlit snows with his packmates close behind him. Half the world was dark. One Eye, he knew. He bayed, and Sly and Stalker gave echo. -ADWD, Prologue

Kevan is killed by Varys (and his little birds) basically so we can get an info dump about fAegon. I think it can be assumed Kevan will stay dead. That said Qyburn is in the Red Keep.

&gt;  
&gt;Daenerys II ADWD

So it's believed by fandom that in this quote Quaithe means that sun's son is Quentyn Martell. He's a son, his sigil is a sun and he has gone to meet Daenerys. 

Back in AGOT MMD gives Dany a prophecy about Drogo. 

&gt;""When will he be as he was?"" Dany demanded.  
&gt;  
&gt;""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Daenerys IX AGOT

We again see a ""sun"" in a prophecy. Sun that rises (which may also mean: is born, grews up, start a journey) in the west and sets (gets older, dies) in the east. Here we see a correlation between MMD's sun and Quaithe's (MMD= Quaithe confirmed lmao). Does it mean that Quentyn's death was foreshadowed already in the very first book?

Analising further MMD's prophecy; Drogo will return when seas go dry. In the last Dany's chapter in ADWD she notices:

&gt;Though she walked through a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer. Even here autumn made its presence felt, and winter would not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a wan and sickly green on the verge of going yellow. **After that would come brown. The grass was dying.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Daenerys X ADWD  
&gt;  
&gt;“**I am lost at sea**,” she said as she limped along beside her meandering rivulet, “so perhaps I’ll find some crabs, or a nice fat fish.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Daenerys X ADWD

The grass in dothraki sea is dying, it dries up. 

The last part of the prophecy is about next Dany's child. Dany would have to get pregnent before Drogo would return to her. In this quote below she thinks the blood she finds is moon blood.

&gt;When she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood. For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I’m so tired. She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep. Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass, **and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Daenerys X ADWD

However many theorize that she actually was pregnent but after eating some funny berries she miscarried.

So when will Drogo return? He already did! Well... not exactly. 

A crucial point in this ""theory"" is that the personalities of Dany's dragons have to be somehow tied to their namesakes. I read somewhere that Viserys was a mommy's boy, that Rhaella protected him and really took care of him. If Viserion took some beheviours from Viserys it has to be this, because he also shows his loves to his mommy, he likes to cuddle. (However it doesnt really match that well or well enough with Rhaegar and Rhaegal.)  So we may assume that Drogon is somehow Drogo reborn. Well...at least methaphorically.

What are your thoughts about this?",asoiaf,"[Spoilers Main] Again about the Sun's Son, Drogo, Drogon and prophecy"
424,"Aemon Targeryen is the most possible name as this has been foreshadowed a lot.

But I think considering background scenario it is more possible that Jon's birth name is Viscerys amd not Aemon.

From the knowledge that we have right now, Rheagar was this prophecy obsessed man. Now if we don't get more information about him and his reason to abduct Lyanna other than completing the prophecy of PTWP, it's pretty possible that he just thought his third child was going to be a girl with 100% guarantee and not a boy. Considering this , Rheagar might have thought of "" Visenya Targeryen"" only and not considered the possibility of naming a boy child. And when Lyanna found out it was a boy, considering her situation she might not in a condition to think a proper Targeryen name.   


There is a possibility that She would give Jon a stark name but if that's the case I don't see a reason to rename Jon from Ned's perspective.


There is another possibility that Lyanna died before naming Jon this making Jon his birth name only.

Or She might call him Viscerys from Visceneya. As remembering Rheagar's brother name would be much easier for her than remembering his great grandfather's brother name unless and until Rheagar had mentioned it to her.



It could also mean that Name that Rheagar took while dying in the Dany's vision of House of Black and White was actually Visenya.  

It could also show us the rift that might be between Dany and Jon as he will be the second Viscerys in her life. 


It's just one of my tinfoil as I don't have any textual evidence to back it up while there has been foreshadowing for Aemon Targeryen to be his birth name. I am just thinking of real time scenario that might have went down at TOJ with the current knowledge that I have.

In an attempt to frame Aegon III's former hand Thaddeus Rowan for his own crimes, he subjected the man to Theon Greyjoy levels of torture.

He had been so strongly conditioned to plead guilty to any crime laid against him that he ended up confessing to the murder of a man who was still alive, as well as to the literal Doom of Valyria.

451,"I’ve just reread the scene in Game where Viserys receives his golden crown. It’s an amazing scene and I love it every time but this time something new stood out for me. 

Viserys refers to Rhaego as a bastard. 

&gt; Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I'm taking you back. You and the eggs both. He can keep his bloody foal. **I'll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.** “The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her brother.


On first read it comes across as just a throwaway insult but I think there’s more to it than that. 

On their journey across the Dothraki Sea, Viserys makes it abundantly clear (in almost *every* interaction) that he considers the Dothraki to be savages. 

&gt; ""I suppose,"" her brother said doubtfully. ""The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep …""


&gt; ""All these savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built … and kill."" He laughed. ""They do know how to kill. Otherwise I'd have no use for them at all.""


&gt; ""See, the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men.""


He has absolutely *zero* regard for *any* of their beliefs, customs, or traditions. 

&gt; ""The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen …""

&gt; “The crones, yes,"" her brother interrupted, ""and there's to be some mummer's show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly, you told me. What is that to me? I'm tired of eating horsemeat and I'm sick of the stink of these savages.""

He considers Dothraki ceremonies to be no more significant than a mummer’s show. *Including their marriage ceremonies*. 

As far as Viserys is concerned he has not sold Danaery’s hand, he’s just sold her maidenhood. Drogo gets Rhaego, a son of dragonblood, who can rule his Khalasar after him, and in return Viserys gets his 10,000 screamers. 

He was most likely still planning on taking Dany with him to Westeros and marrying her for real (in his eyes) himself. 

Viserys is very like his father in his obsession with “the blood of the dragon”. Aerys didn’t want Rhaegar to water down the blood and I think Viserys would feel the same way about his own dragon blood.

This is just a small rant in defense of Sansa, produced after reading Sansa III in ACOK. Many people see Sansa's arc in AFFC as her spy training to become a master player of the game of thrones. I do believe Littlefinger will perfect her skills (to hopefully his demise), but her training started with Catelyn. Catelyn, who raised her as a lady to hide away her true emotions when addressing nobles, one skill that is desperately in need coming ACOK. 

The two quotes that open this post are from Sansa III in ACOK, way before Littlefinger captures Sansa and initiates her on the road down Alayne. First Sandor, then Tyrion compliment her on the ability to always say pleasing things to Lannister's ears, with no hesitation, even after being punched and humiliated in front of the whole court. Who taught Sansa to lie so well? Catelyn, Septa Mordane, Winterfell, the Starks. Sansa is a major player even before going to the Vale, as she's been preparing for it ever since she was a small child. Many readers find her story boring or hate her for her actions (she is, like, twelve?), but she is a true badass who survived King's Landing while her dad was eaten alive by it. 

If she is to be Queen in the North, it will only be a satisfying conclusion to her arc in the series. I hope she outsmarts Littlefing and directly topple him down. But whatever her fate, it's safe to say she will be on top in the end.",asoiaf,[Spoilers MAIN] Who taught Sansa?

459,"So we know from GRRM's words that he wants the ending to be bitter sweet. So I have two personal theories about how that ending could come about. Lots of time skipping and lack of filler ahead. 

1. Daenarys arrives in Westeros and is able to defeat her enemies and accidentally sets off the wildfire below Kings Landing. This forces her into an arrangement with fAegon or Jon in order to keep her there without a revolt. When the Others arrive she assists in the battle but at the end of it all she is broken, either mentally or physically from her life's ordeals. Whether this includes most/all of the dragons dying is up in the air. She is exiled by King fAegon/Jon to Braavos to live out her days. Daenarys in the books says that she was most happiest when she was in Braavos. It would be bitter sweet because she finally returned home and helped restore her family to the throne but in return she was broken but in the end sailed back across the sea (ala Frodo) to go back to where she remembers being happiest. It could even end with fAegon or Jon discovering a clutch of dragon eggs about to hatch on Dragonstone. 
2. Daenarys comes home and she becomes pregnant with the child of either fAegon or Jon and after all is said and done she dies in childbirth but gives birth to a baby girl. Jon is duty bound to care for the child, giving a callback to Lyana and Ned and if Jon is on the Iron Throne then again we have this bittersweet ending where Daenarys was able to have a child, Jon has a legitimate son and the Targaryens are back on the throne (could be secret if Jon reveals his true family) but that Daenarys didn't get to see it but that her daughter will. Again could discover dragon eggs or have two of the dragons survive, one for Jon and the other for his daughter when she is old enough. 

Just something I threw together so its not perfectly well written but its the basic ideas lol What do you think?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Some pet theories about how the books will end
461,"As title tell, I would love to know which theories you don't like, even if they most probably are true.

That's my list:

1) Rhaegar+Lyanna=Jon. To the truth I can't get myself to like this scenario. I understand that a ""Game of Thrones"" was originally written as first part of trilogy and that why so many clues about Jon's parentage was puted into this book. If you would ask me, when I read a books the first time topic of Jon parentage was something what never interested me - there was so more interesting stuff. If this is main mystery of the story - as original Martin's outline claim - I feel dissapointed.

2) Jon's ressurection. Again Jon... I like the guy but I don't feel he should came back. I know, I know... There was foreshadowing for it. Many foreshadowing. But I feel he screw up as Lord Commander. That can be weird but he isolated himself from his people and that's main reason of his fall. I remember some Arya's memories about Ned and how he knew his people. Ned discussed which each of them every day because he knew that the lord must know his people. Jon didn't do that. Ressurecting Jon feel like this don't matter he make mistakes.

3) Others are evil. That just to simple for me. They didn't attacked from 6-8 thousands years and now they decided to eliminate humanity?

4) Joffrey send catspaw. It's feel weird that assassin don't take this silver bag and VALYRIAN STEEL KNIFE and just ignore Joffrey command when Joffrey leave Winterfell. He could literally sell this knife and get more money. How could Joffrey punish him for not killing Bran when prince wasn't in Winterfell?

5) Aegon is Blackfyre. I just don't like this Jon Connington didn't realise the truth. Guy who loved Rhaegar!

6) Azor Ahai Reborn is savior of the world. There is many dark stuff surrounding this figure but most probably GRRM just add that to make this savior more grey. For me AAR sound more like apostle of fire apocalypce than the savior but maybe that just me.

I know fostering your son with another family is pretty common but they typically have a reason behind it like Quentyn to settle an issue in Dorne or Robin Arryn because his Father died.  Robert's father had died when Robert was about 15 (I think) so maybe that was part of why he was sent to the Vale?  But I am curious why both Brandon and Ned were sent away to be fostered.

463,"I have a question regarding bastards in ASOIAF. This contains no big spoilers but a question that popped into my head regarding bastards. 

Bastards in A Song of Ice and Fire, as we all know, have different surnames from their parents true surnames. Example: 

Crownlands: Waters
Dorne: Sand
Iron Islands: Pyke 
North: Snow
Reach: Flowers
Riverlands: Rivers
Stormlands: Storm
Vale of Arryn: Stone
Westernlands: Hill
Targaryen Bastards: Blackfrye

However, when a bastard naturally gets married to say another bastard or (especially) someone with a true surname/family does the child inherit said bastard’s surname or do they create their own family name? This question is especially for male bastards marrying someone from noble birth, or a natural birth. 

For example: Say Jon Snow is Ned Stark’s bastard and not R+L = J. And he married into a noble or somewhat noble family or just a regular family. Would he inherit the family’s name he married into? Would his child inherit the name Snow? Or would the child inherit the mothers surname?

Granted... it is rare, I believe, for a bastard to marry into one of these Houses / homes due to bastards cannot inherit their family’s lands, titles, etc etc unless they are legitimized or there is no heir for the child to receive these inheritances. And other families see no purpose to marry their children to bastards since they cannot gain anything from the marriage. 

Just curious. Thanks all.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) What’s in a name???

The Night's Watch is old. Much older than we think. (I've read a quote from a Cotf who says they were installed even before the first Men).

468,"Among all the mysteries laying on the fringe of the world created by GRRM, 2 are both particularly intriguing and IMO a bit neglected by most theories : the origin of the High Tower and the History of the alchemists. In appearance, these are complete different matters . However, I might have found a link between the 2 which hasn’t been covered prior this post (at least as far as I know).

**1) The Black Stone Fortress :** **the most mysterious building in Westeros.**

**The High Tower, seat of House Hightower, is one the oldest building of Westeros. The structure is in 2 parts :**

**- the base, which is an ancient fortress made of black stone (and therefore known as the Black Stone Fortress).**

\- the actual tower, which serves both as a residence for the Hightowers **and as a beacon for the ships sailing to Oldtown.**

According to legend, Uthor of the High Tower, founder of House Hightower, asked Brandon the Builder to erect a stone tower where he only had a timber one. **However, the Black Stone Fortress seems even older than that.** On the matter of its origin, the maesters are reduced to speculations, while the smallfolk believe that it just appeared at some point, **which suggests that it might predates the arrival of the First Men themselves.**

The architecture of the building is even more interesting. As I wrote, it is made of **black stone, similar in appearance to the fused black stone used by the Valyrians** to build their roads or the famous Walls of Volantis. **This strongly suggests that whoever built the BSF had access to advanced pyromancy and/or possessed dragons.**

However, the buidling doesn’t look like Dragonstone or other structures created by the Dragonlords of Valyria : the BSF doesn’t have any ornament on the outside, and the interior seems to be **designed like a** **labyrinth** for some reason. The BSF isn't the only mysterious labyrinthine construct on Planetos, and as far as I know, **their original function is still unknown.**

**2)** **The Guildhall of the Alchemists:** **King’s Landing’s wildfire factory**

**The Alchemist’s Guild is an ancient order of pyromancers.** Its members know the secret recipe of wildfire, which they call “the substance”. According to Tyrion Lannister, the Guild was once a powerful organization, but was supplanted by the Citadel centuries ago. Unlike most of the maesters, the alchemists still believe in magic, and their activities revolve around secret knowledge. However, the current members of the Guild are not exactly displaying mind-blowing abilities like the red priests do.

The center of their activities seems to be the Guildhall of the Alchemists which is located at the bottom of Visenya’s Hill in King’s Landing. **This is the place where they are producing and storing wildfire.** In ACOK Tyrion visits the place, **which is described as an underground labyrinthine structure made of black stone.** Near the entrance, is the Gallery of the Iron Torches. That part of the building is covered in marble and has columns of black iron that can be ignited with wildfire in order to impress the visitor. Wisdom Hallyne, the Great Master of the Guild, tells him that **the whole place has been designed to prevent any risk of major incident if a jar accidentally explodes.** For example, if a storage cell takes flame, the ceiling is supposed to crumble and bury the fire under a massive amount of sand.

**3)** **Similar design = similar function ?**

**So, we have 2 buildings, both created by pyromancers, made of black stone and described as labyrinthine.** Based on  Tyrion’s chapter in ACOK, we can’t establish that the “black stone” from the galleries of the Guildhall is actually “fused black stone” rather that just the natural stone from King’s Landing underground. However, black seems to be the dominant color in all parts of the building, even the (above ground) Gallery of Iron Torches. **The alchemists wanted the Guildhall to be “all black”. Plus, the labyrinthine structure of their building is explained by its very function.** Wildfire is so unstable that you can’t simply store it in one big hall. You have to store it in a lot of small cells, each having a safety mechanism to prevent any fire to spread in the whole structure. This mechanism involve a room full of sand above each storing cell. **As a result, the Guildhall is, to date, the only building which “labyrinthine” structure actually makes sense within the saga.** That’s why I think that the similarities between the GoA and the BSF aren’t pure coincidence. **Both structures look the same because they had the same primary function : produce and store wildfire !!**

An indirect hint reinforcing the idea of a link between the BSF and wildfire is the way the beacon is used nowadays : according to “Fire and Blood”, the Hightowers can change the color of its flame. **When they want to call the banners they turn it green.** Green is conveniently the color of the House itself, but a green flame also means a much higher temperature than a classical fire. **Within the saga the only fire that happens to be green is the one produced by the combustion of… wildfire !**

**4) A gateway to even more tinfoil theories !**

You might already disagree with my conclusions at this point, that’s why I want to know what you think of it, and what arguments you might have against it (any constructive criticism will be appreciated). However, you have to know this idea was for me the starting point of much wilder speculations, because **if you are ready to admit that the BSF was built by pyromancers in order to create wildfire, an awful lot of new questions will inevitably pop up inside your mind, such as:**  

**- Who were those pyromancers, where did they come from ?**

**- Why did they come there specifically, and why did they need wildfire ?**

**- Is the Guild of Alchemists linked to the BSF, and if so, in which way ?**

**- In which way are the Maesters of the Citadel actually connected to the BSF (Peremore’s pets I’m looking at you) ?**

**- Where do House Hightower comes into all this ?**

I’ve got several hypothesis about all this, which, all together, happen to create a storyline that would impact no less that the whole History of Planetos.

That’s why I will save them for future posts (hopefully).",asoiaf,In the Shadow of the High Tower 1/? : the Black Stone Fortress and the Guildhall of the Alchemists.
469,"Among  all the mysteries laying on the fringe of the world created by GRRM, 2  are both particularly intriguing and IMO a bit neglected by most  theories : the origin of the High Tower and the History of the  alchemists. In appearance, these are complete different matters .  However, I might have found a link between the 2 which hasn’t been  covered prior this post (at least as far as I know).

**1) The Black Stone Fortress :** **the most mysterious building in Westeros.**

**The High Tower, seat of House Hightower, is one the oldest building of Westeros. The structure is in 2 parts :**

**- the base, which is an ancient fortress made of black stone (and therefore known as the Black Stone Fortress).**

\- the actual tower, which serves both as a residence for the Hightowers **and as a beacon for the ships sailing to Oldtown.**

According  to legend, Uthor of the High Tower, founder of House Hightower, asked  Brandon the Builder to erect a stone tower where he only had a timber  one. **However, the Black Stone Fortress seems even older than that.**  On the matter of its origin, the maesters are reduced to speculations,  while the smallfolk believe that it just appeared at some point, **which suggests that it might predates the arrival of the First Men themselves.**

The architecture of the building is even more interesting. As I wrote, it is made of **black stone, similar in appearance to the fused black stone used by the Valyrians** to build their roads or the famous Walls of Volantis. **This strongly suggests that whoever built the BSF had access to advanced pyromancy and/or possessed dragons.**

However,  the buidling doesn’t look like Dragonstone or other structures created  by the Dragonlords of Valyria : the BSF doesn’t have any ornament on the  outside, and the interior seems to be **designed like a** **labyrinth** for some reason. The BSF isn't the only mysterious labyrinthine construct on Planetos, and as far as I know, **their original function is still unknown.**

**2)** **The Guildhall of the Alchemists:** **King’s Landing’s wildfire factory**

**The Alchemist’s Guild is an ancient order of pyromancers.**  Its members know the secret recipe of wildfire, which they call “the  substance”. According to Tyrion Lannister, the Guild was once a powerful  organization, but was supplanted by the Citadel centuries ago. Unlike  most of the maesters, the alchemists still believe in magic, and their  activities revolve around secret knowledge. However, the current members  of the Guild are not exactly displaying mind-blowing abilities like the  red priests do.

The center of  their activities seems to be the Guildhall of the Alchemists which is  located at the bottom of Visenya’s Hill in King’s Landing. **This is the place where they are producing and storing wildfire.** In ACOK Tyrion visits the place, **which is described as an underground labyrinthine structure made of black stone.**  Near the entrance, is the Gallery of the Iron Torches. That part of the  building is covered in marble and has columns of black iron that can be  ignited with wildfire in order to impress the visitor. Wisdom Hallyne,  the Great Master of the Guild, tells him that **the whole place has been designed to prevent any risk of major incident if a jar accidentally explodes.**  For example, if a storage cell takes flame, the ceiling is supposed to  crumble and bury the fire under a massive amount of sand.

**3)** **Similar design = similar function ?**

471,"On my first read of AFFC. I just finished Cersei’s chapter where she has to attend Tywins wake. In the chapter she also appoints Rosby as Master of Coin, much to Lord Maces dismay. She talks with Qyburn about the Mountain and the missing gaoler. But the best part of the chapter is at the end where she sits down to eat and discuss terms with her uncle Kevan. 

And shit, I have a massive newfound respect for Uncle Kev. He gets right to the point. He denies Hand of the King Bc Cersei wont return to Casterly Rock. He tells her she is not her father. He tells her she is “as unfit a mother as (she) is ruler” because of his experiences with and observations of Joffrey. When Cersei said she was in grief when she asked Jaime “a fool” to be hand first, kevan asks “what does that make you?” And lastly, after rejecting all propositions, he says “Tommen has his mother”.... “and his father, too, I think” 

BOOM. ROASTED. This mf got some BALLS on him. I love it. He walked right into her room, rejected her, insulted her, and then accused her of incest. UNCLE KEV KEEP BEING YOU.",asoiaf,Kevan Lannister

474,"So if any of you arw familiar with my username (probably not) you know I got into the books recently after the show ended. I am at the very end of ADWD, milking it slowly for fear of having no more ASOIAF and dreading the wait for Winds. I am currently on the chapter 'The Queens Hand'. Only a few pages into the Barristans POV chapter and I started to openly weep. I haven't done that really at all through the books. Maybe once or twice but I can't recall. The show yes. But not the books. Until this. And I am not sure why. I had just finished Quentyns death. The covers are pulled over him and Barristan tells Missandei to get some sleep. She tells him to do the same, if she may be so bold because he does not sleep the whole night through. He reflects to himself how he hasn't for many years. Not since the Trident. That he is afraid at this age any sleep could be his last. And it was about there that I began to cry. I am not quite sure exactly why. Maybe the death of Quentyn seemed so wasteful and pointless? A young man dying in his prime for foolishness. Or perhaps the fact of Barristans deep sadness lasting for 20 years or more since the Trident. Perhaps the pain he felt for failing Rhaegar, Aerys, Elia, Aegon and Rhaenys? Maybe his loss of never telling Ashara Dayne his love for her? Or maybe I think his line about not waking up at that age. My mother is at that age and I worry about her not waking up? Or maybe a combo of it all, I wonder? I've been having a lot of family drama going on as of late. My sisters special needs child whom I have been raising as my own is at the center of a custody dispute with her biological father. My sister was sentenced to 2-7 years state prison. My family is devastated by it all. On top of that I have a bad cold which is making me feel off. Maybe its all of it combined. Or just the mastery of GRRM's writing ability to put us in the shoes and head of a man who has seen all too much death and betrayal and full of regrets to save the ones he cares about. Who just lost his Queen and witness the kin of one of his fallen Kingsguard brothers die a most gruesome and painful death. Who is at the age he should be basking in retirement, grandchildren and glory of old tales to be regaled at feasts and celebrations. Instead he is failing all over again. And for that character who felt so real in that moment I openly wept. And also realized what assholes D&amp;D were for killing off Selmy and lauging at Ian McElhhineys pleas for staying on the show. 

What scenes in the books have really gotten to you and made you cry or emotional? What events or characters did you feel a bond or connection with that it made you feel as I did? And also kudos to GRRM for making me feel from a character who technically isn't even one of the main characters.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) I wept

Willas tyrel: we have never actually seen him and he seems to know a lot about the world. As far as information wise he doesn’t know too much of the story like olennw tyrel. Also I think that mace tyrell will be killed somehow leaving him in charge of the Euron situation. Also we were told that high garden will be shown more in TWOW and no characters seem to have future storylines there.

Blackfish: he might be the new leader of the BWB which I would like to see but there’s no solid evidence for this and it wouldn’t make sense with there also being Jaime and Brienne as pov characters in the river lands

Howland reed: he is probably the most important character who is not in the books yet but will be TWOW. He knows so much information that will involve Jon’s storyline.

501,"1. **This literally wouldn't be the first time George RR Martin would have written about an ice dragon in a fictional story - and one that coexists with and battles fire-breathing dragons too**. GRRM literally wrote a short story named [The Ice Dragon](https://georgerrmartin.com/grrm_book/the-ice-dragon/), where an ice dragon existed and faced off against normal fire-breathing dragons. The ice dragon, at the end of the story, melted and turned into a pool (not unlike the one near Winterfell). There are also rumors of dragon eggs in Winterfell or at The Wall, both places associated with the cold. 

&gt;*We can dismiss Mushroom's claim in his Testimony that the dragon* ***Vermax*** ***left a clutch of eggs somewhere in the depths of Winterfell's crypts, where the waters of the hot springs run close to the*** ***walls****, while his rider treated with Cregan Stark at the start of the Dance of the Dragons. As Archmaester Gyldayn notes in his fragmentary history, there is no record that* ***Vermax*** *ever laid so much as a single egg, suggesting the dragon was male.* ***The belief that dragons could change sex at need is erroneous, according to Maester Anson's Truth, rooted in a misunderstanding of the esoteric metaphor that Barth preferred when discussing the higher mysteries****.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Within its walls, the castle sprawls across several acres of land, encompassing many freestanding buildings. The oldest of these—a long-abandoned tower, round and squat and covered with gargoyles—has become known as the First Keep. Some take this to mean that it was built by the First Men, but Maester Kennet has definitively proved that it could not have existed before the arrival of the Andals since the First Men and the early Andals raised square towers and keeps. Round towers came sometime later. - TWOIAF*  
&gt;  
&gt; *There were* ***dragons*** *here two hundred years ago,* ***Sam*** *found himself thinking, as he watched the cage making a slow descent. They would just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen Alysanne had visited Castle Black on her* ***dragon****, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after her on his own.* ***Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had Stannis found one egg on Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over his eggs, and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery. All they got for it was farce and tragedy****. - Samwell, AFFC*

2. **There are reports of extreme cold strong enough to freeze entire ships, which would make sense if it was the breath of an ice dragon, or in other words, if ice dragons existed.**

&gt;*Of all the queer and fabulous denizens of the Shivering Sea, however, the greatest are the* ***ice*** ***dragons***\*. These colossal beasts, many times larger than the\* ***dragons*** *of Valyria, are said to be made of living* ***ice***\*, with eyes of pale blue crystal and vast translucent wings through which the moon and stars can be glimpsed as they wheel across the sky. Whereas common\* ***dragons*** *(if any* ***dragon*** *can truly be said to be common) breathe flame,* ***ice*** ***dragons*** *supposedly breathe cold, a chill so terrible that it can freeze a man solid in half a heartbeat.*  
***Sailors from half a hundred nations have glimpsed these great beasts over the centuries, so mayhaps there is some truth behind the tales***\*. Archmaester Margate has suggested that many legends of the north—freezing mists, ice ships, Cannibal Bay, and the like—can be explained as distorted reports of ice-dragon activity. Though an amusing notion, and not without a certain elegance, this remains the purest conjecture.\* ***As ice dragons supposedly melt when slain, no actual proof of their existence has ever been found***\*. - TWOIAF\*

You know what else melts when slain? **The Others - fellow mythical beings. Except they're real.**

&gt;*When he opened his eyes the Other's armor was running down its legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in its throat. It reached down with two bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked.*  
***Sam rolled onto his side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away***\*. In twenty heartbeats its flesh was gone, swirling away in a fine white mist. Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and they were\* ***melting*** *too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if it were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop it up and flung it down again at once. ""Mother, that's cold."" - Samwell, ASOS*

Why not ice dragons too?

3. **Jon was ''friends'' with a constellation known as** ***The Ice Dragon***.  

In fact, the term ''ice dragon'' appears in his POV **multiple times**:

&gt;*So many stars, he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and firs and ash. Maester Luwin had taught him his stars as a boy in Winterfell; he had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven and the rulers of each; he could find the seven wanderers sacred to the Faith; he was old friends with the* ***Ice*** ***Dragon***\*, *the Shadowcat, the Moonmaid, and the Sword of the Morning. All those he shared with Ygritte, but not some of the others. We look up at the same stars, and see such different things. The King's Crown was the Cradle, to hear her tell it; the Stallion was the Horned Lord; the red wanderer that septons preached was sacred to their Smith up here was called the Thief. And when the Thief was in the Moonmaid, that was a propitious time for a man to steal a woman, Ygritte insisted. ""Like the night you stole me. The Thief was bright that night."" - Jon, ASOS\**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
*Jon nodded weakly. The door Thunder rumbled softly in the distance, but above him the clouds were breaking up. Jon searched the sky until he found the* ***Ice*** ***Dragon****\*, then turned the mare north for the Wall and Castle Black. The throb of pain in his thigh muscle made him wince as he put his heels into the old man's horse. I am going home, he told himself. But if that was true, why did he feel so hollow? - Jon, ASOS\**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
*The door swung open. Pyp led them in, followed by Clydas and the lantern. It was all Jon could do to keep up with Maester Aemon. The* ***ice*** *pressed close around them, and he could feel the cold seeping into his bones, the weight of the Wall above his head. It felt like walking down the gullet of an* ***ice*** ***dragon***\*. The tunnel took a twist, and then another. Pyp unlocked a second iron gate. They walked farther, turned again, and saw light ahead, faint and pale through the\* ***ice***\*. That's bad, Jon knew at once. That's very bad. - Jon, ASOS\*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
*They rode the winch lift back to the ground. The wind was gusting, cold as the breath of the* ***ice*** ***dragon*** *in the tales Old Nan had told when Jon was a boy. The heavy cage was swaying. From time to time it scraped against the Wall, starting small crystalline showers of* ***ice*** *that sparkled in the sunlight as they fell, like shards of broken glass. - Jon, ADWD*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
*The road beneath the Wall was as dark and cold as the belly of an* ***ice*** ***dragon*** *and as twisty as a serpent. Dolorous Edd led them through with a torch in hand. Mully had the keys for the three gates, where bars of black iron as thick as a man's arm closed off the passage. Spearmen at each gate knuckled their foreheads at Jon Snow but stared openly at Val and her garron. - Jon, ADWD*  
*The snowfall was light today, a thin scattering of flakes dancing in the air, but the wind was blowing from the east along the Wall, cold as the breath of the* ***ice*** ***dragon*** *in the tales Old Nan used to tell.* ***Even Melisandre's fire was shivering***\*; the flames huddled down in the ditch, crackling softly as the red priestess sang. Only Ghost seemed not to feel the chill. - Jon, ADWD\*

4. **The Others** ***need*** **a counter for Daenerys's dragons when they meet in battle**. We know the Others are weak to fire, and it is *very likely* Daenerys's dragons will be involved in the fight against them. This should technically end in a curbstomp battle that sees the Others losing *badly*. This isn't the show where the Night King could somehow smirk in the face of dragon fire.

&gt;*""The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,"" said Sam, ""and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel.* ***Fire*** *will* ***dismay*** ***them***\*, though, and they are vulnerable to obsidian."" He remembered the one he had faced in the haunted forest, and how it had seemed to melt away when he stabbed it with the dragonglass dagger Jon had made for him. ""I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade of dragonsteel. Supposedly they could not stand against it."" - Samwell, AFFC\*

And that's regular fire. Dragon fire is *much stronger*, to the point that it can destroy mighty castles like Harrenhal and kill everyone inside with ease. Harren the Black had been counting on his castle to save him from Balerion the Black Dread - it's safe to say that didn't pan out very well for him.

&gt;*That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident.* ***But she was mounted on a dragon, not a horse. When she saw the Usurper's rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part*** ***exulted****. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*She woke suddenly in the darkness of her cabin, still flush with triumph. Balerion seemed to wake with her, and she heard the faint creak of wood, water lapping against the hull, a football on the deck above her head. And something else. - Daenerys, ASOS*

*More proof the Others really can't just beat dragons on their own*. We also know Rhaegar lost on the Trident, and therefore Daenerys defeating the Others singlehandedly is not gonna happen.

It is possible that dragons were used to defeat the Others in the first Long Night. It is curious fire and dragonsteel - *two substances associated with dragons* in a sense - were used to great effect against the Others. What's to say dragons weren't used either? It would sure explain a major mystery.

&gt;*The men of the Night’s Watch were as thunderstruck by the queen’s dragon as the people of White Harbor had been, though the queen herself noted that* ***Silverwing “does not like this Wall.”*** *Though it was* ***summer and the Wall was weeping***\*, the chill of the ice could still be felt whenever the wind blew, and every gust would make the dragon hiss and snap. “**Thrice I flew Silverwing high above Castle Black, and thrice I tried to take her north beyond the Wall,” Alysanne wrote to Jaehaerys, “but every time she veered back south again and refused to go. Never before has she refused to take me where I wished to go. I laughed about it when I came down again, so the black brothers would not realize anything was amiss, but it troubled me then and it troubles me still**.” - TWOIAF\*

I believe The Wall is built with special protective spells to ward dragons away from the far North where the Others live, presumably to protect the Others from their destructive power as part of a mutual ***non-aggression pact*** among humans, Others, and the children of the forest. We know the Last Hero helped broker an alliance between humans and the children - *why not the Others too*? The fact that the Others *weren't entirely exterminated* but *left behind a Wall* implies they made a deal.

The mutual non-aggression pact was basically this. The Wall goes up, restricting the Others - who lost the war - to what would be known as the Lands of Always Winter. This would ensure the Others would never be able to hurt humanity again. In return, humanity won't bring dragons - kryptonite to the Others - far north in an attempt to exterminate them. Think of it as a pact to not use nuclear weapons against each other, except this pact has actual enforcement behind it through The Wall's magic.

Of course, if the Others *do* attack humanity and The Wall falls, they're gonna get crushed by fire dragons and dragonsteel *again*. That is, unless they have an *ice dragon* on their side. They need something to make the difference. It should be noted that while ice is weak to fire, fire also doesn't much like ice either. Therefore, an ice dragon - or two, or three - would MASSIVELY tilt the favor of the battle back in the Others' favor. Keep in mind these are bigger and stronger than ''Valyrian'' dragons.

&gt;*I lowered the poor child into a tub and covered her with ice. The shock of that immersion stopped her heart at once, I tell myself…if so, that was a mercy, for that was when the* ***things inside her came out***\*…The things…Mother have mercy, I do not know how to speak of them…they were…**worms with faces**…**snakes with hands**…twisting, slimy, unspeakable things that seemed to writhe and pulse and squirm\* ***as they came bursting from her flesh***\*. Some were no bigger than my little finger, but one at least was as long as my arm…oh, Warrior protect me, the sounds they made…\*  
*They died, though. I must remember that, cling to that. Whatever they might have been,* ***they were creatures of heat and fire, and they did not love the ice, oh no***\*. One after another they thrashed and writhed and died before my eyes, thank the Seven. I will not presume to give them names…they were horrors.”\* - TWOIAF

Fire may be effective against ice, but ice can also beat fire under the right conditions. As seen with the wyrms inside Aerea, beings of fire can be killed if exposed to sufficient cold. An ice dragon much bigger than the Valyrian dragons could go a long way in neutering their presence and forcing the humans to use actual other strategy to defeat the Others instead of just spamming dragon fire. It would, suffice to say, make for a *much more difficult and climactic battle* \- fitting for ASOIAF.

**TLDR:** Ice dragons exist, and there are strong clues that they may be used by the Others in their war against humanity. They appeared in a separate story written by GRRM, have been mentioned both in the main books as mythical beings by *Old Nan* of all people (the same one who told us about the White Walkers) and in many other cases, and are mentioned in the world book too. Their existence is necessary to ensure the Others have a way of combating Daenerys's dragons.",asoiaf,[Spoiler Extended] Why an ice dragon must appear in A Song of Ice and Fire
502,"This may be controversial or removed if so sorry. The story I recommend for the people of this sub is a Japanese lightnovel/webnovel/manga/anime by the name of re:zero. In its basic premise Subaru is a guy moved to a fantastical world all of a sudden where he meets a silver haired half elf. She's a hopeless do gooder and he believes her life would be wasted if he can't reign in her selfless kindness. In the first arc she has stolen the insignia that grants her the title of candidate for the throne. Through various situation our hero and this heroine find the place and try to get this back but Subaru is killed as soon as he walks into the place the girl a bit after. All of sudden Subaru is back to his first point where he started in the world. His power is death or precisely to return by death retaining his memories. 

Unlike other stories like edge of tomorrow Subaru has the fear of death you should have and maintains that throughout the story. He's decidedly average human without superhuman ability only his wits are about him. He faces a lot of usual events for a teenager as well as a couple of horrendous ones. 

The reason I thought this sub would like it is the world and character building is top notch. Each character has individual goals and schemes at play that we cannot see as Subarus limited pov. We can only see what he sees so a betrayal or something from his blindspots we cannot. We see him mentally break down, destroyed, built up destroyed again, PTSD to the extreme, these moments would render most people insane. Yet he tries flailing like a madman he keeps going.

Now the main draw is the writing the other is descriptive at certain points making even the reader feel abused by the events of the novel. His story layering is incredibly deep, throughout 12 translated light novels theirs still mounds of exposition left and theirs 22 light novels as of now.

These novels are close to 200 pgs each so 2400 translated pages are available to date. 

My write up does not do the story justice as it more deep and crazier than many I have read.

We know that tourney was organized by lord Whent by initiative of his cousin, member of the Kingsguard, Oswell Whent. I don't think that Ser Oswell acted behind the back of his King, so what was the point? 

I think that Rhaegar with approval of his dad made plan of how don't allow the union of the lords to happen.

506,"I'm sure this has been discussed before (by now, what hasn't?) - but I'm interested in hearing opinions about what consequences 1) Quentyn's death, and 2) Cletus Yronwood's death will have, if any.

I think Dany will get blamed for Quentyn's death.  We've already seen how rumors and exaggeration have affected her reputation.  Her dragons singe Grazdan's tokar, and that later becomes her dragons 'setting an envoy on fire.' 

I could easily see the Dornish blame Dany for Quentyn's death.  Either because they actually believe it, or because it's useful propaganda if she ends up in opposition to Arianne / (f)Aegon.  

WRT Cletus Yronwood:  The Yronwoods are one of the most powerful houses in Dorne.  Recall that the Yronwoods are First Men, and were 'High Kings' of Dorne prior to Nymeria's conquest.  They were also Blackfyre supporters, while House Martell fought for the Targaryens.  More recently, when Oberyn was 16, he killed Lord Edgar Yronwood in a duel.  So there's a bit of a rivalry / history.

Quentyn was fostered with the Yronwoods from about 274 (\~ 10 years prior to Robert's Rebellion), in compensation for Lord Edgar's death. Quentyn was also knighted by Anders.  Given that Anders sends both Cletus (his only son and heir) and Archibald (his nephew) with Quentyn, it's fair to assume that at that point, the Yronwoods and the Martells are on good terms.  The death of both Cletus and Quentyn will weaken that relationship. 

At this point in the story, most of the Dornish vassal houses want to go to war. I could see the death of Cletus and Quentyn being a catalyst for either 1) Anders Yronwood, and potentially other houses, going to war without Doran's permission, or 2) a rebellion against the Martells in Dorne.  

Oberyn was born in either 257 or 258.  He killed Edgar Yronwood when he was 16, so around 274. Quentyn wasn't born until 281, and he didn't go to foster with the Yronwoods until he was 8 or so (\~289).  It feels kind of weird that there was an outstanding blood feud for over a decade that was resolved so much later.  

Presumably, given that Arianne Martell was bethrothed to Viserys in the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion, the plan was for Quentyn to become heir to Dorne at the time he went to Yronwood.  There must have been a match for him with one of the Yronwood daughters.  It's a bit strange that no betrothal / marriage between Quentyn and one of Anders daughters had happened before Viserys died. 

Separately, it's interesting to think about who the Yronwood heir is now - potentially one of Anders' daughters, Ynys or Gwenyth.  Ynys Yronwood married the Allyrion heir, potentially setting up a new power block.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) - Dorne Consequences
507,"Provided Jon is crowned King in the North in accordance to Robb's will, do you think LSH would give him Robb's crown, which is her possession at the moment, and/or support hid reign? I believe there are arguments for both sides.

On one hand, Catelyn totally hated Jon since Ned brought him to Winterfell and her main concern was inheritance. She didn't want Jon to usurp her trueborn children. If you add up that she is now a vengeful murdering zombie, it is hard to believe that she would forget her past grudges.

On the other, I could totally see her doing it out of guilt. I think she still has some more complex feelings that people give her credit for, as shown in this quote, where she is nearly crying over the crown:

&gt;A trestle table had been set up across the cave, in a cleft in the rock. Behind it sat a woman all in grey, cloaked and hooded. In her hands was a crown, a bronze circlet ringed by iron swords. She was studying it, her fingers stroking the blades as if to test their sharpness. Her eyes glimmered under her hood.

I believe that maybe the guilt over Robb's death will lead her to honor her son's last wish, even if it means leaving behind her hatred of Jon.

What do you think? Would love to read some opinions about this. I think the second option would be more rich story-wise, giving LSH some kind of redemption, but is logistically more complicated.",asoiaf,[SPOILERS EXTENDED] On a certain bronze crown and Lady Stoneheart

&gt; Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints—the ground's too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does he get more worms than I do ...

&gt; ""Something worse than we can imagine,"" suggested Dolorous Edd. ""Well, I might be able to imagine it, but I'd sooner not. Bad enough to know you're going to come to some awful end without thinking about it aforetime.""

&gt; ""There's always a bear,"" declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation. ""One killed my brother when I was young. Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong. And they were good teeth too, better than mine. I've had nothing but trouble with my teeth.""

&gt; He found Dolorous Edd at the fire, complaining about how difficult it was for him to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods. Jon gave him something new to complain about.

Though I would sooner it were wine than water. There are worse ways to die than warm and drunk. I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once. It was a poor vintage, though, and his corpse did not improve it.""  
&gt; ""You drank the wine?""  
&gt; ""It's an awful thing to find a brother dead. You'd have need of a drink as well, Lord Snow."" Edd stirred the kettle and added a pinch more nutmeg.

&gt; ""We'll never find that one, and I'll be blamed,"" announced Edd Tollett, the dour grey-haired squire everyone called Dolorous Edd. ""Nothing ever goes missing that they don't look at me, ever since that time I lost my horse. As if that could be helped. He was white and it was snowing, what did they expect?""

&gt; ""Fall is falling fast enough, there's no need to help it."" He sighed. ""And we all know what follows fall. Gods, but I am cold.""

&gt; Jon knew the tale as well. Arson Iceaxe had been halfway through the Wall when his tunnel was found by rangers from the Nightfort. They did not trouble to disturb him at his digging, only sealed the way behind with ice and stone and snow. Dolorous Edd used to say that if you pressed your ear flat to the Wall, you could still hear Arson chipping away with his axe.

ASOS Samwell II

&gt; The ground beneath his feet was a slush of melting snow and soft mud that Dolorous Edd insisted was made of Craster's shit. It was thicker than shit, though; it sucked at Sam's boots so hard he felt one pull loose.

&gt; ""Never knew Bannen could smell so good."" Edd's tone was as morose as ever. ""I had half a mind to carve a slice off him. If we had some applesauce, I might have done it. Pork's always best with applesauce, I find."" Edd undid his laces and pulled out his cock. ""You best not die, Sam, or I fear I might succumb. There's bound to be more crackling on you than Bannen ever had, and I never could resist a bit of crackling."" He sighed as his piss arced out, yellow and steaming. ""We ride at first light, did you hear? Sun or snow, the Old Bear tells me.""  
&gt; Sun or snow. Sam glanced up anxiously at the sky. ""Snow?"" he squeaked. ""We . . . ride? All of us?""  
&gt; ""Well, no, some will need to walk."" He shook himself. ""Dywen now, he says we need to learn to ride dead horses, like the Others do. He claims it would save on feed. How much could a dead horse eat?"" Edd laced himself back up. ""Can't say I fancy the notion. Once they figure a way to work a dead horse, we'll be next. Likely I'll be the first too. 'Edd,' they'll say, 'dying's no excuse for lying down no more, so get on up and take this spear, you've got the watch tonight.' Well, I shouldn't be so gloomy. Might be I'll die before they work it out.""

And commanding them would be red-faced Bowen Marsh, the plump Lord Steward who had been made castellan in Lord Mormont's absence. Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh ""the Old Pomegranate,"" which fit him just as well as ""the Old Bear"" fit Mormont. ""He's the man you want in front when the foes are in the field,"" Edd would say in his usual dour voice. ""He'll count them right up for you. A regular demon for counting, that one.""

ASOS Samwell IV

&gt; ""I never win anything,"" Dolorous Edd complained. ""The gods always smiled on Watt, though. When the wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls, somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water. How lucky was that, missing all those rocks?""  
&gt; ""Was it a long fall?"" Grenn wanted to know. ""Did landing in the pool of water save his life?""  
&gt; ""No,"" said Dolorous Edd. ""He was dead already, from that axe in his head. Still, it was pretty lucky, missing the rocks.""

&gt; Dolorous Edd got up, stone-faced and glum as ever. ""I just want to say to whoever is voting for me that I would certainly make an awful Lord Commander. But so would all these others.""

Not only the duality of ice/fire but also characters who exhibit both (Jon Snow, among others) and the ""sources of magic"" that they are, as well as the religions and fantastic cryptids that come from each.

**In this post, I just wanted to discuss some of the mentions of ""ice and fire"" throughout the series**

***

#Examples

**Sticks on Drogo's funeral pyre**

The first true mention occurs in AGOT wrt Drogo's funeral pyre:

&gt;The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger, and covered with dry leaves and twigs. **They laid them north to south, from ice to fire**, and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks. The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done. Dany called the Dothraki around her. Fewer than a hundred were left. How many had Aegon started with? she wondered. It did not matter. -AGOT, Daenerys X

***

**Meera/Jojen oath**

&gt;""I swear it by earth and water,"" said the boy in green.

&gt;""I swear it by bronze and iron,"" his sister said.

&gt;""We swear it by ice and fire,"" they finished together. -ACOK, Bran III

and:

&gt;Meera took Bran by the hand. ""If we stay here, troubling no one, you'll be safe until the war ends. You will not learn, though, except what my brother can teach you, and you've heard what he says. If we leave this place to seek refuge at Last Hearth or beyond the Wall, we risk being taken. You are only a boy, I know, but you are our prince as well, our lord's son and our king's true heir. **We have sworn you our faith by earth and water, bronze and iron, ice and fire**. The risk is yours, Bran, as is the gift. The choice should be yours too, I think. We are your servants to command."" She grinned. ""At least in this."" -ASOS, Bran I

**Cat with a possible meta comment about ice/fire**

&gt;""Send my daughters back unharmed?"" Catelyn smiled sadly. ""There is a sweet innocence about you, child. I could wish . . . but no. Robb will avenge his brothers. **Ice can kill as dead as fire. Ice was Ned's greatsword. Valyrian steel, marked with the ripples of a thousand foldings, so sharp I feared to touch it.** Robb's blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice. It will not be easy for him to get Theon's head off, I fear. The Starks do not use headsmen. Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade, though he never took any joy in the duty. But I would, oh, yes."" She stared at her scarred hands, opened and closed them, then slowly raised her eyes. ""I've sent him wine."" -ACOK, Catelyn VII

***

**The Wall**

There are numerous examples of sunlight, fire, shadows on the Wall:

&gt;**The heat of the fires was making the Wall weep, and the flames danced and shimmered against the ice.** The steps shook to the footsteps of men running for their lives. -ASOS, Jon VII

and:

&gt;The huge carcass of a dead mammoth partially blocked the way. One of the beast's tusks snagged his cloak and tore it as he edged past. Three more giants lay outside, half buried beneath stone and slush and hardened pitch. **He could see where the fire had melted the Wall, where great sheets of ice had come sloughing off in the heat to shatter on the blackened ground**. He looked up at where they'd come from. When you stand here it seems immense, as if it were about to crush you. -ASOS, Jon VIII

and:

&gt;A wind swirled against the Wall, tugging at his cloak. He could feel the cold coming off the ice the way heat comes off a fire. Jon pulled up his hood and began to walk again.  -ASOS, Jon XII

and:

&gt;Jon Snow turned away. **The last light of the sun had begun to fade. He watched the cracks along the Wall go from red to grey to black, from streaks of fire to rivers of black ice. Down below, Lady Melisandre would be lighting her nightfire and chanting, Lord of Light, defend us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.** -ADWD, Jon XI

There are numerous other references to the wall/fire and people using fire around ice, etc. I cut most of them for spacing, but feel free to address any particular instance you enjoy.

**Rhaegar speaking to Elia**

Rhaegar says this to Elia (confirmed by GRRM) while looking at Dany:

&gt;""He has a song,"" the man replied. **""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""** He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. ""The dragon has three heads."" He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way. -ACOK, Daenerys IV

and:

&gt;Dany could not let it go. **""His is the song of ice and fire, my brother said. I'm certain it was my brother. Not Viserys, Rhaegar.** He had a harp with silver strings. 

&gt;""Prince Aegon was Rhaegar's heir by Elia of Dorne,"" Ser Jorah said. ""But if he was this prince that was promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall.""

&gt;""I remember,"" Dany said sadly. ""They murdered Rhaegar's daughter as well, the little princess. Rhaenys, she was named, like Aegon's sister. There was no Visenya, but he said the dragon has three heads. What is the song of ice and fire?""

&gt;""It's no song I've ever heard.""-ACOK, Daenerys V

***

**The Others**

&gt;The Other's sword gleamed with a faint blue glow. It moved toward Grenn, lightning quick, slashing. When the ice blue blade brushed the flames, a screech stabbed Sam's ears sharp as a needle. The head of the torch tumbled sideways to vanish beneath a deep drift of snow, the fire snuffed out at once. -ASOS, Samwell I

***

**More Meta**

&gt;""Why can't it be both?"" Meera reached up to pinch his nose.

&gt;**""Because they're different,"" he insisted. ""Like night and day, or ice and fire.""**

&gt;**""If ice can burn,"" said Jojen in his solemn voice, ""then love and hate can mate. Mountain or marsh, it makes no matter. The land is one.""** -ASOS, Bran II

***

**Melisandre and duality**

&gt;""The way the world is made. The truth is all around you, plain to behold. **The night is dark and full of terrors, the day bright and beautiful and full of hope. One is black, the other white. There is ice and there is fire. Hate and love. Bitter and sweet. Male and female. Pain and pleasure. Winter and summer. Evil and good."" She took a step toward him. ""Death and life. Everywhere, opposites. Everywhere, the war.""** -ASOS, Davos III

and:

&gt;With a smile and swirl of scarlet skirts, she was gone. Only her scent lingered after. That, and the torch. Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped his arms about his knees. The shifting torchlight washed over him. Once Melisandre's footsteps faded away, the only sound was the scrabbling of rats. I**ce and fire, he thought. Black and white. Dark and light. Davos could not deny the power of her god. He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre's womb, and the priestess knew things she had no way of knowing. She saw my purpose in her flames. It was good to learn that Salla had not sold him, but the thought of the red woman spying out his secrets with her fires disquieted him more than he could say. And what did she mean when she said that I had served her god and would serve him again?** He did not like that either. -ASOS, Davos III

**Stannis/Lightbringer**

This could probably go under the Wall or Mel/Davos section, but the false Lightbringer made it stand out to me:

&gt;The sword glowed red and yellow and orange, alive with light. Jon had seen the show before … but not like this, never before like this. Lightbringer was the sun made steel. When Stannis raised the blade above his head, men had to turn their heads or cover their eyes. Horses shied, and one threw his rider. **The blaze in the fire pit seemed to shrink before this storm of light, like a small dog cowering before a larger one.

Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. ""I am the Lord of Winterfell,"" Jon screamed.

**Super Meta**

&gt;It may not always be so. As this history has shown, the world has seen many ages. Many thousands of years have passed from the Dawn Age to today. Castles have risen and fallen, as have kingdoms. Crofters have been born, grown to work the fields, and died of age or mishap or illness, leaving behind children to do the same. Princes have been born, grown to wear a crown, and died in war or bed or tourney, leaving behind reigns great, forgettable, or reviled. **The world has known ice in the Long Night, and it has known fire in the Doom.** From the Frozen Shore to Asshai-by-the-Shadow, this world of ice and fire has revealed a rich and glorious history—although there is much yet to be discovered. If more fragments of Maester Gyldayn's manuscript are located—or if other such incomparable treasures (at least to the maesters' eyes) are uncovered—more of our ignorance may be sponged away. But one thing can be said with certainty. As the next thousand years unfold—and the thousands beyond that—many more will be born, and live, and die. And history will continue to unfold, as strange and complex and compelling as what my humble pen was able to lay before you here. -TWOIAF, The Glorious Reign

So hopefully **the seed is there, the foreshadowing is there, but maybe you won't notice it, because it's surrounded by so many other things**.""

&gt; -[The George R. R. Martin Podcast, Episode 7 \(9:17\)](https://youtu.be/6S9wK714S3Q?t=9m17s)

George is very clever: In ADWD he introduced the character of Young Griff, seemingly the unimportant son of a sellsword, but he left hints that the boy was more than he appeared — his dyed blue hair, his father ""Griff,"" the fact that he was being trained by a knight, a septa, and a halfmaester, etc. These details made sense once we finally got the big reveal: Young Griff is actually Rhaegar's son Aegon Targaryen! What a twist!

Some readers bought this, but more suspicious readers began to doubt this story as well, and picked up on subtler clues and symbolism suggesting that Aegon is actually a Blackfyre descendant, and/or the son of Illyrio and Serra ... and/or a descendant of Aerion Brightflame. Other readers concluded that Aegon is just a random boy from Essos with Valyrian features, or that his true identity doesn't matter at all, and will never be revealed. And George? George is laughing his ass off.

Because he's been leading us down the garden path big time, planting trails upon trails of false breadcrumbs for us to follow, making us think we've found the truth, when the reality is that we couldn't be further from it. If we want to unravel the mystery of Aegon, we're going to need to look past George's layers of distractions, misdirections, and red herrings, so we can see the true seed that has been planted here. We're going to need to think outside the box that George has trapped us in.

And we can start by taking a close look at this key passage:

&gt; The bacon turned crisp, the biscuits golden brown. Young Griff stumbled up onto deck yawning. ""Good morrow, all."" The lad was shorter than Duck, but his lanky build suggested that he had not yet come into his full growth. **This beardless boy could have any maiden** in the Seven Kingdoms, blue hair or no. Those eyes of his would melt them. **Like his sire, Young Griff had blue eyes**, but where the father's eyes were pale, the son's were dark. By lamplight they turned black, and in the light of dusk they seemed purple. (Tyrion IV, ADWD)

George tries to confuse us regarding the color of Aegon's eyes: in this light they look black, in this light they look purple, they look blue because of his blue hair, they're lighter than Rhaegar's ""deep purple"" eyes, blah blah. It's all misdirection. George told us the truth up front, but we just didn't want to see it: Aegon has blue eyes. ""Like his sire."" This is one of those classic GRRM double meanings.

Because you know who else was a blue-eyed, beardless, maiden magnet in their youth?

&gt; Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a throne, **the Lord of Storm's End had been clean-shaven**, clear-eyed, and muscled **like a maiden's fantasy**.  (Eddard I, AGOT)

#

&gt; He found himself thinking of Robert more and more. He saw the king as he had been in the flower of his youth, tall and handsome, his great antlered helm on his head, his warhammer in hand, sitting his horse like a horned god. He heard his laughter in the dark, saw **his eyes, blue and clear as mountain lakes**. (Eddard XV, AGOT)

That's right: Aegon's true father isn't Rhaegar, or Illyrio, or a random Lyseni — it's Robert Motherfucking Baratheon.

Remember that statue Tyrion saw in Illyrio's manse? Illyrio said it depicts him as a young man, but that's an obvious lie; the statue is a near-perfect match to Aegon, and one detail is particularly interesting:

&gt; A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo's blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though **his sword shimmered like true steel**. (Tyrion I, ADWD)

And how does Donal Noye's famous quote start again...

&gt; The armorer considered that a moment. ""**Robert was the true steel**."" (Jon I, ACOK)

Just think of all the irony, parallels, and connections that result from Aegon being one of Robert's bastards:

* Robert's son is gaining power and influence in the world, but he's being passed off as the ""dragonspawn"" of Rhaegar, who Robert killed at the Trident.

* Jon Connington, who thinks he's raising the son of Rhaegar, is actually raising the son of Robert, the man he tried and failed to kill at Stoney Sept, which has haunted him ever since.

* Robert was fostered by *Jon* Arryn, who was like a ""second father"" to him, and Aegon was raised by *Jon* Connington, who pretended to be his actual father.

* When Daenerys inevitably confronts Aegon, she will unknowingly be facing one of ""the Usurper's"" children, adding a hidden extra dimension to their conflict.

* Aegon's first major victory in Westeros is taking Storm's End, the ancestral seat of House Baratheon (from Stannis' men no less — Robert screwing over Stannis once more from beyond the grave).

* Aegon will presumably go on to take the throne from Cersei and her bastards Tommen and Myrcella — Cersei facilitated Robert's death, had some of his bastards killed, and passed off her own children as Robert's, so her losing power because of Aegon would be a weird kind of poetic justice.

* Rhaegar's son is raised as Ned's bastard, while Robert's bastard is raised as Rhaegar's son.

* Robert wanted to head to Essos and become a ""sellsword king."" Aegon pretended to be the son of a sellsword in Essos, and is now coming to be king at the head of a sellsword army.

* Robert is described as ""impatient,"" ""rash,"" and ""headstrong,"" which matches Aegon's personality as well (e.g. kicking over the cyvasse board, deciding to head to Westeros without Daenerys, insisting on leading the attack on Storm's End).

* Aegon's ""lanky build"" suggests that he would be tall when fully grown, just like Robert.

* During the Dance of the Dragons, Borros Baratheon left instructions for his wife to name their child Aegon if it was a boy, after Aegon II. She didn't end up following his wishes, naming the child [Olyver](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Olyver_Baratheon) instead, but if she had, the boy would have been named ""Aegon Baratheon."" George was teasing the idea of a Baratheon descendant named Aegon to set up this twist with Young Griff. (And in the second Dance that George has promised us, Aegon will play the role of Aegon II to Dany's Rhaenyra.)

* Robert once told Ned ""I have a son. You have a daughter."" and offered to join their houses through Joffrey and Sansa. Since Joffrey is not actually Robert's son, some readers wondered if this was sneakily foreshadowing a relationship between Robert's son Gendry and Ned's daughter Arya. But this could also be foreshadowing a relationship between Robert's son *Aegon* and one of Ned's daughters, likely Sansa. Of course, Aegon will probably remain known to the public as Rhaegar's son, but in a way this makes the connection even better: Aegon wanting to marry Sansa for politics/love would parallel both Robert *and* Rhaegar's interest in Lyanna.

* Et cetera

There were always more of Robert's bastards out there: Maggy the Frog predicted that Robert would have 16 children, and Varys knows about 8 of them:

&gt; ""Robert's bastards? What of them?""

&gt; ""**He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing**,"" Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle. (Tyrion III, ACOK)

Not coincidentally, we know about *7* of Robert's bastards:

1) Gendry

2) Edric Storm

3) Mya Stone

4) Bella

5) Barra

6 &amp; 7) Twins at Casterly Rock

Who is the 8th bastard that Varys knows about? Why, the one he's been raising in secret, of course.

This is what must have happened:

Shortly after Robert was crowned king following the rebellion, he was still furious at the Targaryens. However, most of them were already dead, Viserys and Daenerys had escaped from Dragonstone, and Jon Arryn was dissuading Robert from sending assassins after them. He needed another way to take out his frustrations. So Robert made a decision: if he could no longer fuck over the Targaryens, he would instead fuck someone who looked like a Targaryen. 

He made this desire known to his small council, so Varys reached out to his birthplace of Lys, where the blood of Valyria still runs strong, and procured a prostitute with silver hair and purple eyes. Robert fucked her, getting most of the anger out of his system, then sent her back to Lys, forgetting all about it. But the Spider kept an eye on her, and nine moons later, when she gave birth to a boy with her silver hair and Robert's blue eyes, which could pass for purple, he hatched a devious plan...

Varys stole or bought the babe from the prostitute, then brought him to Illyrio. Maybe Varys told Illyrio the boy is Robert Baratheon's bastard, or maybe he lied that the boy is Aegon Targaryen, and that he smuggled him out of King's Landing before the Sack. Either way, Illyrio got to raise Aegon in his manse for a time, and became fond of the boy, who reminded him of his late wife Serra (who had silver hair and blue eyes). 

A few years later, they contacted Jon Connington and captain-general Myles ""Blackheart"" Toyne of the Golden Company. They told Connington that the boy was Rhaegar's son, which he was desperate to believe, despite any doubts, so he could have a chance at redemption. And, if necessary, they convinced Blackheart Toyne that the boy was a Blackfyre descendant instead, so he would sign the ""contract writ in blood"" pledging the Golden Company to put Aegon on the Iron Throne when the time came. And then Varys could have his perfect little puppet king, and Illyrio could dote on Aegon like the son he never had. Voila!

That's their plan, anyway. The Mother of Dragons is likely to get in the way of it.

(Slightly alternate version: Just like with [Bella](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bella), Robert could have conceived Aegon on a prostitute at the Peach in Stoney Sept, which is where he was hiding during Robert's Rebellion while Jon Connington (who would later raise Aegon) searched the town for him. What a weird twist of fate that would be!)

___

As to how Aegon's true identity could be revealed to the reader, there could be a scene from Jon Connington's POV where Varys kills him after he's served his purpose, similar to how Varys killed Kevan, except this time there wouldn't be any little birds around, so Varys would be able to tell Jon the truth before he dies, as one final twist of the knife: Jon Connington spent years raising, protecting, and fighting for — not Rhaegar's son — but Robert's bastard.

Of course there is also Bran, who could use his abilities as a greenseer to discover the truth about Aegon, among many other things — ""in time you will see well beyond the trees themselves.""

The larger Westerosi population will probably never learn that Aegon is Robert's bastard, but that plays right into the idea that ""power resides where men believe it resides."" Varys took a bastard of Robert's and propped him up as the trueborn son of Rhaegar, and the realm had no clue.

Now, if you've been reading this post and thinking, ""Hold on, Aegon can't be Robert's son, because he doesn't have black hair!"" then I'm afraid you've fallen right into George's trap. Just because the Baratheons have a strong tendency towards black hair doesn't mean it's impossible for them to have other hair colors. In fact, don't you think that stressing the ""Baratheons have black hair"" connection is exactly what George would do if he wanted to pull the rug out from under you by revealing that a character with silver hair is actually a secret Baratheon?

Besides, George originally described [Rhaenys Targaryen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenys_Targaryen_\(daughter_of_Aemon\)), daughter of Jocelyn *Baratheon* and Aemon Targaryen, as having silver hair. He only recently retconned that in Fire &amp; Blood, no doubt to try and make this twist with Aegon harder to spot, but the point is that if George wants a Baratheon descendant to have silver hair, they're going to have silver hair. Remember that the Baratheons have Targaryen blood too: Orys Baratheon was almost certainly the half-brother of Aegon I, and Robert's grandmother was Rhaelle Targaryen, daughter of Aegon V. And at the end of the day, the ""genetics"" of Westeros serve the story, not the other way around.

A couple more supporting quotes:

&gt; In their midst, watching and laughing with his young queen by his side, sat **a ghost** in a golden crown.

&gt; **Small wonder the lords gather around him with such fervor**, she thought, **he is Robert come again**. Renly was **handsome as Robert had been handsome**; long of limb and broad of shoulder, with the same coal-black hair, fine and straight, **the same deep blue eyes**, the same easy smile. (Catelyn II, ACOK)

This passage comparing Renly to Robert was actually foreshadowing for Aegon all along.

&gt; ""Did you know **my true father**?""

&gt; ""Well, I saw him twice or thrice, but I was only ten when **Robert** killed him, and mine own sire had me hidden underneath a rock. No, I cannot claim I knew Prince Rhaegar. Not as your false father did. Lord Connington was the prince's dearest friend, was he not?"" (Tyrion VI, ADWD)

Sneaky George, slipping in a reference to Robert when Aegon asks about his real father.

If all of the above somehow hasn't convinced you, I've saved the smoking gun for last — a similarity between Robert and Aegon that is so striking, so compelling, it can only be explained by them being related — a passage in Book 1, echoed in Book 5, foreshadowing the reveal in Book 6/7 — a subtle seed that George planted with the utmost care:

&gt; Robert slapped Ned on the back. ""Ah, say that I'm a better king than Aerys and be done with it. You never could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark. I'm still young, and now that you're here with me, things will be different. We'll make this a reign to sing of, and damn the Lannisters to seven hells. **I smell bacon**."" (Eddard VII, AGOT)

#

&gt; Like his sire, Young Griff had blue eyes, but where the father's eyes were pale, the son's were dark. By lamplight they turned black, and in the light of dusk they seemed purple. His eyelashes were as long as any woman's. 

&gt; ""**I smell bacon**,"" the lad said, pulling on his boots. (Tyrion IV, ADWD)

533,"The one that stood out for me is:

&gt; Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. ""There are worse things than spiders and rats,"" he whispered. ""This is where the dead walk."" That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya's hand.

&gt; When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale and white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrinking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb's leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. ""You stupid,"" she told him, ""you scared the baby,"" but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too. AGoT-Arya IV

Not only is it funny, but it's the Stark kids innocently *playing* and *together*. (Since Bran was the baby, probably Rickon hadn't been born.) And their behaviors--minus the playfulness--show hints of their future characters. It may be foreshadowing for Jon and Ghost and the fact that JOn will rise from the dead. Maybe the Crypt is where the Dead really will walk. And finally, this memory calmed Arya's fear and gave her the courage to plunge even deeper into the tunnels to escape.

At this moment, a brave, loyal, pro-Stannis Night's Watch ranger who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war against the Others and fully supported all military decision made by his grace stood up and held up a sword.

“What are the Baratheon features?” The arrogant maester smirked quite Freyishly and smugly replied ""Black hair, blue eyes and square jawlines, you stupid red cultist.""

""Yes. If Joffrey was the trueborn son of King Robert, as you say… then he would've had black hair and blue eyes. Stannis is the true king! A monster sits the Iron Throne, an abomination born of incest!""

544,"In a podcast yesterday: George RR Martin stated, ""Hot Pie is Azor Ahai""

Even more, if we go to the thirty second Mellisandre chapter in A Game Of Thrones, we can see her state,""The Prince Who Was Promised has arrived and his name is Hot Pie"".

Considering Hot Pie wasn't even a character at this point in the novel, no wonder no one discovered this foreshadowing.

In the first Stannis chapter Fire and Blood, we can hear Stannis state, ""That fucking Hot Pie, what a fucking cool dude, he definitely is Azor Ahai"" 

So I know a lot of people didn't read Fire and Blood, so no wonder everyone didn't realize this one.

However, this next one was quite blatantly obvious.

In the third Gob Bluth chapter in A Dream of Spring (far after hot pie's character is introduced), it can be shown that, Azor Ahai himself, states, ""I love me some pie. Chicken Pot Pie, Pumpkin Pie, Cherry Pie, etc. And I love it served hot.""

So I know a lot of people imagined that this meant that he was going to set torch to Lys because he does state that he likes things served hot, I believe we are clearly overlooking something here. He is clearly stating, that he likes hot pies. Therefore, he is hot pie.

OK. For the Targaryen Part there is a lot less evidence, sadly. 

In the third Danearys Chapter of Winds and Wolves, Hot Pie is fucking Danearys. Hot Pie then states,   
""Don't you think it is kind of weird that I am fucking you?""

Then Danearys responds, ""No. Targaryens have always fucked relatives"".

So I know this doesn't necessarily mean that he is a targaryen, but considering we have already learned that Young Griff is actually Tyrion, maybe we could consider that Hot Pie is actually Aegon Targaryen.

This ties in to him being the Prince that was promised. 

When Danaerys visits the House of Undying she sees rhaegar claim that his son, Aegon, is the prince that was promised.

Furthermore, we learn from the first chapter in A World Of Ice and Ice, that a certain dragon looks like, a pie?

547,"Ranking the best Targaryen kings. (Spoilers None)

1) Jaehaerys I

This guy was just a master. After the horrible reigns of Maegor and Aenys he had to be good or risk the collapse of the monarchy. He defeated an invasion from Dorne, cared more for efficiency than noble blood in his government, and ensured a smooth transfer of power after his death due to him calling a great council. He also ended the devastating war with the faith.  

2) Aegon I

Aegon is mostly so high here for him conquering six kingdoms with just a few thousand men and 3 dragons. He also was a decent king. His royal progresses made people like the monarchy rather than fear it and he treaded carefully with the faith as well as built Kings Landing. What is keeping him off the top spot is his disastrous war in Dorne. 

3) Daeron II

Daeron came to power after his fathers horribly corrupt reign that left the treasury bankrupt. He quickly cleared away corruption and got the treasury paid off before peacefully getting Dorne to join the realms. He also defeated the first Blackfyre rebellion by realizing that he was not a warrior and sending warriors to fight it. 

4)Viserys II

Viserys only ruled in name for a year but in reality ruled in the name of his three predecessors. In these years he kept the realm together against their worst impulses. 

5) Viserys I 

Viserys's reign came on the heels of the glorious reign of Jaehaerys. Over the course of his reign the realm continued accumulating wealth while the Targaryens got more and more members and dragons. He tried to ensure a smooth succession to his daughter by forcing the lords to promise to defend her. Unfortunately, this failed and much of his and his grandfathers work was undone. This stops him being up any further. 

6) Maekar I

Maekar was never expected to become King. He had 3 older brothers, 2 of them having 2 children. Due to this he was not groomed to rule like his brother Baelor or his nephew Vallar but in my opinion he is the most underrated king. Before ascending he was pivotal in defeating the first and second Blackfyre rebellions. After becoming King he swore to be more warlike than his predecessors but he did not look to make war. The Blackfyres did not try to invade under his reign, perhaps knowing they could not win, and he decisively defeated both the Peakes and the Lothstons, although dying in the former. 

7) Jaehaerys II

Jaehaerys II only rules for three years but he saw the threat in the Ninepenny kings which his father did not.

8) Aegon III

Aegon did, quite literally, nothing. After getting power after reaching manhood he didn't do much, instead letting his hands rule his kingdom. Viserys did well in this job so the kingdom did alright during his short name. He is just here because the others were so bad.  Biggest blight is that he possibly killed the last dragon, which if true would knock him down a bunch of spots, but this was never proven.

9) Baelor I 

Baelor made peace with Dorne by marrying his cousin to a Martell, and kept the extremely competent Viserys as hand. He locked his sisters in the Maidenvault which was horrible but didn't truly impact the realm and built the great sept of baelor which in the long run paid off as the small folk like it. He gets marked off by a bunch of crazy decisions involving outlawing prostitution, emptying the treasury, etc. 

10) Aegon V 

Aegon became king with the goal of making the lives of peasants better. Unfortunately, he allowed his children to break their marriage pacts, causing a short war with the Baratheons and a loss of much support. He defeated the 4th Blackfyre rebellion but did not see the threat in the ninepenny kings, allowing them to grow stronger. His final act resulted in the death of him, his son, and Duncan the Tall when he tried to hat he dragons. He does get a few points, however, from punishing Bloodraven for breaking the crowns word. 

11) Aerys I

Aerys became king after the great spring sickness killed his father and two nephews. He didn't care about the details of ruling which allowed Dagon Greyjoy to raid the west and he allowed Bittersteel to be sent to the wall rather than executed. This allowed him to escape and launch another rebellion. 

12) Daeron I

Immediately after becoming king Daeron planned to invade Dorne. He was a military genius and made a great strategy that allowed Dorne to be conquered with only 10,000 losses, but he didn't understand that Dorne cannot be held and tens of thousands died holding it, including himself. He did not ever put the Targaryen rule in danger, however, which is why he is this far up. 

13) Aenys I

Probably the weakest king to ever sit the Iron Throne, he chose to marry his children, causing a revolt. He then failed to put it out, rather choosing to flee to dragonstone while the entire kingdom rose against him and where he died. Before this four smaller rebellions were mounted against him, all of which were put out by his allies rather than himself. 

14) Maegor the Cruel 

Maegor became king after his brother died following the faith's revolt. He decisively destroyed the armies of the faith, but refused to make peace and brought the crown deeply into debt as he fought to stop the raids. He also killed his nephew for defying his unlawful reign. 

15) Aegon IV 

Aegon probably killed his father to rule and quickly fathered many bastards and brought the crown deeply into debt. On his deathbed, as he died from his own flesh rotting, he legitimized all of his bastards, starting rebellions that all of his Targaryen successors would either fight in (Aerys II) or would have to wage war with. 

16) Aegon II

Aegon attempted to usurp his sisters rule and in the war that followed both of them died, as did virtually all of the dragons, something which would haunt the Targaryens for generations.

17) Aerys II

If you result in your monarchy's fall you have to be last. Aerys killed Richard Stark, his son Brandon, the heir to the vale Elbert Arryn, and then demanded the deaths of Robert and Eddard for no reason. This caused a rebellion that he failed to realize was a threat until it was too late.

567,"(I was watching a YT vid by The Disputed Lands on dragons and this struck me. I commented there, realized the length of the comment, and decided to cross-post it here. Apologies, my first post, and I don't use Reddit hardly ever, but as a Biologist I got excited. For reference, I have a degree in Biology with a heavy course load in genetics.)

I can't remember if the exact number of dragons brought to Dragonstone by the Targ exodus from Valyria was mentioned, but if I recall by the time of the Targ civil war, it was 20-22 active hatched dragons, with who knows how many eggs. That makes me think that the number of dragons on Dragonstone at the exodus was quite small, especially since the only dragons mentioned during Aegon's conquest are Aegon's, Rhaenys', and Visenya's. Balerion was said to be the largest, and based on a quote from - I think - Jorah in the books to Dany, the Targ dragons were war dragons, meaning to me as a Biologist, that they were of one specific stock of dragon that was bred for war. So already by the time of the Doom, the Targ dragons had a lower genetic pool than dragons in general pre-Doom. The genetic bottlenecking that would occur post-Doom is STAGGERING, and if we assume there was only 3 dragons post-Conquest and that the 20-22 dragons of the Dance were descended from those three... well, shit, it is no wonder that dragons went extinct. Let me explain.

There is a concept called Minimum Viable Population. This is the minimum amount a population needs to maintain genetic diversity in the wild. Populations that are lower than the MVP are at serious risk of extinction due to a lack of gene flow and the prevalence of inbreeding. Inbreeding introduces into a population 1) physical deformations (the smaller size of dragons after Balerion, the complete breakdown and regression of dragons born post-Dance), 2) higher propensity of mental disorder (Cannibal and Silverwing), 3) Lower immune system and genetic defect (Again, post-Dance dragons), and 4) Infertility, including stillborn offspring (Dragon eggs not hatching, hatching malformed, or eggs not being laid at all). There is another term called the co-efficient of inbreeding that refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or having trouble conceiving/being infertile when the offspring of inbreeding. There's lots of calculation that goes into it, but the more successive generations of inbreeding you have, the higher and higher the co-efficient of inbreeding becomes, making it so ridiculously likely over generations without any gene flow (genes being added to the population from another group of the same species) that the chance of getting dragon offspring that are completely fucked after only a couple generations at this level of inbreeding are pretty much guaranteed. Post-Dance, the only dragons left were Cannibal, Silverwing, Sheepstealer, and Morning, with the only one in Targ hands being Morning. So all they had was Morning, an incredibly inbred dragon, and a bunch of ridiculously inbred eggs. In fact, it really does not take much inbreeding at all to result in infertility and stillborn offspring, especially with successive generations of direct sibling-sibling marriage. The only way to reset the co-efficient of inbreeding in a population is by adding new genes from a new population, which the Targ's NEVER DID because all the other dragons of Valyria WERE FREAKIN' ASHES, YO! (Biology gets me excited, I do not apologize)

So what if there was no grand conspiracy to destroy the Targ dragons? The Maesters didn't even NEED to poison them, if they did so. The Targ dragons were screwed the moment Valyria fell, because their population was no longer genetically viable. They went the same way as the tasmanian devil, and the same way that so many endangered species in the real world are going currently. A species cannot survive on that small a population, and with the kind of author GRRM is and how he's included so many biological and evolution-based concepts in his worldbuilding, he HAD to have known that. It feels pretty on purpose, especially considering:

DANY'S DRAGONS.

Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal are never described as deformed, or ill, or anything that would worry about genetic defects in them. Drogon is even described as the second coming of Balerion. WELL, if we consider the Elissa Farman story and link the dragon eggs she sold to fund her expedition to Dany's three, it makes perfect sense. Elissa was born in 29 AC, making her 25 years old when she cold the 3 eggs in 54 AC. Dragon eggs can last a long time before hatching, as evidenced in Dany's dragons (I dunno if there's reference to the length of time of hatching other eggs, so that's the reference I have). The eggs were specifically from Dreamfyre's clutch, who I couldn't find a hatch date for Dreamfyre except that it was during Aegon I's reign. So if we assume Dany's dragon eggs were the one's Elissa sold, that puts those eggs at between about 250-300 years old by the time Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal hatched from them. This, coupled with them being from Dreamfyre's clutch, who was only separated from Valyrian stock by about 100-150 years, and there is nothing I know of stating how long Dreamfyre was an egg or which dragons she descended from, it is definitely probable and, in my opinion, quite likely that the reason Dany's dragons ARE healthy when the latter Targ dragons were not is because their co-efficient of inbreeding is magnitudes smaller than the last dragons, who were all deformed and stillborn (and Dany's dragons are war dragons as well, further linking her eggs to Elissa's).

They could have saved their dragons had there just been more of them to breed between, or if they'd found eggs somewhere else, anywhere else, to inject new genes into the system.

This goes even FURTHER, because of the Targ's own inbreeding. Plenty had trouble conceiving or had malformed or genetically weak/ill children, right? But they DID occasionally outbreed with other families. And madness is associated with the family, and what was one sign of inbreeding? Increase in mental illnesses. Now, we don't know how things will play out in the books, obviously, and I hope it's a lot different than the show. The last inbreeding reset in the Targ line was Aegon V marrying out to Betha Blackwood. That, essentially, wipes the slate clean there. But Aegon's children married (Jaehaerys II and Shaera), and then THEIR children married (Aerys II and Rhaella), making Daenerys's co-efficient of inbreeding so high that it would be a literal miracle for her to carry a child to term even before Mirri Maz Dur. Aerys madness could have come from, or been exacerbated by, mental illnesses inherited through being so freakishly inbred. This does not mean that Dany will go nuts like the show, but it DOES lend credence to her loss of Rhaego (caused by Mirri, I know, but stick with me here), her inability to bear children, and the apparent miscarriage at the end of ADWD. It also helps explain some of Viserys's psychosis, him being a magnitude more inbred than even Aerys. And which Targ-kid has a clean slate when it comes to inbreeding? Jon. Jon would be fine due to Rhaegar marrying outside the Targ line with a Stark, a noble house who \*checks notes\* had no Targs in their line leading to Lyanna whatsoever.

tl;dr

Dany's dragons are strong and not deformed due to them being from less inbred eggs, the Targ dragons died due to intense inbreeding leading to infertility and genetic, physical, and mental disorder, which mimics the Targ line's own difficulties caused by inbreeding as well. There didn't need to be a conspiracy to rid the world of dragons. They were screwed the moment Valyria blew up and the Targ's inbred them into extinction.",asoiaf,(Spoilers) The Targ Dragons were going to go extinct no matter what

I agree he went a bit crazy after his first defeat, burning men alive and letting Melissandre influence him even more but even before that people despised him.

The man always preaches duty and lives up to his preaching. Sure he is brutal and merciless but also inspires true loyalty in men like Davos(unquestionable loyalty is more precious then valyrian steel), he has always done what he is told and during Robert's rebellion and Greyjoy Rebelion he followed his orders without question not matter how much he hated them.

If anything it seemed to me that Stannis was always underappreciated, he held Storm's End for a year and nearly starved to death, not something that many men would have had the resolve to do.  Robert seemed completely unaware of his brother's efforts, he didn't know what it meant for him to betray his king's oaths chose his brother and didn't know how difficult it was to keep his family ancestral home from falling and in the end punished him for something that was completely out of Stannises control.

The story of how Egg sends Bloodraven to the Wall for the death of Aenys Blackfyre:

&gt;Even as the Great Council was debating, however, another claimant appeared in King's Landing: none other than Aenys Blackfyre, the fifth of the Black Dragon's seven sons. When the Great Council had first been announced, Aenys had written from exile in Tyrosh, putting forward his case in the hope that his words might win him the Iron Throne that his forebears had thrice failed to win with their swords. **Bloodraven, the King's Hand, had responded by offering him a safe conduct, so the pretender might come to King's Landing and present his claim in person.**

&gt;**Unwisely, Aenys accepted. Yet hardly had he entered the city when the gold cloaks seized hold of him and dragged him to the Red Keep, where his head was struck off forthwith and presented to the lords of the Great Council, as a warning to any who might still have Blackfyre sympathies**. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Maekar I

and:

&gt;The first act of Aegon's reign was the arrest of Brynden Rivers, the King's Hand, for the murder of Aenys Blackfyre. Bloodraven did not deny that he had lured the pretender into his power by the offer of a safe conduct, but contended that he had sacrificed his own personal honor for the good of the realm.

&gt;Though many agreed, and were pleased to see another Blackfyre pretender removed, King Aegon felt he had no choice but to condemn the Hand, lest the word of the Iron Throne be seen as worthless. **Yet after the sentence of death was pronounced, Aegon offered Bloodraven the chance to take the black and join the Night's Watch.** This he did. Ser Brynden Rivers set sail for the Wall late in the year of 233 AC. (No one intercepted his ship). Two hundred men went with him, many of them archers from Bloodraven's personal guard, the Raven's Teeth. The king's brother, Maester Aemon, was also amongst them.

&gt;Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in 239 AC, serving until his disappearance during a ranging beyond the Wall in 252 AC. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

**In this post I would like to argue (with extremely limited circumstantial evidence lol) that not only did Egg send Bloodraven to the Wall for a purpose, but that they were actively working together.** 

I would like to add the caveat that I found not a single shred of actual evidence (and I spent way more time looking than I care to admit lol) that this was actually taking place.

***

**Bloodraven was well aware of Dunk and Egg's whereabouts as far back as *The Mystery Knight*:**

&gt;""Who are you?""

&gt;**""A friend,"" said Maynard Plume. ""One who has been watching you, and wondering at your presence in this nest of adders**. Now be quiet, until we get you mended."" Staying in the shadows, the two of them made their way back to Dunk's small tent. Once inside, Ser Maynard lit a fire, filled a bowl with wine, and set it on the flames to boil. ""A clean cut, and at least it is not your sword arm,"" he said, slicing through the sleeve of Dunk's bloodstained tunic. ""The thrust appears to have missed the bone. Still, we will need to wash it out, or you could lose the arm."" -The Mystery Knight

and:

&gt;He was older than Dunk remembered him, with a lined hard face, but his skin was still as pale as bone, and his cheek and neck still bore the ugly winestain birthmark that some people thought looked like a raven. His boots were black, his tunic scarlet. Over it he wore a cloak the color of smoke, fastened with a brooch in the shape of an iron hand. His hair fell to his shoulders, long and white and straight, brushed forward so as to conceal his missing eye, the one that Bittersteel had plucked from him on the Redgrass Field. The eye that remained was very red. How many eyes has Bloodraven? A thousand eyes, and one.

&gt;**""No doubt Prince Maekar had some good reason for allowing his son to squire for a hedge knight,"" he said, ""though I cannot imagine it included delivering him to a castle full of traitors plotting rebellion. How is that I come to find my cousin in this nest of adders, ser?** Lord Butterbutt would have me believe that Prince Maekar sent you here, to sniff out this rebellion in the guise of a mystery knight. Is that the truth of it?"" -The Mystery Knight

**Future Dunk and Egg**

[Future Dunk and Egg stories](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ev6g1z/speculating_on_dunk_egg_spoilers_extended/) will probably flesh out Bloodraven's role in history much more (and probably destroy this theory), but as of now we know know that D&amp;E are [heading north to Winterfell](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/eqisf1/what_we_know_the_she_wolves_of_winterfell/) and will like stop near Raventree Hall (seat of House Blackwood) on the way there or the way back.

This story (possibly named the Village Hero) could touch on numerous things:

- Pennytree (Story of the village becoming a royal fief as per Hoster Blackwood in Dance)

- Bracken/Blackwood feud (Otho Bracken aka the Brute of Bracken)

- Egg meets Betha Blackwood

- Ravens in the dead weirwood 

And most importantly its Bloodraven's mother's house. Keep in mind that Egg married for love (as far as we know) and not duty.

&gt;Even his sons proved a trial to this goodhearted king, when they might have been a strength. **Aegon V had married for love, taking to wife the Lady Betha Blackwood, the spirited (some say willful) daughter of the Lord of Raventree Hall, who became known as Black Betha for her dark eyes and raven hair. When they wed, in 220 AC, the bride was nineteen and Aegon twenty, so far down in the line of succession that the match provoked no opposition.** In the years that followed, Black Betha gave Aegon three sons (Duncan, Jaehaerys, and Daeron) and two daughters (Shaera and Rhaelle). -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

***

**Anti-Blackfyre**

Bloodraven's actions are well known when it comes to him being anti-Blackfyre, but Egg was as well.

The Sword is not the Kingdom:

&gt;""Why, lad? You ask me why? Because Daemon was the better man. The old king saw it, too. He gave the sword to Daemon. Blackfyre, the sword of Aegon the Conquerer, the blade that every Targaryen king had wielded since the Conquest . . . he put that sword in Daemon's hand the day he knighted him, a boy of twelve.""

&gt;**""My father says that was because Daemon was a swordsman, and Daeron never was,"" said Egg. ""Why give a horse to a man who cannot ride? The sword was not the kingdom, he says.""** -The Sworn Sword

&gt;In 219 AC, Haegon Blackfyre and Bittersteel launched the Third Blackfyre Rebellion. Of the deeds done then, both good and ill—of the leadership of Maekar, the actions of Aerion Brightflame, **the courage of Maekar's youngest son**, and the second duel between Bloodraven and Bittersteel—we know well. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aerys I

***

**They both made enemies of numerous lords (the same lords or their sons probably)**

&gt;**There were other battles during the time of Aegon V, for the unlikely king was forced to spend much of his reign in armor, quelling one rising or another. Though beloved by the smallfolk, King Aegon made many enemies amongst the lords of the realm, whose powers he wished to curtail.** He enacted numerous reforms and granted rights and protections to the commons that they had never known before, but each of these measures provoked fierce opposition and sometimes open defiance amongst the lords. The most outspoken of his foes went so far as to denounce Aegon V as a ""bloodyhanded tyrant intent on depriving us of our gods-given rights and liberties.""

&gt;It was well-known that the resistance against him taxed Aegon's patience—especially as the compromises a king must make to rule well often left his greatest hopes receding further and further into the future. As one defiance followed another, His Grace found himself forced to bow to the recalcitrant lords more often than he wished. A student of history and lover of books, Aegon V was oft heard to say that had he only had dragons, as the first Aegon had, he could have remade the realm anew, with peace and prosperity and justice for all. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

and:

&gt;Aerys keeps his own apartments, and it is said that he would sooner take a book to bed than any woman."" He filled his cup again. **""Make no mistake, 'tis Lord Rivers who rules us, with his spells and spies. There is no one to oppose him. Prince Maekar sulks at Summerhall, nursing his grievances against his royal brother. Prince Rhaegal is as meek as he is mad, and his children are . . . well, children. Friends and favorites of Lord Rivers fill every office, the lords of the small council lick his hand, and this new Grand Maester is as steeped in sorcery as he is. The Red Keep is garrisoned by Raven's Teeth, and no man sees the king without his leave.""**

&gt;**Dunk shifted uncomfortably in his seat. How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have? A thousand eyes, and one. He hoped the King's Hand did not have a thousand ears and one as well. Some of what Septon Sefton was saying sounded treasonous. He glanced at Egg, to see how he was taking all of this. The boy was struggling with all his might to hold his tongue**. -The Sworn Sword

***

**Magic**

Both Bloodraven and Egg were known to have [""dabbled in the higher mysteries""](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f8a0f5/characters_who_have_dabbled_in_the_higher/).

&gt;**It has been suggested by some that a likelier cause for Bloodraven's rise to power was the fact that Aerys's interest in arcane lore and ancient history matched that of Rivers, whose studies of the higher mysteries were an open secret at the time.** Bloodraven had already risen to prominence at the court, but few expected that Aerys would name him Hand. When he did, it kindled a quarrel between the king and his brother, Prince Maekar, who had expected the Handship to come to him. Thereafter Prince Maekar departed King's Landing for Summerhall for years to come. -TWOIAF: The Targaryen Kings: Aerys I

and:

&gt;There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found himself thinking, as he watched the cage making a slow descent. They would just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen Alysanne had visited Castle Black on her dragon, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after her on his own. Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had Stannis found one egg on Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over his eggs, and **other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery.** All they got for it was farce and tragedy. -AFFC, Samwell I

***



**Bittersteel**

Egg decided to send Bloodraven to the Wall in the exact same manner as his brother and with enough men to help him escape..

&gt;The pretender Haegon I Blackfyre died in the aftermath of battle, slain treacherously after he had given up his sword, but Ser Aegor Rivers, Bittersteel, was taken alive and returned to the Red Keep in chains. Many still insist that if he had been put to the sword then and there, as Prince Aerion and Bloodraven urged, it might have meant an early end to the Blackfyre ambitions.

&gt;But that was not to be. **Though Bittersteel was tried and found guilty of high treason, King Aerys spared his life, instead commanding that he be sent to the Wall to live out his days as a man of the Night's Watch. That proved a foolish mercy, for the Blackfyres still had many friends at court, some of them only too willing to play the informer. The ship carrying Bittersteel and a dozen other captives was taken in the narrow sea on the way to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, and Aegor Rivers was freed and returned to the Golden Company.** Before the year was out, he crowned Haegon's eldest son as King Daemon III Blackfyre in Tyrosh, and resumed his plotting against the king who had spared him. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aerys I


***

**Egg let Bloodraven take Dark Sister with him**

It is [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/97fvfz/spoilers_extended_grrm_confirms_longheld_theory/) by GRRM that Bloodraven took Dark Sister with him to the Wall.

That begs the question, why would Egg let Bloodraven take the last Targaryen valyrian steel sword with him to the Wall? (Bittersteel had Blackfyre and its possible that Illyrio currently has it).

***

**Many Ravens Teeth went with Bloodraven**

I would assume Egg would realize that he was essentially giving Bloodraven control of the Night's Watch by sending this many men with him:

&gt;**Two hundred men went with him, many of them archers from Bloodraven's personal guard, the Raven's Teeth. The king's brother, Maester Aemon, was also amongst them.**

&gt;Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in 239 AC, serving until his disappearance during a ranging beyond the Wall in 252 AC. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

***

**Maester Aemon went too**

&gt;The old man heard him. Though Aemon's eyes had dimmed and gone dark, there was nothing wrong with his ears. ""I was not born blind,"" he reminded them. ""When last I passed this way, I saw every rock and tree and whitecap, and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake. I was five-and-thirty and had been a maester of the chain for sixteen years. Egg wanted me to help him rule, but I knew my place was here. He sent me north aboard the Golden Dragon, and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch. No recruit had arrived at the Wall with so much pomp since Nymeria sent the Watch six kings in golden fetters. **Egg emptied out the dungeons too, so I would not need to say my vows alone. My honor guard, he called them. One was no less a man than Brynden Rivers. Later he was chosen lord commander.""** -AFFC, Samwell II

Egg was willing to send Aemon along as well and this quote by Aemon doesn't completely jive with the other info we have about Bloodraven heading to the Wall. 


***

As I mentioned earlier, there is no real evidence for this being the case and it probably isn't true, but I thought all of these details tied together well. Let me know what you think!

There is so much that goes on with Bloodraven being LC/disappearing including:

- [Trying to Change the Past](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cuuh0y/what_did_bloodraven_try_to_change_in_the_past/)

**As well as the weird fact that outside of Maester Aemon's story, no one else at the Wall mentions [Bloodraven/his disappearance or the Raven's Teeth](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ervxtw/the_nights_watch_and_bloodraventhe_ravens_teeth/). Not Once.** 

(Keep in mind this could be due to the fact that Bloodraven/Raven's Teeth were not added to the story until D&amp;E/AFFC)

But if Pate wasn't killed, he could've potentially become Maester Pate. We've seen a lot of maesters in the books: from Luwin to Cressen to Pycelle. We have Ebrose and Marwyn and Gyldayn and Yandel. These are all very grandiose names, at least compared to your average Pate or Jon. 

I mean, with all the names we've seen, it feels a bit weird imagining Pate of the Prologue becoming Maester Pate. '""My lord, you are hurt!"" ""Get Maester Pate, he'll give me milk of the poppy.""' I don't know why, but I find that mildly funny.

608,"I remember seeing a theory either on this sub or an Alt Shift X video regarding what The Others are seeking.

The theory essentially boiled down to The Others moving south towards the wall in search of a young lordling with the blood of an old and powerful house with ties to the Old Gods, that also wielded a Valyrian Steel sword.

The main evidence comes from the prologue of aGoT. Specifically Ser Waymar Royce and his interaction with The Others. The interaction was peculiar in the sense that there is a group of five Others hanging back to simply observe young Royce, and a single Other duels him. When Royce raises his sword The Other is described as being transfixed on it, and the duel itself feels very much like Royce is being tested.

When their swords clash and Royce’s steel is shattered, all The Others then react with a laughing/mocking tone as if he has failed their test. It is then that they all descend on and butcher him as if he is now useless to them.

The idea is that Ser Waymar was identified as a candidate due to his Royce blood and it’s ties to the Old Gods. We now know it likely eventually becomes Jon Snow who fits the bill of what The Others may be looking for.

610,"If we can believe Game of Thrones, then two of the most significant events of The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring will be Stannis Baratheon's sacrifice of his daughter–––Shireen–––and Jon Snow's sacrifice of his aunt and lover–––Daenerys. The logic for both of these character-defining decisions goes back to something Aemon said: ""Love is the bane of honor, the death of duty."" Stannis will sacrifice his beloved daughter Shireen for some grand purpose, like defeating the Others or to resurrect Jon. Jon will similarly sacrifice his lover and aunt Daenerys because she poses a threat to the security and prosperity of Westeros. But are each of these acts of ""duty"" equally honorable? No!

Stannis' sacrifice of Shireen is foreshadowed by his flirtation with killing Edric Storm for the greater good: ""He is only one baseborn boy, against all the boys of Westeros, and all the girls as well. Against all the children that might ever be born, in all the kingdoms of the world."" However, the critical ethical flaw with Stannis' sacrifice of Shireen (and attempted sacrifice of Edric) is that she is INNOCENT. She hasn't done anything wrong, and so it's not justified to kill her, even if doing so would bring good consequences: ""...what is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom? ... Everything, said Davos softly."" Stannis is trying to do the right thing by sacrificing Shireen, but he is wrong.

Jon's killing of Dany, on the other hand, is justified, honorable, and Jon's ""duty."" Why? Because when and if Dany burns King's Landing and kills thousands of civilians, she will not be an innocent. She will deserve her punishment, and Jon is duty-bound to kill her in order to protect Westeros.

By juxtaposing Stannis' murder of Shireen with Jon's justified killing of Dany, George R.R. Martin will clarify what it really means to honorably put duty over love. This is a fitting culmination to Jon's story, as he has always struggled between the love for his family (and for Ygritte) on the one hand, and his duty to the Night's Watch on the other. Jon made the mistake of putting love over duty in A Dance with Dragons, which led to his stabbing. He will not make the same mistake in A Dream of Spring.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] What it Means to Put Duty Over Love: Stannis versus Jon

620,"One of the things that's so engrossing about ASOIAF is how much it mirrors the real world. Obviously not in the fantastical sense of dragons and ice zombies - those things are decorative enhancements of the story. 

But overall it's a story in which actions have consequences and very little on a macro level feels convenient or contrived - save for one thing. 

I'm not sure how I feel about the resurrections. Party because they've become such a trope in the genre.  But also because to me they cheapen death and robs it of it's finality. Now, it's not like George is  resurrecting every character he kills. I think only two come have come back so far (Beric, Lady Stoneheart) and it's presumptive he'll bring back Jon. 

I'm torn because I'd prefer it that once a character dies they just stay dead. That way one when someone dies you're not wondering in the back of your head if they'll be resurrected at some point. Just like in real life you know they're not coming back. At the same time I love Jon character's and I can't wait to see how he'll be different post death. 

George himself has said he hated Gandalf's resurrection because he was such a pivotal character in the story and losing him turned the story on its head. But I guess he didn't mean he hated the idea of resurrections in general...

Ultimately however, George is a creative genius and who the hell am I to be questioning his creative decisions? Just some dope rambling on the internet, that's who.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) Resurrections
621,"I was reading a tweet from Davos Fingers and u/JoeMagician today, and it sparked these thoughts. Now I am sharing them with you, my blog-readers, and Reddit.

Even as I subscribe to the idea that the [“kingsblood” of the scions of the great empire of the Dawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/fgkmh3/dragon_bonds_part_1_a_game_of_thrones_the_last/) may be a requirement for magic in ASoIaF, the “man of the people” in me tells me that this concept is very elitist.

This brings me to the other side of the thought; I think that this kingsblood has been spread far and wide over the last 10,000 years since the long night, so we may find in the next 2 books that A LOT of characters are capable of magic and the supernatural!

I think that concept may be something GRRM plans to show in the final volumes of ASoIaF. As magic ramps up, more and more people will begin to exhibit [what Varamyr calls “the gift.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f3udpv/jons_second_and_third_life_the_direwolves_of/) Early in the story only certain people show it, but that’s mainly because their experiences as elites make it far more likely for them to develop magical power in this world.

One example is that [Bran develops telepathy from his coma](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ezcrm3/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_4_summer_and/) and his subsequent [sensory deprivation in the crypts of Winterfell](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ezdde7/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_4_summer_and/), [trauma in the north](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ezdowx/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_4_summer_and/), and finally [more sensory deprivation in the cave](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ezdxuw/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_4_summer_and/).  Masked in this story is the elitism; he is fortunate to have people devoted to him, servants, sworn to protect and defend him. Without that supporting cast, he could not shine so brightly.  I’d say that some of his supporting cast may end up being magical too, (even as the others are sacrificed) to underscore their earlier importance to the story; Meera was critical to their survival. I hope she gets a moment to shine later.

Another example is in AGoT, where the fortunate-up-to-that-time [Sansa can watch tourneys](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/evexao/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_1_lady_and/) and  [Arya can practice “looking with her eyes”](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/exfzk0/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_3_nymeria_and/) and [chasing cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/a672ff/spoilers_published_warging_cats/) to develop her gifts, while Gendry has to concentrate on his hammer, and hot pie has to concentrate on his pies. They just don’t have the opportunities elites have.  Job one for them is simply to survive.  While Gendry is implied to have kingsblood, I do wonder if Hot Pie might end up being exceptional before the end. Even if not, we already know that he is an exceptional baker, so that may be enough to prove my point.

Gendry being a bastard actually proves my point in another way.  All these bastards feed the genetic pool of common folk to such an extent that it is impossible that theses genes aren’t ubiquitous in the story.  Sure, [the Starks](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ewb5hb/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_2_grey_wind_and/), Daynes, Hightowers, Blackwoods, [Lannisters, Martells](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b5ehiz/spoilers_extended_a_simple_connection_about/), and Targaryens may have retained this magical blood through careful breeding practices, but at the same time, they shared it far and wide in the blood of their bastards and vassals.

You see the elitism at the wall, with Jon and the recruits and the senior officers.  However, as GRRM points out through Jon’s lessons from terrific characters like [Donal Noye,](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f3h9ht/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_6_ghost_and/) [Maester Aemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/d0khdz/spoilers_extended_the_perfumed_seneschal_a_new/), [Qhorin Halfhand](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f3k30s/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_6_ghost_and/), [Ygritte,](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f3lhet/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_6_ghost_and/) and [Mance Rayder](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f3nd5z/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_6_ghost_and/), they are all men and women, not so different than any other man or woman.  I’d bet the magic is in the blood of the likes of Cotter Pyke, and Harwyn, and Angui, and Dareon, and [Missandei](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dgk56s/spoilers_extended_loraq_vs_pahl_vs_kandaq_and_the/), [and Rakharo](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/e9uht3/spoilers_extended_house_of_undying_visions/), and Hot Pie, [and Wex](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f2hg4h/the_direwolves_of_winterfell_part_5_shaggydog_and/), and Big Bucket, and Alyayah, and Yandry, and Pya, and Old Nan, and, yes, Moonboy for all I know!

And that is the [Bard’s Truth](https://alivealive0.home.blog)!

P.S. I am also a big fan of Butterbumps, so maybe him too.

P.P.S. When I look at my inclusion of Wex in the list, I think of other mutes. It occurs to me that anti-magic Varys may’ve unwittingly fostered the gift in his mutes. As seen with Bran, traumatic experiences can trigger powers. I’d say little birds likely have it! And there’s Ser Ilyn… I should stop there.

Robb stark, eldest son of Ned and Catelyn Stark, was the heir to Winterfell and The North. He was declared, unofficially, as the King of the North by the Northern Lords and several Riverlands lords during the War of the Five Kings. 


The crown is unique and would be easy to identify when described. 

In a clash of Kings is it described as        ‘ an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of long swords.”


As most people are familiar, the king of the north lost his crown when he was butchered at the Twins, alongside his wife, mother, and many liege lords during the Red wedding. 


After the massacre, the Frey’s kept the crown as a type of trophy or to serve as a warning. Now at this point, Stevron Frey, Walter Frey’s firstborn son and heir has died, leaving Ryman Frey as heir. The next time we see the crown is during Jaimes POV when he arrives to help the siege of riverrun. 


On her, rymans prostitutes, head a circlet of hammered bronze sat askew, graven with runes and ringed with small black swords.    

Later

LORD RYMAN crowned me his very self.


This, among other things, infuriates Jaime Lannister. He commands Ryman to leave the camp but leave the crown. Ryman complies by leaving the camp but apparently does not leave the crown. 


Jaime later finds out the Brotherhood without Banners had ambushed and hanged Ryman and his party. This attack happened reasonably close to the twins, in a town called Fairmarket. 


Later on, in A Feast for Crows, we read about The brotherhood without banners taking Brienne of Tarth prisoner. Brienne sees LadyStone heart, a resurrected Catelyn Stark, holding a crown described as a bronze circlet, ringed by iron swords. Stone heart was studying it, her fingers stroking the blades as if to test their sharpness. 



Why does she want the crown? 

First: It is easy to think of Lady Stoneheart as a single-minded vengeful zombie, but she knows Arya had escaped Kings landing and probably Harrenhal, and has used people to spy in the north, perhaps to get more details on Arya and Ramsey’s wedding. Also, we know she has a spy in riverrun, her hometown. She may be trying to save the blackfish, or does she suspect Edmure is to be partially blamed for Robb's death? 


Jon Snow remains the issue. Catelyn hated him and wanted him out of Winterfell from day one.

"" whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the only thing she could never forgive him for… she might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight… he looked more like Ned than any of the true-born sons she bore him.""


It seems unlikely Catelyn would Crown Jon, even though she signed Robbs well, which almost certainly proclaimed Jon as heir. Some speculate that Robb may have written Jon out of the will and put Catelyn as the heir, but based on the text, that seems unlikely.


So it seems probable that Lady Stoneheart desires to find Arya and crown her while taking revenge on the Frey's and other families involved in the Red Wedding.

Remember she was brought back by a priest of R'hllor, so we can assume her Resurrection will play heavily into the fight against the others. Whether that's crowning Arya or John and rallying the North or bringing down the Boltons, Freys, and Lannisters, we know her purpose has an endgame goal.

Beyond that, she foolishly disbanded most Tywins veteran army, leaving only 2,000 behind, half of which died at Dragonstone. Mace Tyrells force at KL numbers probably well over 30,000 alone, and the Tyrell members of the small council outnumber the Lannister ones. 

Mace will probably be named Regent by majority vote of the council (him and Tarly vs Swyft) before appointing Tarly hand, putting Rowan in his spot as Master of Laws, removing Swyft and replacing him with Garth, and then waiting for the Citadel to send Gormon Tyrell to take Grand Maester. Pretty soon the whole council will be his.

If Cersei challenges him, he has her outnumbered 30 to 1 and just locks her up. Olenna would then set up a marriage between someone like Megga Tyrell and Martyn Lannister to assure the continued support of Devans Army in the riverlands.

656,"&gt;**There are no shadows in the dark. Shadows are the servants of the light, the children of fire. The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows**. -ACOK, Davos II

Its Friday (even though the days are blending together) and so here's some info on past/current/present ""shadow babies"":

***

#Confirmed

We get the two examples with regards to Renly and Ser Cortnay Penrose:

&gt;""I beg you in the name of the Mother,"" Catelyn began **when a sudden gust of wind flung open the door of the tent. She thought she glimpsed movement, but when she turned her head, it was only the king's shadow shifting against the silken walls. She heard Renly begin a jest, his shadow moving, lifting its sword, black on green, candles guttering, shivering, something was queer, wrong, and then she saw Renly's sword still in its scabbard, sheathed still, but the shadowsword** . . .

&gt;**""Cold,"" said Renly in a small puzzled voice, a heartbeat before the steel of his gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there.** He had time to make a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of his throat. 

&gt;""Your Gr—no!"" cried Brienne the Blue when she saw that evil flow, sounding as scared as any little girl. The king stumbled into her arms, a sheet of blood creeping down the front of his armor, a dark red tide that drowned his green and gold. **More candles guttered out.** Renly tried to speak, but he was choking on his own blood. His legs collapsed, and only Brienne's strength held him up. She threw back her head and screamed, wordless in her anguish.

&gt;**The shadow. Something dark and evil had happened here, she knew, something that she could not begin to understand. Renly never cast that shadow. Death came in that door and blew the life out of him as swift as the wind snuffed out his candles.** -ACOK, Catelyn IV

and:

&gt;Together they tied off the sail as the boat rocked beneath them. As Davos unshipped the oars and slid them into the choppy black water, he said, ""Who rowed you to Renly?""

&gt;""There was no need,"" she said. ""He was unprotected. But here . . . this Storm's End is an old place. There are spells woven into the stones. Dark walls that no shadow can pass—ancient, forgotten, yet still in place.""

&gt;""Shadow?"" Davos felt his flesh prickling. ""A shadow is a thing of darkness.""

&gt;""You are more ignorant than a child, ser knight. There are no shadows in the dark. Shadows are the servants of light, the children of fire. The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows.""

&gt;Frowning, Davos hushed her then. They were coming close to shore once more, and voices carried across the water. He rowed, the faint sound of his oars lost in the rhythm of the waves. The seaward side of Storm's End perched upon a pale white cliff, the chalky stone sloping up steeply to half again the height of the massive curtain wall. A mouth yawned in the cliff, and it was that Davos steered for, as he had sixteen years before. The tunnel opened on a cavern under the castle, where the storm lords of old had built their landing.

&gt;...

&gt;Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes, and his breath caught in his throat. Melisandre had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe. Beneath, she was naked, and huge with child. Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest, and her belly bulged as if near to bursting. ""Gods preserve us,"" he whispered, and heard her answering laugh, deep and throaty. Her eyes were hot coals, and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a light of its own. Melisandre shone.

&gt;Panting, she squatted and spread her legs. Blood ran down her thighs, black as ink. **Her cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both. And Davos saw the crown of the child's head push its way out of her. Two arms wriggled free, grasping, black fingers coiling around Melisandre's straining thighs, pushing, until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world and rose taller than Davos, tall as the tunnel, towering above the boat. He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone, twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water, but that instant was long enough.**

&gt;**He knew that shadow. As he knew the man who'd cast it.** -ACOK, Davos II

and:

&gt;""It was her work,"" Davos said again, more weakly. Her work, and yours, onion knight. **You rowed her into Storm's End in the black of night, so she might loose her shadow child.** You are not guiltless, no. You rode beneath her banner and flew it from your mast. You watched the Seven burn at Dragonstone, and did nothing. She gave the Father's justice to the fire, and the Mother's mercy, and the wisdom of the Crone. Smith and Stranger, Maid and Warrior, she burnt them all to the glory of her cruel god, and you stood and held your tongue. Even when she killed old Maester Cressen, even then, you did nothing. -ASOS, Davos I

and:

&gt;Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name. . . . mother of dragons, daughter of death . . . **Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.** A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire. . . . mother of dragons, slayer of lies . . . Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness. . . . mother of dragons, bride of fire . . . -ACOK, Daenerys IV

#Current (possible)

**Quaithe**

I don't necessarily think Quaithe is shadow baby, but spawn of shadows basically equals shadow baby (fan made name). That said it should be noted that Mel's ability to create shadow assassins probably has more to do with her being a shadow binder from Asshai (like Quaithe) as compared to from R'hllor.

&gt;The woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on Dany's wrist. ""You are the Mother of Dragons, are you not?""

&gt;**""She is, and no spawn of shadows may touch her."" Jhogo brushed Quaithe's fingers away with the handle of his whip.**

&gt;The woman took a step backward. ""You must leave this city soon, Daenerys Targaryen, or you will never be permitted to leave it at all."" -ACOK, Daenerys III

and:

&gt;Asshai, Dany thought. She would have me go to Asshai. ""Will the Asshai'i give me an army?"" she demanded. ""Will there be gold for me in Asshai? Will there be ships? What is there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth?""

&gt;""Truth,"" said the woman in the mask. And bowing, she faded back into the crowd.

&gt;**Rakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios. ""Khaleesi, better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows, who dare not show their face beneath the sun. It is known.""**

&gt;""It is known,"" Aggo agreed. -ACOK, Daenerys III

***

**Mirri Maz Duur**

&gt;""My mother was godswife before me, and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to the Great Shepherd, and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry. **When I was younger and more fair, I went in caravan to Asshai by the Shadow, to learn from their mages.** Ships from many lands come to Asshai, so I lingered long to study the healing ways of distant peoples. A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin."" -AGOT, Daenerys VII

&gt;No, Dany wanted to say, no, not that, you mustn't, but when she opened her mouth, a long wail of pain escaped, and the sweat broke over her skin. What was wrong with them, couldn't they see? **Inside the tent the shapes were dancing, circling the brazier and the bloody bath, dark against the sandsilk, and some did not look human. She glimpsed the shadow of a great wolf, and another like a man wreathed in flames**. -AGOT, Daenerys VIII

and:

&gt;**""Only shadows,"" Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice. ""I saw, maegi. I saw you, alone, dancing with the shadows.""**

&gt;**""The grave casts long shadows, Iron Lord,"" Mirri said. ""Long and dark, and in the end no light can hold them back.""**

&gt;**Ser Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew. He had done what he did for love and loyalty, yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness. He knew it too; the grey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. ""The shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah,"" she told him**. The knight made no reply. Dany turned to the godswife. ""You warned me that only death could pay for life. I thought you meant the horse."" -AGOT, Daenerys IX

***

#History (possible)

**Bloodraven and Valarr's Children**

&gt;""His hands are scarlet with a brother's blood, and the blood of his young nephews too,"" the hunchback had declared to the crowd that had gathered in the market square. **""A shadow came at his command to strangle brave Prince Valarr's sons in their mother's womb**. Where is our Young Prince now? Where is his brother, sweet Matarys? Where has Good King Daeron gone, and fearless Baelor Breakspear? The grave has claimed them, every one, yet he endures, this pale bird with bloody beak who perches on King Aerys's shoulder and caws into his ear. The mark of hell is on his face and in his empty eye, and he has brought us drought and pestilence and murder. Rise up, I say, and remember our true king across the water. Seven gods there are, and seven kingdoms, and the Black Dragon sired seven sons! Rise up, my lords and ladies. Rise up, you brave knights and sturdy yeomen, and cast down Bloodraven, that foul sorcerer, lest your children and your children's children be cursed forever-more."" Every word was treason. Even so, it was a shock to see him here, with holes where his eyes had been. ""That's him, aye,"" Dunk said, ""and another good reason to put this town behind us."" He gave Thunder a touch of the spur, and he and Egg rode through the gates of Stoney Sept, listening to the soft sound of the rain. How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have? the riddle ran. A thousand eyes, and one. Some claimed the King's Hand was a student of the dark arts who could change his face, put on the likeness of a one-eyed dog, even turn into a mist. Packs of gaunt gray wolves hunted down his foes, men said, and carrion crows spied for him and whispered secrets in his ear. Most of the tales were only tales, Dunk did not doubt, but no one could doubt that Bloodraven had informers everywhere.

&gt;He had seen the man once with his own two eyes, back in King's Landing. White as bone were the skin and hair of Brynden Rivers, and his eye—he had only the one, the other having been lost to his half brother Bittersteel on the Redgrass Field—was red as blood. On cheek and neck he bore the winestain birthmark that had given him his name. -The Mystery Knight

***

**Alys Rivers and Caraxes**

In *Fire &amp; Blood I* we learn about the sorceress and Alys Rivers, who somehow produces a dragon while controlling Harrenhal. It is theorized that instead of an actual dragon, that this was just a glamour used on Caraxes corpse which was on the shore of the God's Eye.

From the wiki:

&gt;Alys sent a captured loyalist to Darry as a messenger the following day. **The survivor claimed that he had been cursed by Alys so that he would die if anyone laughed at his story. He said Alys had instructed him that any man who approached Harrenhal without submitting to its occupants would die. The man also insisted that he had seen a dragon inside. Despite Damon's assurance that no one would laugh at the messenger's story, an onlooker did so. The messenger then choked to death in moments, with some saying they had seen the imprints of a woman's fingers on his throat.**

So its possible that a shadow baby killed this ""survivor""

***

#Future (possible)

**Mel's  Shadows at the Wall/Offer to Davos**

&gt;The carved chest that she had brought across the narrow sea was more than three-quarters empty now. And while Melisandre had the knowledge to make more powders, she lacked many rare ingredients. My spells should suffice. **She was stronger at the Wall, stronger even than in Asshai. Her every word and gesture was more potent, and she could do things that she had never done before. Such shadows as I bring forth here will be terrible, and no creature of the dark will stand before them**. With such sorceries at her command, she should soon have no more need of the feeble tricks of alchemists and pyromancers. -ADWD, Melisandre I

There are also numerous quotes about shadows dancing on the wall, etc:

&gt;Visions danced before her, gold and scarlet, flickering, forming and melting and dissolving into one another, shapes strange and terrifying and seductive. She saw the eyeless faces again, staring out at her from sockets weeping blood. Then the towers by the sea, crumbling as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths. **Shadows in the shape of skulls, skulls that turned to mist, bodies locked together in lust, writhing and rolling and clawing. Through curtains of fire great winged shadows wheeled against a hard blue sky.** -ADWD, Melisandre I

Mel makes this offer to Davos:

&gt;""No."" Perhaps he should have lied, and told her what she wanted to hear, but Davos was too accustomed to speaking truth. ""You are the mother of darkness. I saw that under Storm's End, when you gave birth before my eyes.""

&gt;""Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow? Take heart, then. **Shadows only live when given birth by light, and the king's fires burn so low I dare not draw off any more to make another son. It might well kill him."" Melisandre moved closer. ""With another man, though . . . a man whose flames still burn hot and high . . . if you truly wish to serve your king's cause, come to my chamber one night. I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make . . .""**

&gt;"". . . a horror."" Davos retreated from her. ""I want no part of you, my lady. Or your god. May the Seven protect me."" -ASOS, Davos III

And while he doesn't take her up on the offer, it is theorized that he or another character will eventually take her up on that offer which leads me to my next possibility..

***

**Patchface**

Patchface prophecies the shadow babies (among other events) back in the ACOK, Prologue:

&gt;He knew the phrase, some prayer of her faith. It makes no matter, I have a faith of my own. ""Only children fear the dark,"" he told her. Yet even as he said the words, he heard Patchface take up his song again. **""The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord.""** -ACOK, Prologue

Which I tried to explore a little bit **[here](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dd8dr8/the_shadows_come_to_dance_my_lord_spoilers/)** if you are interested. Basically the theory that a third shadow baby is coming due to the phrasing.

***

Obviously several characters (The Others, etc.) are referenced as shadows numerous times and Tyrion is referred to as a small man with a large shadow (by Varys/Moqorro) but this post is about the shadow assassins/babies that shadowbinders use.

For instance, this quote could reference shadow babies, but I don't think its attributed to anything with Tyrion:

&gt;**""A shadow on the wall,"" Varys murmured, ""yet shadows can kill.** And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow."" -ACOK, Tyrion II

I would think that a fair argument (even though I don't necessarily agree) could be made for LSH being a ""shadow baby"" in a way:

&gt;""Lightning comes and goes and then is seen no more. So too with men. Lord Beric's fire has gone out of this world, I fear. **A grimmer shadow leads us in his place.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII

Another interesting quote about these shadowbinders that didnt fit anywhere else in this post:

&gt;**Most sinister of all the sorcerers of Asshai are the shadowbinders, whose lacquered masks hide their faces from the eyes of gods and men. They alone dare to go upriver past the walls of Asshai, into the heart of darkness**. -TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Asshai by the Shadow

662,"We learn Dunk &amp; Egg died during the tragedy of Summerhall from TWOIAF. 

We know little of what happened at Summerhall, but we do have a partial letter message from a Maester, describing what was happening.

&gt;         the blood of the dragon gathered in one …
&gt;         … seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned …
&gt;         … pyromancers …
&gt;         … wild fire …
&gt;         … flames grew out of control … towering … burned so hot that …
&gt;         … died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman …""

So what likely happened was Aegon V tried to hatch dragon eggs with pyromances, wildfire, etc. And someone would have died, if Ser Duncan hadn't saved them (He was Lord Commander of Aegon V's kingsguard.).

Now, we know for a fact 2 people who survived Summerhall: Aerys II and Rhaella. The entire event even made to celebrate the pregnancy of Rhaella (who was pregnant with Rhaegar).

So all that is (more or less common) knowledge that isn't really a theory or groundbreaking by any means. BUT I do have something, which I haven't seen mentioned, which I thought I'd share.

So we all know the classic line ""Dunk the Lunk, thick as a castle wall"". It's been repeated a total of 10 times in all three Dunk &amp; Egg novellas. I'm fairly certain that Ser Duncan will hold up a collapsing wall (or something similar), just long enough for Aerys and Rhaella to escape to fires while thinking his classic line ""Dunk the Lunk, thick as a castle wall"", just before perishing to the fires.",asoiaf,I'm certain that this is Ser Duncan the Tall's fate (Spoilers Extended)

The Targaryen's ruled for almost 300 years and in all those years there have been a ton of wars so why has no one thought of a standing army to maintain their power?

A professional army with soldiers trained every day would make a huge difference in maintaining order. The major problem all lords face with creating an army is time but with a professional army they would be ready to go at any moment and no lord would be able to raise an army fast enough before the royal army is at their doorstep.

693,"Most of you probably know that after writing A Storm of Swords, GRRM initially wanted to have a 5-year gap between ASOS and the next book, but scrapped it instead, deciding to write AFFC and ADWD as taking place right after the events of ASOS. And while I don't think it was a bad choice, I think there are some negative consequences to how George wrote AFFC and ADWD. So first, let's compare the pros and cons of both the 5-year gap.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Starting with the positives, the 5-year gap would have significantly aged up the main child characters; Arya, Bran, Sansa, and Rickon. With how it is now, all of them, besides maybe Sansa, are still firmly children, and probably still will be by the end of the series. Having an older Bran gives a lot more credibility to the Bran the Broken ending for example, and having Arya be a 16-year old expert assassin is a lot less far-fetched than her being 11 at the time. Along with this, Dany's dragons would equally have grown for 5 years, providing a much greater threat to the Seven Kingdoms. Another character benefiting from ageing up would be Edric Dayne, who would already be an adult by ADWD with the gap. This means he would replace Darkstar's role as Sword of the Evening in the story, sparing us some of the cringy lines and the edginess :P  
Another advantage of the 5-year gap is that it would cut out a lot of the unnecessary filler of AFFC and ADWD. While I enjoyed both books much more on a re-read, there were still a lot of chapters and storylines that endlessly dragged for me. Brienne is the usual example, but in my opinion, the worst was Daenerys and the Meereen plotline as a whole. Meereen in ADWD is a clusterfuck of uninteresting characters and side-plots, that could have easily been cut or streamlined. And for so many chapters, we really get little actual story development. By the end of ADWD Dany is still in Essos, she hasn't even arrived in Vaes Dothrak yet, and it seems like the Meereenese Knot won't be untangled until halfway through TWOW. Splitting the initial book into two parts; AFFC and ADWD, was supposed to be a way to advance the plot, but we have barely moved on in the story since ASOS. The 5-year gap would have mitigated this.   
However, there are some big drawbacks to the 5-year gap. The first is that George would have to spend a lot of POV chapters giving exposition as to what happened in those 5 years. For example what happened during Cersei's reign, what happened in the North with Stannis, whatever has happened with the Others for half a decade... This would have been an awful lot of telling instead of showing, and I don't think GRRM wanted to do this.  
The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that some storylines would be pretty much stuck in limbo throughout the gap. For someone like Arya, the gap works because she would be training with the Faceless Men, or for Bran, who would be learning how to become a greenseer and then the new 3ER. But for Stannis, it's not believable that he would simply hang around in the North for such a long time doing nothing, or for Euron to just chill out in the Iron Islands despite having a perfect opportunity to strike the Reach. It becomes clear that for some POVs, the 5-year gap would have been impossible to write.  
So what would be the fix? Well, the best possible option, as far as I can see, is having a bridge book, that would basically deal with all the plotlines that would be negatively affected by the gap, and then have another book, set 5 years later. The bridge book, let's call it A Time for Wolves, would have the Dorne plot, Stannis, Jon, the Iron Islands plot, Jaime and Cersei (though heavily trimmed down), and Theon. The next book, ADWD, would then begin 5 years after ASOS, with Arya a deadly assassin, Bran a skilled greenseer, Sansa a master player, and the war between Yunkai and Meereen about to begin, better setting up TWOW and ADOS. This way we get some of the advantages of the 5-year gap while not ruining certain storylines. What do you think? :)",asoiaf,[Spoilers MAIN] What GRRM should have done with the 5-year gap

696,"As I've already been fired from my job due to the whole coronavirus situation, I have more time to continue my re-read (currently AFFC) and think about what the future holds for our characters (if there's any - George, I'm watching you). 

Recently I've been thinking about Jaime Lannister, what is his character arc about, the main themes of it and what's his endgame.

 I didn't discard the show in the prediction part completely and took some bullet points from it as possibilities in some of the scenarios I'm proposing, although I'm sceptical that he will go out in a similiar manner for reasons I'll mention when I get to them. I work with the book!Jaime here, though.

So what is Jaime's arc all about? Is it a redemption arc? Can Jaime be redeemed? And is there even a reason for him to feel like he needs to be redeemed? 

Jaime Lannister is exceptionally written, unique character. He's not evil (nor bad I would say, at the core of his heart - He has many redeeming qualities like his compassion for the less fortunate and women, he doesn't lack conscience and he has a backstory that makes you sympathize with him), but he's also not what you would call a good person due to him comitting some heinious crimes and blindly following orders of those who could be easily deemed as bad people - such as his sister or father. Or is he?

Some could say that most of his bad actions are forgivable. He killed the king he swore to protect to save people of Kings Landing. He attempted to kill Bran because his, Cersei's and their kids' lives were in immediate danger. He cucked and 'joked' about killing Bobby B because he was an abusive, shitty husband to the woman he loved and a man of questionable morals overall. He had the right to surprise-attack Ned's men because Cat has abducted Tyrion.

While this is all kind of true, when it all comes down to it - a crime is a crime. He broke his oath to Aerys and stabbed him in the back. Bran was an innocent child, who also couldn't fight back. Bobby B was his king like Aerys was and he broke his oaths by sleeping with the queen and I'm pretty sure that even thinking and talking about murdering him smells like a treason.

Crimes usually end in punishment or/and eventually redemption.

Now, you could say that Jaime is a different person than he used to be when we first met him. I agree. He definitely is a better person now. He tries to keep true to his vows and treat people right, prevent bloodshed... And so far he didn't really fail. He succesfuly got himself from his sister's influences. He's almost redeemed... Except he's really not.

For a person to be redeemed or even head in the direction to redemption, they must realize what they have done wrong, reflect on it and seek forgiveness from those they harmed and themselves as well. 

So far, I haven't seem much of reflecting and all that follows from Jaime's side. Of course he changed and for the better but it wasn't for the 'right reasons'. He was forced into changing, or rather returning to what he once was, after he lost his hand and met Brienne thanks to who he saw the light. That's certainly a good thing but not enough to consider him redeemed. I am also not sure how much of an actual punishment the loss of his hand is given the context of the whole situation, but I guess it has some poetic justice to it after he crippled Bran and all that.

He's now about to face Cat and perhaps this is where the redemption part truly starts but from what I've seen so far, his story isn't really about redemption. It's about identity, self perception and finding who he really is.

When I try to sum up who I think Jaime truly is to the best of my abilities and understanding, I think he's truly a gray person, who's willing to make unpopular morally ambiguous decisions for a greater good (of course, I am not implying that all the shitty things he's done were for the greater good -  just that this is what he's all about) without too much of conscience issues (which nicely subverts Tywin's characterization because this is how he's often seen and what I think Tywin thought he was, although ultimately he was more of a ruthless, powerhungry, cruel person serving his own ambitions and it is known that Jaime has some ""am I or am I not like Tywin"" thing going on). You know, the ends justify the means and all. He's not some dark villain people (including Ned) wanted him to be or rather made him out to be (and he then 'wore it like an armour' to some point), nor is he a ""*Golden Hand The Just* he, and I'd say kind of arrogantly, thinks he is now.

This plays well into the themes to his arc that are rather clear - honor, duty, family (or love) - coincidentally the words of house Tully (in the reversed order) and the conflict of all of these.

Now that I have that cleared up, let's move to the prediction part of my post.

I'm not sure where GRRM is heading with Jaime as there's some conflicting feelings I'm having from the foreshadowing, the thematic sense of his arc and the show ending, that could be somehow similiar to his ending in the books (or it could not). But I'll try to propose some thoughts I'm having looking at the possible solutions from a broad point of view.

If Jaime's arc is ultimately about identity, the logical conclussion is him understanding himself and living it- at least for a while.

I think that, curiously, Dan and Dave came to the same conclussion about Jaime's arc as I did when looking at his character (*cough* of course, their demonstration of it sucked, was rushed and made very little sense in the situation they put Jaime in in s8, not named the fact that he spent all his time since S4 being Cersei's chihuahua - so no challenge for him here, but that's a whole different thing *cough*). 

Could it be that book!Jaime's fate is doomed like the show!Jaime's and he dies under the brigs holding Cersei, his only true love? Meh. I don't really think so.

I have a very hard time believing book!Jaime would come back to Cersei to die with her or to save her or something like that. And then there's also the foreshadowing in form of Jaime's weirwood prophetic dream that he has before he goes to save Brienne from the bear.

The dream is kind of hard to crack. Hard to say what exactly the symbolism stands for (literal others? some metaphor to the ghost of his past? or something else). However, one thing makes sense to me in all of this - Cersei's light goes out first. Then Jaime's. Brienne's prevails. Which I'd translate in Cersei dying first, then Jaime and Brienne surviving (at least for longer than Jaime, if not whole ASOIAF).

I see two ways his fate can go (unless he gets executed very early on by LSH after GRRM says screw the prophecy, gg):

1. After he's somehow freed from LSH, he rides to KL to be with Tommen. Tommen dies before he gets to him. He probably kills Cersei in this scenario (valonqar) and dies in KL before the end of Winds - perhaps fighting Euron.

2. He's somehow freed from LSH. Tommen must be dead by then, so he has no reason to go back to KL. He possibly sticks around with reformed BwB, goes find Sansa, rides North. Has a short lived romance with Brienne. Fights in the Battle for Dawn and dies fighting Others/fighting Euron (if this is the part the show kept from George's outline for some reason)/is executed shortly afterwards for his crimes in ADOS.

There's some evidence in support of him being the valonquar as well as there's some evidence in support of his relationship with Brienne, but I don't really think there's time for both given that I am pretty sure Cersei is a goner in Winds. Of course he could join the living after Cersei dying but I'm not feeling that due to the arc reasons and cutting POVs - I think that we will lose one of Jaime/Brienne - either to Jaime dying or them sticking together until the end.

705,"This is just a little thing, but I’ve recently begun a re-reading of ADWD, and I think I’ve found some subtle foreshadowing for how Jon’s death will be handled. A lot of people have made the assumption that Jon slips into Ghost as he dies at the end of the book, and this will play into the nature of his resurrection. I whole heartedly agree with this, and was struck by this moment in Jon II, in which he tastes some broth and contemplates the difference between his waking life and his wolf dreams:

&gt;The smells are stronger in my wild dreams, he reflected, and food tastes richer too. Ghost is more alive than I am.

At the very least, I think this foreshadows Jon living on in Ghost, especially coming so quickly after we see Varamyr do the same in the prologue. It might also speak to the changes he will experience after resurrection, however. Will Jon be struggling to re-acclimate to the duller way a human being experiences the world? If he already feels less alive in his own body, how will the experience of actually dying compound this? A lot of people have suggested that Jon will become more aggressive as a result, but perhaps the change will manifest more in a struggle to relate to the world around him as he once did.

711,"As i'm sure you all know there is a theory going around that Lady Stoneheart (Catelyn) plans on doing another Red Wedding when Daven Lannister marries a Frey, presumably Fair Walda. But my question is: is this feasible? 

Brotherhood Strength: We know that in the height of the BWB they had ""hundreds, maybe even thousands"" of members, but I doubt the majority of these were of fighting age and readiness. We also know from Thoros that many members of the Brotherhood have left, meaning that while it may still have a few hundred members it is still fairly weak. 

The Location: Another major factor is where this will occur. It will almost certainly be at either The Twins or Riverrun, due to those being the Frey castles and Daven being in the riverlands. The location matters because Riverun has a garrison of 200 men and is where Tom of Sevenstreams is situated, whereas the Twins have 400 men. 

The way in: There are a few theories of how the BWB would get in, the main ones being with the coerced help of Jamie or with a combined effort of Tom and Freys like Olyvar Frey who were loyal to robb. 

The attack: Lets say that it occurs at Riverrun. If they attack here they still would not have to only go up against the garrison, but also at least 25 Freys and probably a contingent of some 50 men at least to escort them so a total of 375 men. Even if they get inside with the help they would presumably be either outnumbered or in even footing, even with the element of surprise. At the twins it would be even worse with more like 450-500 men with the escorts for Emmon and Daven. 

The escape: We know that the Lannisters and Freys both have armies still in the riverlands to deal with rebels, probably near these castles so they can get support. So even if they pull this off, they still have to go through an army to escape.

So before I say anything about the edits, these are not the final product. The chapters have been reordered and I cobbled together a mediocre cover, so they're still readable. The only real issue is that the formatting for each book (the OG books) was different in each PDF, so when you get to where another book would start, the text margins are in different spots.

So you might have a few questions, so here's a few things to explain.

1. I did include TWOW sample chapters.

2. In the stories with the sample chapters, this inflates the page count significantly, as the pdf I got them from made each chapter very long with the text margins.

3. I made this with TWOW in mind. Aegon's story will likely continue in TWOW in Stars &amp; Storms. I put Arya, Sam, and The Ironborn's plotline together, as they all are gearing to converge. (With Euron going for Oldtown, A faceless man being in oldtown, with sam, and Arya being trained by the Faceless Men.)

4. I already mentioned this above, but I find it most enjoyable to start Salt &amp; Smoke after Jon X ASOS/the chapter Stannis arrives at the wall. 

5. The parts are just my suggested reading order. You can read them in whatever order you want, or just choose to read one. I just think you get the best grasp and the story evolves the best in the order I wrote.

6. I did make them Seven books, yes.

It can happen or it cannot. Maybe it WILL happen. But until it does random ""theories "" with no proof whatsoever must stay.



Jon and Dany will meet Probably near the end of  TWOW or somewhere in ADOS . How are you going to make that pairing work ?
Its Wank fantasy ( sorry for my language but you get the point ) / Fan Fiction . 2 Main characters must HOOK UP no matter what.

And people say GRRM is non conventional.


And people taking the show pairing as proof must remember that the show was going for the most casual audience possible.
The Dany Jon fic is exactly what a common tropy appeal such an audience would like.
Also Jon in the show was a pretty boy who could swing a sword and an idiot while the Book Jon is more like Jaehaerys 1.
Good in arms but far from champions like Jaime or Barristan or Robert.
He is smart , knows his folk has foresight and is good in politics
His plan to go and take help from the Northern Clansmen and not rush of to the dreadfort , allowing Wildlings in , sending Alliser away and marying Alys into the Thenn is JUST an example.


While Dany in the show is just that misunderstood Everyday girl who is ""UN CONVENTIONAL"" like wears sneakers instead of heels like the other mean girls trope.

There isn't much foreshadowing to Jon and Dany being together apart from the house of undying.
And maybe the title of the series.

But if both are true then from the title's point of view Jon is the Ice. While from the prophesies of The UnDying , he is fire. Quite contradictory.
Also it is never specified if that person is indeed Jon. People like to think it's Jon because again her consort Must be a high level POV or so.

Look I am not saying it cannot happen but the current proof for it is weak.



The Sansa thing is even worse .
Jon Views her as his sister .
If I asked one of these Jon-Sansa pairers that their sister is actually adopted and unrelated to them , would they ...........? NO !
People also sort of like to put forward the tourney of ashford as proof.
That theory is quite broken and doesnt even parallel completely.



Seeing recognizable objects or patterns in otherwise random or unrelated objects or patterns is called pareidolia.


Also people saying that Jon is a Targaryen so It works must know that Jon doesn't identify ( in a mindset way ) as being a Targaryen. He was raised by Starks and belives himself to be a Stark.


Also such pairings would dramatically shift or change the narrative or tone of the final books which are said to be Dark , foreboding and have a sense of impending doom.
Putting a major love story smack in makes no sense.

At least to me.

It can happen or it cannot. Maybe it WILL happen. But until it does random ""theories "" with no proof whatsoever must stay.

The most likely pairing is Jon and Val .
He goes from viewing her as Mance's sister in law to someone who he genuinely respects and admires.

&gt;What	had	that	oaf	Axell Florent	said	of	Val?	“A nubile	girl,	not	hard	to	look upon.	Good	hips,	good breasts,	well	made	for whelping	children.”	All	true enough,	but	the	wildling woman	was	 so	much	more.
She	had	proved	that	by finding	Tormund	where seasoned	rangers	of	the Watch	had	failed.	She	may not	be	a	princess,	but	she would	make	a	worthy	wife	for any	lord.
But	that	bridge	had	been burned	a	long	time	ago,	and Jon	himself	had	thrown	the torch.

So if you are the kind of black-brother/sister that does not understand the pleasure of crackpot fan theories of the likes of ""Tyrion the time-traveling fetus"", then leave now. You have been warned 

Every time I get to the parts in the books where that annoying little shit, Mormont's Raven, squawks some random thing I foul my britches. Does anyone else have this feeling? Like there is something there for us to find. Now I know about many of the popular theories surrounding this animal. The most interesting of witch is the [""Corn Code""](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/96129-corn-code-revision-8-the-game-of-thrones-exposed/). But that has never been satisfying enough for me. I think, or rather want to believe, that there is a secret message hidden in that annoying raven's speech. 

So I did the best I could scouring the books and recording all squawks. Now, I do not own physical copies of the books. I use the audio-books.

&gt;  Tormund Thunderfist had better things to do than learn to make papers talk at him.  (ADWD Jon 8)  

So, instead, I used [aseachoficeandfire.com](https://aseachoficeandfire.com) If any fellow crows finds one that I missed, please post it here in the comments. I'm sure I missed a few. Anyway. I took these and listed them out in order of occurrence by chapter and book. if the word has a \* next to it, it means that a raven, not formally owned by Mormont said it or are otherwise unique. I'm sure I made a few mistakes with that too, if so let me know.  I decided organizing them based on the number of repetitions was a good bet, and I took those and tried to make sentences from them. I also decided to ignore the words ""Snow"" and ""Corn"" just because. And for a while I was very exited. But it falls apart in ADWD. Oh well. If you have another idea about how they can be organized, let me know. 

This is what I did. Try not to make fun of me too much.

734,"Everything that Jon Snow did in AFFC and ADWD as Lord Commander could be interpreted as still abiding by the tenets of the Night's Watch. Even the fact that he assisted Stannis could be explained by the fact that he had no choice in the matter, Stannis basically forced himself on the Night's Watch. On the other hand, helping Alys Karstark by arresting her cousin was a clear violation of the Night Watch's oath not to interfere in worldly matters. 

While I don't deny that Jon tried to do something noble, he could have taken a middle path by offering Alys sanctuary and merely denying her to Cregan. Jon even incriminates himself more when he argues that by arresting Cregan on the Kingsroad, Cregan couldn't be offered guest right ; not only is the Lord Commander aiding non-Watch members against their political opponents, he is even utilising NW members to kidnap  members of nobility in public.

The northern girl had a wild beauty, as he recalled, though however bright a torch might burn it could never match the rising sun.** -ADWD, Epilogue

**A Small Man with a Large Shadow**

Tyrion ""casts a large shadow"" on at least 3 different occassions:

&gt;""Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are."" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. ""Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs."" And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. **When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king**. -AGOT, Jon I

and:

&gt;""So power is a mummer's trick?""

&gt;**""A shadow on the wall,"" Varys murmured, ""yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.""**

&gt;Tyrion smiled. ""Lord Varys, I am growing strangely fond of you. I may kill you yet, but I think I'd feel sad about it."" -ACOK, Tyrion II

and:

&gt;""Dragons,"" Moqorro said in the Common Tongue of Westeros. He spoke it very well, with hardly a trace of accent.

(1) pandemic disease, aka plague
(2) massive armada-crushing storms

Both tend to be exacerbated by winter. Disease goes together with war like bread and butter--the population is already suffering and stressed, maybe starving. A new illness can knock down a whole city, as we are currently seeing in our own time. 

Furthermore, there are several examples of ill winds or ""divine winds"" or killer storms preventing invasions or destroying hard-built military fleets, cf the Spanish Armada and/or Mongol fleet attempting to invade Japan in the 1200s. 

Certainly Euron ""I am the storm"" Greyjoy could be a precipitating factor. One also thinks of the Stormlands, Daenerys Stormborn and *winds* of winter.

**I think its possible that the Peake uprising was supposed to be another Blackfyre Rebellion/Golden Company invasion.**

***

#Blackfyre Support

**First Blackfyre Rebellion**(196 AC)

Gormon Peake was a great knight who supported Daemon:

&gt;""You can know a man by his friends, Egg. Daeron surrounded himself with maesters, septons, and singers. Always there were women whispering in his ear, and his court was full of Dornishmen. How not, when he had taken a Dornishwoman into his bed, and sold his own sweet sister to the prince of Dorne, though it was Daemon that she loved? Daeron bore the same name as the Young Dragon, but when his Dornish wife gave him a son he named the child Baelor, after the feeblest king who ever sat the Iron Throne.

&gt;""Daemon, though . . . Daemon was no more pious than a king need be, and all the great knights of the realm gathered to him. It would suit Lord Bloodraven if their names were all forgotten, so he has forbidden us to sing of them, but I remember. Robb Reyne, Gareth the Grey, Ser Aubrey Ambrose, **Lord Gormon Peake**, Black Byren Flowers, Redtusk, Fireball . . . Bittersteel! I ask you, has there ever been such a noble company, such a roll of heroes?

&gt;""Why, lad? You ask me why? Because Daemon was the better man. The old king saw it, too. He gave the sword to Daemon. Blackfyre, the sword of Aegon the Conquerer, the blade that every Targaryen king had wielded since the Conquest . . . he put that sword in Daemon's hand the day he knighted him, a boy of twelve."" -The Sworn Sword

Lost two castles for supporting the Blackfyres:

&gt;""Gormon Peake, the Lord of Starpike.""

&gt;""That's down in the Reach, isn't it? Does he really have three castles?""

&gt;""Only on his shield, ser. House Peake did hold three castles once, but two of them were lost.""

&gt;""How do you lose two castles?""

&gt;**""You fight for the Black Dragon, ser.""**

Gormon Peake cut down the Hand of the King:

&gt;""Lord Hayford was a noted loyalist. King Daeron made him his Hand just before the battle. Butterwell had done such a dismal job that many questioned his loyalty, but **Lord Hayford had been stalwart from the first.""**

&gt;**""Ser Arlan was beside him when he fell. A lord with three castles on his shield cut him down.""** -The Sworn Sword

Gormon also killed Ser Arlan's squire/nephew:

&gt;Three castles, black on orange. ""I remember now. Ser Arlan never liked to talk about the Redgrass Field, but once in his cups he told me how his sister's son had died."" He could almost hear the old man's voice again, smell the wine upon his breath. **""Roger of Pennytree, that was his name. His head was smashed in by a mace wielded by a lord with three castles on his shield."" Lord Gormon Peake.** The old man never knew his name. Or never wanted to. By that time Lord Peake and John the Fiddler and their party were no more than a plume of red dust in the distance. It was sixteen years ago. The Pretender died, and those who followed him were exiled or forgiven. Anyway, it has nought to do with me. -The Mystery Knight

**Second Blackfyre Rebellion** (212 AC)

&gt;Bloodraven proved to be a capable Hand, but also a master of whisperers who rivaled Lady Misery, and there were those who thought he and his half sister and paramour, Shiera Seastar, used sorcery to ferret out secrets. It became common to refer to his ""thousand eyes and one,"" and men both high and low began to distrust their neighbor for fear of their being a spy in Bloodraven's employ. Yet Aerys had need of spies, given the trouble that followed the Great Spring Sickness. Summer came, and with it a drought that lasted more than two years. Many blamed the king, and many more accused Bloodraven. There were poor brothers who preached treason, and knights and lords as well. And amongst those were some who whispered a specific treason: that the Black Dragon must return from across the narrow sea and take his rightful place.

&gt;**Lord Gormon Peake was at the center of an attempt to bring about a new uprising. For his role in the First Blackfyre Rebellion, Peake had been stripped of two of the three castles his house had held for centuries. After the drought and the Great Spring Sickness, Lord Gormon convinced Daemon Blackfyre's eldest surviving son, Daemon the Younger, to cross the narrow sea and make a play for the throne.**

&gt;The conspiracy came to a head in 211 AC at the wedding tourney at Whitewalls, the great seat that Lord Butterwell had raised near the Gods Eye. This was the same Butterwell who had once been Daeron's Hand, until the king had dismissed him in favor of Lord Hayford because of his suspicious failure to act successfully against Daemon Blackfyre in the early days of his rebellion. At Whitewalls, under pretense of celebrating Lord Butterwell's marriage and competing in the tournament, many lords and knights had gathered, all of whom shared a desire to place a Blackfyre on the throne.

&gt;Were it not for the fact that Bloodraven had informants among the conspirators, Daemon the Younger could have launched a troubling rebellion from within the heart of the riverlands, but even before the tourney had concluded, the Hand turned up outside Whitewalls with a host of his own, and the Second Blackfyre Rebellion ended before it could truly be said to have begun. **Gormon Peake was among the conspirators executed in the wake of the thwarted rebellion**, while others such as Lord Butterwell suffered the loss of land and seats. As for Daemon, he lived on for several more years, a hostage in the Red Keep. Some wondered at his imprisonment, but the wisdom of it was plain: his next eldest brother, Haegon, could not claim the throne if Daemon were still alive.

&gt;That Daemon the Younger dreamed of becoming king is well-known, as is the fact that Bittersteel did not support him in his effort to claim the throne. But why Bittersteel supported the father but refused the son remains a question that is sometimes argued over in the halls of the Citadel. **Many will claim that Young Daemon and Lord Gormon could not convince Bittersteel that their plan was sound, and truth be told, it seems a fair argument; Peake was blind to reason in his thirst for revenge and the recovery of his seats**, and Daemon was convinced that he would succeed no matter the odds. Yet others suggest that Bittersteel was a hard man who had little use for anything beyond war and mistrusted Daemon's dreams and his love of music and fine things. And others still raise an eyebrow at Daemon's close relationship to the young Lord Cockshaw, and suggest that this would have troubled Aegor Rivers enough to deny the young man his aid.

and:

&gt;""Lord Butterwell wanted a new young wife to warm his bed, and Lord Frey had a somewhat soiled daughter. Their nuptials provided a plausible pretext for some like-minded lords to gather. Most of those invited here fought for the Black Dragon once. The rest have reason to resent Bloodraven's rule, or nurse grievances and ambitions of their own. Many of us had sons and daughters taken to King's Landing to vouchsafe our future loyalty, but most of the hostages perished in the Great Spring Sickness. Our hands are no longer tied. Our time is come. Aerys is weak. A bookish man, and no warrior. The commons hardly know him, and what they know they do not like. His lords love him even less. His father was weak as well, that is true, but when his throne was threatened he had sons to take the field for him. Baelor and Maekar, the hammer and the anvil… but Baelor Breakspear is no more, and Prince Maekar sulks at Summerhall, at odds with king and Hand.""

&gt;""Some will be pardoned, so long as they tell the truth of what they know and give up a son or daughter to vouchsafe their future loyalty. It will go harder for those who took pardons after the Redgrass Field. They'll be imprisoned or attainted. The worst will lose their heads."" Bloodraven had made a start on that already, Dunk saw when they came up on his pavilion. **Flanking the entrance, the severed heads of Gormon Peake and Black Torn Heddle had been impaled on spears, with their shields displayed beneath them. Three castles, black on orange. The man who slew Roger of Pennytree.** -The Mystery Knight

**Third Blackfyre Rebellion** (219 AC)

No mention of the Peakes (or any other Houses for that matter) but necessary to mention for the timeline.

&gt;The Second Blackfyre Rebellion proved a debacle, but that was not always to be the case. **In 219 AC, Haegon Blackfyre and Bittersteel launched the Third Blackfyre Rebellion. Of the deeds done then, both good and ill—of the leadership of Maekar, the actions of Aerion Brightflame, the courage of Maekar's youngest son, and the second duel between Bloodraven and Bittersteel—we know well. The pretender Haegon I Blackfyre died in the aftermath of battle, slain treacherously after he had given up his sword, but Ser Aegor Rivers, Bittersteel, was taken alive and returned to the Red Keep in chains. Many still insist that if he had been put to the sword then and there, as Prince Aerion and Bloodraven urged, it might have meant an early end to the Blackfyre ambitions.** -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings Aerys I

***

**Fourth Blackfyre Rebelllion** (236 AC)

No mention of the Peakes (or any other Houses for that matter, but you can use deductive reasoning to assume House Yronwood supported the Blackfyres here) but necessary to mention for the timeline.

&gt;His rule was also quickly tested by those whose affairs he had meddled in too often as a prince, attempting to reduce their rights and privileges. Nor had the Blackfyre threat ended with the death of Aenys Blackfyre; Bloodraven's infamous betrayal had only hardened the enmity of the exiles across the narrow sea. **In 236 AC, as a cruel six-year-long winter drew to a close, the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion saw the self-styled King Daemon III Blackfyre, son of Haegon and grandson of Daemon I, cross the narrow sea with Bittersteel and the Golden Company at his back, in a fresh attempt to seize the Iron Throne.**

&gt;The invaders landed on Massey's Hook, south of Blackwater Bay, but few rallied to their banners. King Aegon V himself rode out to meet them, with his three sons by his side. In the Battle of Wendwater Bridge, the Blackfyres suffered a shattering defeat, and Daemon III was slain by the Kingsguard knight Ser Duncan the Tall, the hedge knight for whom ""Egg"" had served as a squire. Bittersteel eluded capture and escaped once again, only to emerge a few years later in the Disputed Lands, fighting with his sellswords in a meaningful skirmish between Tyrosh and Myr. Ser Aegor Rivers was sixtynine years of age when he fell, and it is said he died as he had lived, with a sword in his hand and defiance upon his lips. Yet his legacy would live on in the Golden Company and the Blackfyre line he had served and protected. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

#The Peake Uprising

We get very little info on it:

&gt; Tywald, the eldest of the twins, died in battle in 233 whilst squiring for Lord Robert Reyne of Castamere during the Peake Uprising.  Pierced through with a spear as he clambered through the broken gates of Starpike, Tywald died in the arms of his twin brother Tion, who was serving as a squire to Prince Aegon Targaryen, King Maekar’s youngest son.  The prince, it is said, fulfilled Tywald’s last request, and dubbed him a knight as he was dying.

King Maekar himself had perished less than an hour earlier, his crowned helm crushed by a rock dropped from the battlements as he led the attack on Starpike’s main gates.  Others slain upon that grievous day included Lord Robert Reyne.  Ser Roger Reyne (the Red Lion), his eldest son and heir, took a bloody vengeance after the battle, slaying seven captive Peakes before Prince Aegon arrived to halt the slaughter.

The chaos caused by the death of King Maekar I during the Storming of Starpike has been abundantly chronicled elsewhere, so we need not treat of it here.  Suffice it to say that the matter of succession was so tangled that the King’s Hand, Lord Brynden (Bloodraven) Rivers summoned a Great Council to settle the issue.  The assembled nobles, swayed in no small part by the eloquence (and, some suggest, the gold) of Lord Gerold the Golden, ultimately awarded the Iron Throne to Prince Aegon, who would rule the Seven Kingdoms for the next twenty-six years as King Aegon V (the Unlikely). -TWOIAF, The Westerlands, House Lannister Under the Dragons (unabridged)

and:

&gt;When King Maekar died in battle in 233 AC, whilst leading his army against a rebellious lord on the Dornish Marches, considerable confusion arose as to the succession. Rather than risk another Dance of the Dragons, the King's Hand, Bloodraven, elected to call a Great Council to decide the matter.

&gt;In 233 AC, hundred of lords great and small assembled in King's Landing. With both of Maekar's elder sons deceased, there were four possible claimants. The Great Council dismissed Prince Daeron's sweet but simple-minded daughter Vaella immediately. Only a few spoke up for Aerion Brightflame's son Maegor; an infant king would have meant a long, contentious regency, and there were also fears that the boy might have inherited his father's cruelty and madness. Prince Aegon was the obvious choice, but some lords distrusted him as well, for his wanderings with his hedge knight had left him ""half a peasant,"" according to many. Enough hated him, in fact, that an effort was made to determine whether his elder brother Maester Aemon might be released from his vows, but Aemon refused, and nothing came of it. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Maekar I

***

The question I have is what was the endgame of the Peake Uprising? The chances of success were less likely than Balon Greyjoy's first rebellion or even the previous Blackfyre Rebellions. 

While it is debated, the Defiance of Duskendale is another similar situation where the details don't exactly add up. 

The Peakes' chose to rebel 13 years after the Third Blackfyre Rebellion and the events of the Peake Uprising directly created the Great Council of 233 AC.

Then the Golden Company/Bittersteel invade 3 years later.

My thoughts are that it could be one of the following scenarios:

- The Peake Uprising was a rouse and the only real goal was the death of Maekar which would give Aenys Blackfyre a chance at the throne throw peaceful means 

- The 6 year winter delayed Bittersteels invasion plan and the Peakes' got impatient

- The Peakes' over estimated their strength and who would join them and expected that a few victories would ""bring Bittersteel over the water quick enough"" 

***

The Peake Uprising makes very little sense from an endgame standpoint and when looked at in sequence with the other events going on at the time, it is quite possible that it was part of the series of Blackfyre rebellions/invasions.

We have very little information on it and so everything is skeptical, but I think that it is on purpose as GRRM loves to do things like this in ASOIAF when he doesn't want to give too much away:

&gt;The chaos caused by the death of King Maekar I during the Storming of Starpike **has been abundantly chronicled elsewhere, so we need not treat of it here**.

761,"After Jon dies ghost is going to be killed to

A theory I often hear about Jons resurrection is that he will live for a time in ghost and then be resurrected, so he’ll be able to come back somewhat normal because he didn’t fully die.

But put yourselves in the shoes of the nights watch mutineers, they just killed their lord commander and his horse sized murderdog is chained up. There is no way in hell they are going to let ghost live, he’s gonna go crazy and likely kill a couple of them if he ever gets let out.

That’s my theory on Jon going super dark after his resurrection. He’s going to die betrayed, inhabit a wolf for a little bit which will probably do some interesting things to his personality, and then die again in that wolf and then be resurrected. Bonus points for Jon turning crueler if he gets out as ghost and kills a couple of guys as ghost before dying again.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gbj2gd)",asoiaf,Who is your favourite Machiavellian character in ASOIAF?
767,"Hello everyone,

I'm a French Youtube video maker focusing on the ASOIAF universe, and I was currently writing an episode on House Clegane (its foundation, domain, recent history and analysis of both characters).

In this process, I'm gathering as much information as I can because I want to get it right. While most of the historical facts and descriptions are easily accessible on the internet, awoiaf.com and so on, I wanted to discuss the psycological aspect of Gregor and Sandor, who are actually pretty complex characters (well especially Sandor).

I know a lot of people around here are way more knowledgeable than me on the subject, or have noticed certain aspects I didn't think about. So any thought, quote or piece of analysis would greatly help to build a complete portrait of this house.

One of the important aspect to me is the symbolism of the dog. As you know, dogs are closely linked to the family, since it was founded by Tytos lannister's Kennelmaster. It is present on the House sigil, and both Cleganes are nicknames and often refered to as dogs (Gregor, Tywin's Mad Dog and Sandor, The Hound). The dog is the symbol of obedience and docility, and House Clegane is an embodiement of that.

They originally were servants to House Lannister, and kept their loyalty when they got raised to nobility. They owe them everything, and being loyal to the Lannisters give the Cleganes a sense of purpose I guess ? They thrive in being under the Lannisters domination because it has been ingrained as a founding principle of the house, it is just the natural thing to do for them.

- Concerning Gregor, he is the Mad Dog. Just lie an attack dog, he is here to execute Tywin's order no questions asked. Tywin uses his brutality as a shock and awe tactic, almost psycological warfare, and literally unleashes him as we saw during the sack of KL, the Raid of the Riverlands and so on. Gregor benefits from the situation by having an excuse to be let loose and satisfy his need for violence. It gives him a chance to do stuff that he otherwise couldn't (except in his own keep)

- Concerning Sandor, his character is way more subtle to grasp. Just like Gregor, he is here to serve, but also has a particular sense of loyalty. He is (originally) the Shepherd Dog, as Cersei, and then Joffrey's Sworn Shield. Sandor's view on knighthood is one of the most interesting thing about his personnality. As you all know, he despises knighthood because he sees right through all the appearances. Appearance is a main theme on Sandor's character : his brother is a knight, with all that comes with it, but he is the most cruel individual Sandor knows. While Sandor rejects all this fake aspect about knighthood (also wearing a standard black armor instead of his house coat of arms iirc), and is himself disfigured. This disfigurement is a milestone in Sandor's story : he was playing with a knight toy, presumably meaning that he had an ideal about knights and wanted to become one himself like any other noble boy his age. This ideal about knights cost him his face by the very man who became a knight. He knows better than anyone that all the tales and ideals about knighthood and appearances are worthless. That's also why his relationship with Sansa is so important. Sansa is exactly like that, believing in knighthood and tales, starting with the pedestal she puts Joffrey on. But Sandor knows full well how Joeffrey really is, cruel behind the beauty and pompousness of the royalty. I believe that's why he takes care of Sansa like he does : refusing to beat her, actively protecting her against Joffrey, saving her during the riots and proposing to take her with him after the Blackwater. Maybe he sees a bit of himself pre-burn in Sansa ? I'm not too sure, but the fact is Sandor is the reality check between the concept of knights and how people actually are, and confronts Sansa's existing conceptions. Behind his hideous aspect, he is more knightly than anyone. I'll have to reread Sandor's chapters with Arya because I don't really remember the interesting aspects about Sandor's personnality in them.

That's what I gathered quickly from my personnal interpretation of the events. I'll still have to dig a bit more. As I'm sure I missed some stuff about Gregor and Sandor's personnalities and interactions with other characters, I'd be glad to have your thoughts on my analysis and what more I could add.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) House Clegane and the Symbolism of Dogs
768,"  

Now, the most prevalent theory is that the “friends in Highgarden” Aegon counts on is a rival family that betrays the Tyrells, probably Tarlys. The  phrasing  implies that Mace and the Tyrells in general are walking into a trap. But  what if it is the other way round? What  if the “friends in Highgarden” are the Tyrells themselves, acting via proxy, with only the top chessmasters like Varys and Illyrio knowing the truth?

So, here is what we know about Tyrells - Lannisters with flowers. Ruthless  at the Game of Thrones, but has enough PR skills to carry it off while maintaining a White Knight persona. In  the first Targ invasion, they got the actual Highgarden lords roasted and surrendered to the Conqueror, winning themselves the Lordship of Reach. In  Bobby’s Rebellion, they remained staunch Targ loyalists till the end – while  making sure they didn’t suffer any significant casualities.

So  here we have a team that would stand by the Targs - as long as it doesn’t cost too much.

Whether  Aegon is fake or not, they are not going to pay him much attention while the Baratheon regime looks stable. But  when things begin to fall apart, the boy is a good option. Well, not good yet, but viable. However, he is still too much of  an unknown variable, so they pitch in with Renly, while secretly getting in touch with Aegon’s team as a safety net. They  are likely to do this through a loyal proxy family – the  Tarlys. Maintain  plausible deniability.

So, the Renly move crashes, thanks to Melisandre. The  Tyrells do what they have plenty of experience in - switch to the next best option. But  that option is not Lannisters, it is Aegon. The  Tyrells worm their way into KL politics, the better to place themselves as their ancestors did. The  plan is more or less this way – get  the shaky Lannister regime further damaged, get to a position to take over so that when Aegon lands, they can once again repeat the Post –Field-of-Fire performance. 

Seal  the new alliance with a marriage, Aegon with Margaery. Now  this also gives another reason for Joff to be eliminated on his wedding day. Before  the bedding. This  is Middle Ages – if  wedded and bedded, Marg would be damaged goods. By  offing the teenage bridegroom and substituting a little boy, Marg’s value as a bargaining chip remains undamaged.

There  are suggestions that Storm’s End yielded to Aegon. Storm’s End, held by Tyrell forces. (Definitely not buying the Loras is really dying theory.).  Marg meanwhile sets Cersei up with the Moontea episode, leading to the trials and Cersei’s disgrace. Cersei is to be out of the way however the trial  ends, leaving the impressionable Tommen in Margaery’s control.

So, when Aegon and Golden Company turn up, Tommen  (if still alive- unlikely) would surrender, under Tyrell advice. Now  the masks are off. The  “friends in Highgarden” are revealed. The  unconsummated marriage between Marg and Tommen is annulled. (Or she is once again a widow). Now, this thrice-unlucky thing may affect Marg’s desirability as a bride, but the Tyrell faction would already have attained assurances on this score - “she was kept pure to be the Dragon’s bride.”

The  Final Season Smallfolks’ attitude would make sense if the rulers are Aegon and Margaery.  Aegon  would be seen as a savior  from the wicked Lannisters, and Marg is the Westerosi Princess Diana. Now  the Mad King’s daughter arrives, accompanied by an army of savages, fire breathing monsters and creepy eunuch soldiers. Oh, and her adviser is the “demon monkey” imp, kinslayer and kingslayer. 

Dany, scarred from whatever hell she had to go through by then, finds herself “betrayed” by the people she was trying to come home to throughout her life. It  is then that she concludes that she will never be loved, as the “false dragon” and his queen are, and that she will have to settle for being feared.

769,"I know Craster and Cersei are so different that they really cannot be accurately compared and contrasted to one another. I'm pretty much trying to compare ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) to ""Zootopia"" (2016) with these two characters, and this post is probably going to blow up in my face. 

However, they do share some very basic surface level similarities (and a few direct opposites), that I find really interesting. For one, both of them practice incest (Craster and his daughters, Cersei and her brother Jaime) to the extent that it consumes a good number of their personality traits.  They are extremely cruel individuals. Both of them are highly indifferent to the harm that their actions cause to others. Craster and Cersei are also very controlling of their offspring (as Tommen and Craster's daughter-wives can testify).

That is where what little ""similarities"" (admittedly they are so vague, that I don't think ""similarities"" even an accurate word to use in this context) they share end. Craster isn't really dangerous to outsiders, unless they bother him (poor Mance's envoy). He only stays in the proximity of his isolated keep, and fights tooth and nail to be left alone. Craster is also an old man, who doesn't seem to care much of his appearance. Last but not least, Craster is just an independent Wildling who lacks any real wealth and influence, beyond living in a strategic and well fortified keep. 

Cersei on the other hand, is a vain, much younger woman and the queen of the 7 kingdoms. She goes out of her way to inflict harm on others. Sansa, Lady Strokesworth, Robert's bastards, Tyrion, Margaery and the rest of House Tyrell, can testify. At one point, she even tried to have Jon Snow whacked, even though he's stationed thousands of miles away in the most remote region of Westeros possible. As she has far more power and influence then Craster, her actions obviously have a far wide scope of impact. The war of the five kings, and the 7 kingdom in ruin

771,"Historicaly kings and emperors in the middle ages would directly control vast amounts of land and castles. In ASOIAF that does not happen at all. The Starks control only Winterfell and some lands surrounding it (+the winter town). Even the Lannisters one of the, if not the most powerfull house in the seven kingdoms controls only casterly rock (+lands surrounding it). Even Lannisport isn't controled by them but by the Lannisters of Lannisport a branch of house Lannister. And this is true about every house. 

It seems like they want a relative-loyalist-friend of the to control their other holdings for them.

An example that I can think of is that when Rosby is left without any ligitimate ruler. The kinds council tries to find the best candidate for the title lord of Rosby. Would it be better for the King just to hold on that title and thus having an extral source of money, grain(food) and manpower. Seeing the current status of the kingdom it seems that all three of them are desperatly needed.

774,"Towards the end of the Battle of Blackwater in ACOK, Tyrion is unexpectedly attacked by Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard and would've been killed by him if Podrick Payne hadn't intervened;

&gt;Finally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted, flat on his back. Balls of green and orange flame crackled overhead, leaving streaks between the stars. He had a moment to think how pretty it was before Ser Mandon blocked out the view. The knight was a white steel shadow, his eyes shining darkly behind his helm. Tyrion had no more strength than a rag doll. Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled both hands around the hilt.
And suddenly he lurched to the left, staggering into the rail. Wood split, and Ser Mandon Moore vanished with a shout and a splash. An instant later, the hulls came slamming together again, so hard the deck seemed to jump. Then someone was kneeling over him. ""Jaime?"" he croaked, almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth.Who else would save him, if not his brother?
""Be still, my lord, you're hurt bad."" A boy's voice, that makes no sense, thought Tyrion. It sounded almost like Pod.

Someone like Ser Mandon Moore wouldn't have risked killing the Acting Hand of the King if there wasn't something in it for them or if they weren't ordered to do so by someone else in authority and power. So who ordered Mandon Moore to kill Tyrion? Lets round up the suspects;

**Cersei Lannister**

The obvious candidate, Cersei hated Tyrion and feared him all her life as the Valonquar who would one day be responsible for the deaths of herself and her children. Earlier in ACOK Tyrion had betrothed her only daughter Myrcella to Trystane Martell and sent her away to Dorne which Cersei sought revenge for by abducting who she believed to be Tyrion's whore paramour, Shae. After this clash, Tyrion threatened her and scared her enough for her to scream at him to leave despite believing she had the upper hand;

&gt;Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen. ""I have never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm. You've ended that. I will hurt you for this. I don't know how yet, but give me time. A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid.""
In war, his father had told him once, the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees. No matter that they're as numerous as they were a moment before, still armed and armored; once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again. So it was with Cersei. ""Get out!"" was all the answer she could summon. ""Get out of my sight!""

After the Battle of Blackwater, Cersei never seems to make any attempts on Tyrion's life throughout ACOK and ASOS, the only time when she shows any delight at his misfortune is his marriage to Sansa. This doesn't make any sense...Unless she already did try to have Tyrion kill by ordering Ser Mandon Moore to kill him.

**Joffrey Baratheon**

Joffrey and Tyrion have a heavily strained relationship throughout ACOK, from Tyrion slapping him in the middle of a riot to berating him in the throne room for his treatment of Sansa Stark. During the Battle of the Blackwater, Joffrey eventually retreats to safety with some of the Kingsguard after Tyrion further berates him for doing so - perhaps his anger finally reached breaking point and he ordered his own Kingsguard to kill Tyrion? There are very few who could command the Kingsguard on what to do, mostly the royal family in King's Landing themselves like Cersei and Joffrey. We later receive heavy hints that Joffrey was the one responsible for ordering the Catspaw Assassin to kill Bran in AGOT so we know that Joffrey has form in hiring others to do his dirty work for him.

**Littlefinger**

One peculiar detail regarding the character of Mandon Moore is that he came from the Vale and everything about his history beyond that is rather mysterious;

&gt;""Sadly,"" said Varys, ""oh, sadly. You might find some kin if you turned over enough stones back in the Vale, but here . . . Lord Arryn brought him to King's Landing and Robert gave him his white cloak, but neither loved him much, I fear. Nor was he the sort the smallfolk cheer in tourneys, despite his undoubted prowess. Why, even his brothers of the Kingsguard never warmed to him. Ser Barristan was once heard to say that the man had no friend but his sword and no life but duty . . . but you know, I do not think Selmy meant it altogether as praise. Which is queer when you consider it, is it not? Those are the very qualities we seek in our Kingsguard, it could be said—men who live not for themselves, but for their king. By those lights, our brave Ser Mandon was the perfect white knight. And he died as a knight of the Kingsguard ought, with sword in hand, defending one of the king's own blood."" The eunuch gave him a slimy smile and watched him sharply.

The only reason Mandon Moore was brought onto the Kingsguard was because of Jon Arryn and as we learn in ASOS, Jon Arryn was often manipulated on what to do by his wife Lysa, who in turn was told how to manipulate the Game of Thrones by her lover Littlefinger. Littlefinger has spies throughout King's Landing and it is possible that he has spies on the Kingsguard too (Some theorise that some or all of the Kettleback Brothers are on his payroll) - what if Mandon Moore was working on Littlefinger's orders and was instructed to kill Tyrion? After all, Littlefinger had tried to get Tyrion killed in AGOT by lying that he was responsible for trying to kill Bran in AGOT and then tries again to have him killed by framing him for Joffrey's death later in ASOS. None of this would be out of Littlefinger's character and he seems to see Tyrion as an obstacle to his plans so having him killed during this battle would benefit him greatly.

**The Merlings**

Time for the tinfoil on this one - some have excellently theorised that Mandon Moore is one of several characters in the series who is secretly a merling and sought to kill Tyrion for setting his home, the ocean, on fire with wildfire. Mandon Moore is referred to repeatedly as having dead eyes or fish eyes and if Varys is also a merling too like some theorise, he could've been working with him on this...

**Conclusion**

Personally I'm leaning towards it being Cersei as the obvious candidate who clearly wanted revenge on Tyrion for sending Myrcella away and threatening her right before the big battle but often in ASOIAF, the answer isn't always so obvious.

796,"Rhaegar &amp; Lyanna elope. Aerys executes Rickard &amp; Brandon Stark. If at this point, instead of going to the Trident, Rhaegar deposes his dad &amp; becomes King, what alliances develop in Westeros?

Personal thoughts:

Catelyn still marries Ned. A very angry &amp; publicly humiliated Robert is forced to marry someone else. With Rhaegar on the throne this isn’t Cersei, because Robert isn’t King so no need for Lannister loyalty to him.  

Rhaegar would perhaps want to keep Robert close in order to mollify him, and there’s 1 person who he could marry that would keep him close to Rhaegar and who would empathise with his being spurned: Elia. If Rhaegar didn’t disinherit her children, then Queen Mother of Westeros would be a good marriage prospect for Robert, politically if not biologically, and her developed infertility may not be public knowledge, plus no heirs would end Robert’s line’s rival claim.

Tywin would want his daughter to wield influence, especially if he hoped to pass Tyrion over for her for Casterly Rock. With Targaryens &amp; Robert spoken for, Stannis likely attainted, and Renly too young, the next best option is Oberyn Martell, 2nd in line to the Iron Throne after the Targaryens and Baratheons, and had already been a suitor for Cersei. This marriage would now likely go ahead as Tywin would have no better options.  

In this scenario, by the time of the War of the 5 Kings:  

King Rhaegar lives in King's Landing with his wife Lyanna and his children Rhaenys, Aegon &amp; Jon, whose name is probably Jaehaerys or some such.

Ned &amp; Catelyn &amp; their 5 kids still live in Westeros with Theon. Their marriage is untroubled by bastards and Ned’s nephew is openly part of the royal family.  

Aerys, probably confined to Dragonstone with Rhaella &amp; Viserys, may still have been angry enough to do what he did to Rhaella to conceive Daenerys. The family grows up in relative comfort but living with an abuser, and Viserys &amp; Daenerys would still theoretically be in line to the throne after Rhaegar’s kids (in that the no Iron Throne queens law isn’t untouchable.)

Robert lives drunkenly and bitterly in Storm’s End, hating Rhaegar but unable to mount a rebellion. Elia may well have died of her ill health by this point. Perhaps Robert sends Renly to the Free Cities to drum up anti-Targaryen support.  

Cersei and Oberyn have several daughters in Sunspear: with Jaime stuck in King’s Landing and Oberyn not pining for another, it’s unlikely she wouldn’t have his children.  

With no Baratheons to join with, the Starks and Rhaegar may come to an arrangement as redress for Aerys killing Rickard and Brandon. With Robb likely betrothed to a bannerman’s daughter, such as Dacey Mormont, Ned would want Sansa to be joined to a great house, and Rhaegar would probably offer Aegon for her. No blood relation (which is a turnoff for Starks) and he’s her cousin’s brother (keeping the bloodlines close, a turn on for Targaryens). Arya gets fostered in Dorne and Bran goes to the Eyrie, where Lysa Tully may still have been forced to marry Jon Arryn even without the rebellion succeeding, due to dynasty concerns, Tully ambitions, and Hoster wanting to neutralise Littlefinger.  

The only major mainland family at this point not accounted for is the Tyrells, who would be ambitious enough to want close ties to the throne, and the closest option left is to arrange marriage between Margaery and Jon. They might also try to shore this up by marrying Willas to Rhaenys.  

It’s possible that the increase in White Walker activity is due to the fall of the Targaryens from power, which would make it not problematic for Jon not to be in the Night’s Watch. Instead, Benjen Stark may take his role, if he still joins it out of shame at keeping Lyanna’s affair secret and enabling his brother and dad to get killed.  

When Edmure Tully comes of age, there are not many eligible women in high houses left available, but maybe marrying him to Asha Greyjoy would forestall further Ironborn rebellions.  

When Littlefinger and Lysa come to plot against the Iron Throne, it would perhaps involve pinning the murder of Rhaegar’s hand (possibly Jon Connington) on Robert Baratheon. If this is not Jon Arryn, they’d kill him as well, and suggest Ned as a replacement, to give Littlefinger a shot at Catelyn. With Renly poised to lead a Blackfyre-style rebellion with Varys’s help, possibly with the aim of marrying Renly to Rhaenys and raising Illyrio’s son to be Renly's Hand, Littlefinger’s goal would likely be to wipe out the Targaryens, Baratheons, Martells and Ned, seize the throne through his Arryn connections, dispose of Lysa and marry Catelyn.

Horrifying thought: Egg had 7 dragon eggs at Summerhall. I believe he was going to sacrifice Rhaegar, but what if not only him?

What if the reason Egg invited so many Targaryens to Summerhall was he was planning to kill seven members of his own family in order, so they'd all die kings. Himself, then Duncan, then Jaehaerys, then Aerys, then Rhaegar, then Rhaella, then Shaera? Leaving Rhaelle Baratheon with 7 dragons.

801,"I've seen lots of theories about why the White Walkers are returning now after thousands of years, and I've subscribed to several in varying degrees. But none as much as this one: the Walkers return because of the decline of the Dragons (capital D intentional).

The White Walkers were last known to be majorly active 8,000 years ago, but there's no record of exactly when they were last as active as they are by AGOT. Valyria was ruled by dragonriders since 5,000 years ago, and at some point the White Walkers retreated into myth.

A freehold with thousands of dragonriders might be just the kind of necessary, powerful magic and fiery military might to quell the White Walkers and make them so dormant as to pass into myth. Then for whatever reason the Doom of Valyria happens and only the Targaryens are left, but they still have dragons and are now a lot closer to the Wall than when they were in Valyria. When they conquer Westeros, that's even more the case.

Then through politics all the literal dragons die out, severely weakening the dragon resistance against the Walkers, but the metaphorical dragons (who are often said to be dragons in human form) are still around and powerful.

Then we get to Robert's Rebellion, whereafter all Targaryens are killed except for three (assuming fAegon is a Blackfyre and not counting the A+J=T theory; even if fAegon is rAegon he's not in Westeros during AGOT so far from the Walkers), and only one of them is in Westeros, and doesn't know his heritage.

I would think Robert's Rebellion and the decimation of the Targaryens and their power is what triggers enough of an increase in White Walker activity: with no conscious metaphorical dragons left in Westeros, they start to spill out across the lands beyond the Wall again, triggering wildling flights and alliances.

Perhaps the Children of the Forest needed Stark ice to save them from the Andal fire, but then Targaryen fire to save them from the Walker ice.

The entire Reach host of was holed up trying to take a 500 guarded castle using starve them out tactic, and in that period not a single Reach general, not even the experienced ones like Randyl didn't think about sending a part of their army to help Rheagar? Even just 10 percent of the army would have been a huge help at the Trident. Why bother having such a large army if you plan to take the castle until the defenders have already died?

I get that Mace is an idiot but still part of me thinks its just way too convenient that not even Randyl would do nothing and waste time. There could have been a better written reason like Mace having to divert forces to suppress anti loyalists uprisings among some of the Reach houses or something along those lines.",asoiaf,(Spoilers extended) The Reach in Roberts rebellion was nerfed

Are  the Basilisk Islanders a somewhat single ethnicity (with plenty of   outside mixture), or are they just a motley collection of criminals from   all across the known world? From what little is described in the  books,  do these corsairs have a culture of their own (i.e., their own  set of  religion, customs, rituals, or even raising families of their  own etc.)?  Or are they just an aforementioned temporary band of  criminals, just  exploiting the Basilisks Isles as a passing hiding  spot?

On another note, from what  very little information we have available,  what do you imagine the  Corsairs of the Basilisk Isles looking like?

816,"I find it ironic people look at the north like it's full of pure loyalty and strong even though their seems to be a lot more traitors than almost any other realm and in terms of strength, well ask yourself who lives in the one of the poorest, coldest regions just as the wildlings were driven out by being weak so to is the north because really, which other kingdom starves so much every winter it's expected for old men to ''go hunting''?

Then their is the free ride that is the night's watch, outsourcing the border wars with the wildlings for millennia, sure the white walkers are coming back but for thosands of years manpower flowed to their northern front, you don't see the stormlands having their own holy order defended them from essoi slavers do you?

Also like 80% of the current watch is from the south, with them being led by some nobles.

Here is a list of of non northenr night watchmen.
From the men of the NW we know

Sam - Reach

Aemon - Crown lands.

Noye - Storm Lands

Royce - Vale

Mallister - Rivers

Pyke - Iron Ilands

Endrew Tarth - Storm Lands

All nine companions of Jon are southeners (Grenn, Pyp Toddler) since only Jon and Sam made their vowe to a tree,

Satin - Oldtown

Thorne - Crownlands

Ryyker - Crownlands

Smallwood - Rivers

Dolorous Edd - Vale

Slynt - Crown Lands

Yarwyck - Westerlands

Donnel Hill - Westerlands

Tim Stone - Vale

Wallace Massey - Storm.Lands?

Alan from Rosby - Crown Lands

Unlist two Garths from the Reach.

Black Jack Bulwer - The Reach

Ser Glendon Hewett - the Reach

Gared - the Crownlands

Wyl - the Riverlands

Chett - the Riverlands

Daeron - Reach

Dalbridge - Crownlands

Ulmer - Crownlands

Aladale Wynch - Iron Ilands

Spoted Pate of Maidenpool- Crown Lands

Jafer Flowers - Reach

Will - Riverlands

Conwy from Fair Iland - Westerlands

It is clear the lack of Northeners besides Mormont, Benjen and Marsh and a couple more. No big or small houses of the north have men there, and also is pretty clear they just dont send them their criminals. Even when the north is the region with the hardest winter and the watch should be seen as a good job...''apparently''.



Then, we also see during ADOD that the North still had plenty of human resources when Aemon cried for help, but none of their chiefs gave a damn. Clans had 3000 men really close, Karstarks 700 and Umbers enough to play in both sides...and lets not even talk about Manderly.

I find it funny GreatJon independence speech, when he asks why Stannis (or Renly) should rule him when they do not know nothing about the NW, the Wall or the Wolves forest. Its funny, now that he is imprisoned thanks to his southern ambitious, that Stannis saved the wall, his own Umbers land and keep from a wilding invasion, and is now in the said forest, trying to free WF and Neds girl.


Indeed while we are on it we know their are at least three houses on Skagos, yet not one of them went south to fight the war and the Ryswell's only sent as few as men as possible.

Indeed while many people sneer at the south as a place without honour it seems the game might be even worse in the north.",asoiaf,North full of traitors and weaklings?(Spoilers Extended)
819,"This probably belongs more in the show subreddit, but I wanted to post here for the chance of less die hard Daenerys fans

I just have a hard time understanding why so many people STILL feel the need to defend Daenerys' actions in the show that clearly turned out to have been dumb decisions. like burning the Tarlys alive immediately after the battle or completely torching King's Landing

people always bring up Arya and how she kills people and no one seems to chastise her for it. well Arya makes it clear upfront that she wants to kill people and be a ruthless person. Daenerys says that she wants to be different than other rulers and do good things, then kills people who didn't necessarily deserve it and continues to believe she is righteous and holier than thou

Daenerys having those 163 random masters crucified was rather cruel and bad for long term success. especially if Hizdahr was telling the truth and if there were others like his father who were masters that did not agree with those children being crucified and posted on the road

people always love to say that Daenerys had people who ""betrayed"" her and went against her killed, just like ""everyone else"" in the story. well, most of the people who do things like that in ASOIAF are characters who are not seen as the best example to follow. Tywin was ruthless and though he was effective, he wasn't portrayed as someone you want to be like. Cersei would do the same, and the same applies for her. the Boltons would do the same, and the same applies for them. Stannis had people executed and specifically burned at the stake, and it resulted in people not liking him and leaving his cause. and when Daenerys burned the Tarlys alive, they weren't ""betraying"" her like some people say nor did they commit treason because she was not their ruler to commit treason against. but using these other ruthless people who we're supposed to root against is not a great argument for Daenerys when she wanted to be different from these people and be better. it would be completely different if Randyll and Dickon Tarly died during the battle and were just casualties of war. but the fighting was already over and she was the clear victor

they use Robb Stark as an example for when he killed Rickard Karstark. while I think killing him was a bad idea, Lord Karstark directly went against what Robb had wanted and committed legitimate treason against his king. and though this may sound like a stretch, being betrayed by your allies hits much harder and closer to home than fighting against your known enemies and the Tarlys were never Daenerys' ally (in the current narrative) especially when that ally is from a branch of your family tree like the Starks and Karstarks

they'll bring up Jon killing people, especially the young kid Ollie. Ollie was not an innocent person since he quite literally took part in killing Jon along with the others who died. Janos Slynt was a bit more cruel but again he was someone who was obligated to be led by Jon as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch so denying his orders is a bit more egregious. the Tarlys were never obligated to be led by Daenerys to deny her orders (though they were obligated to follow the Tyrells, but that comes into conflict with their obligation to follow whoever sits the Iron Throne)

they may bring up Ned for when he executed the deserter from the Wall. the law of the land has established that the punishment for deserting the Night's Watch is death

to get into why killing the Tarlys was so cruel and less defensible. it was unnecessary to burn them alive, especially immediately after the battle rather than later after winning the throne, demanding their fealty in public of the entire realm then executed. though they were being disrespectful, keeping them as prisoners of war shows that you can be a merciful understanding ruler, most notably when you try to understand their perspective of having a perceived ""foreign"" invader come to their homeland and having to make the incredibly difficult decision to either follow the Tyrells who support this foreign invader or following the Baratheon-Lannister dynasty who was sitting the Iron Throne

also the fact that it was specifically the Tarlys (as bannermen of the Tyrells of course) who fought to defend Daenerys' family when she was a baby. although they were on the losing side and the Targaryens still ultimately lost, the large army from the Reach helped give the Targaryens time for Daenerys to escape and have a chance at life. if she were an intelligent, understanding ruler she would mention this to Lord Tarly: ""Lord Randyll you say I am a foreign invader, however it was your house that fought to defend my family during the traitor's Rebellion. I will show you mercy today as gratitude for assisting to give me a chance at life"". so executing them outright without acknowledging this seems even more cruel to me

then there's the fact that Robert Baratheon was almost in the exact same position years ago that Daenerys was in now and it involved the exact same man and house. when Robert rebelled against King Aerys, he would be considered an ""invading army"" (not literal) attacking those who sit the Iron Throne. Randyll Tarly gave Robert his only loss in battle during that war. yet when he did become king he didn't feel the need to execute Lord Tarly for fighting against him and obeying who had been their king. if Daenerys had been the Tarlys' queen and she had to fight against an enemy, she would expect them to follow her. and this is ironic because Robert tried to have a little girl in a foreign continent assassinated, yet he turned out to be more compassionate and able to think about this better than that same exact little girl ended up doing. if the response to this is that the Tarlys went against their liege House Tyrell, then let House Tyrell determine the punishment and definitely not immediately after the battle so that it won't be so bad for when Sam finds out

and that gets to the best point that makes it so difficult for me to understand why people still defend her burning the Tarlys alive. she literally had a member of the Tarly family as a member of her entourage. it's been a while since I've watched so I'm going off of memory, I don't remember if Daenerys had met Samwell Tarly yet at the point when she killed Randyll and Dickon. but clearly killing the Tarlys helped to directly lead to Daenerys' death which makes it hard for me to understand why people still defend it as if it was not a dumb decision. Daenerys kills Tarlys &gt; member of the Tarly family finds out therefore becoming more cautious of her leadership &gt; this Tarly then begins to plot to have someone else become ruler, sowing discord among Daenerys' camp &gt; this on top of other things led to Jon killing her. of course we do not know for sure, but there is definitely a possibility that Sam would not have been as motivated to have someone else rule if she did not kill his family. so making the decision to keep them alive even just until after winning the throne could have turned out to help her

then of course torching all of Kings' Landing, I've seen some people still defend her doing that. the point I remember most is that the people of Kings' Landing didn't immediately fall to their knees for her which obviously does not justify killing these innocent citizens, especially if you wish to rule over this city and its people. you already destroyed the Iron Fleet and your main opponent is Cersei who was in the Red Keep. just fly right to the Red Keep and take her out without killing innocent people. the Red Keep was destroyed anyway, so if you were going to destroy the castle then just go directly towards it with Cersei there and kill her in it without killing innocent people",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) I don't understand why people still want to defend Daenerys' actions

Roose  Bolton is described as a very cold, calculating and intelligent man.  Yet he orchestrated the Red Wedding, which seems like a masterful blow  making him Warden of the North and destroy Boltons' long time nemesis  Starks at the same time. But he actually signed the doom of his family.  Lannisters lie, as Roose said himself and Tywin Lannister's intention  all along was to put Tyrion's son with Sansa in Winterfell. As he said  North would be weary of Boltons and embrace Ned's grandson. Even if that  didn't happen, Boltons made almost every Northern family their enemies  in the Red Wedding. He participated in breaking of the guest right hold  very sacred in the North and brought dishonor to himself and his family  to last generations. Roose could maybe suppress them with fear for a  while, maybe for the whole of his lifetime but eventually Boltons are  destined to fall with so many enemies made along all North. And I doubt  they would even be able to keep Dreadfort this time, more likely fate is  the total extermination of House Bolton.

So  in short, why did Roose Bolton did what he did? Did such an intelligent  and calculating man did not calculate any of this?

823,"During her walk of atonement in ADWD, Cersei Lannister suffers a few injuries on her lower body to the point of severely bleeding;

&gt;Halfway down Visenya's Hill the queen fell for the first time, **when her foot slipped in something that might have been nightsoil. When Septa Unella pulled her up, her knee was scraped and bloody.** A ragged laugh rippled through the crowd, and some man shouted out an offer to kiss it and make it better. Cersei looked behind her. She could still see the great dome and seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor atop the hill. Have I really come such a little way? Worse, a hundred times worse, she had lost sight of the Red Keep. ""Where … where …?""

Her long walk continues without Cersei receiving any treatment and her injuries grow only worse as she suffers a sharp cut on one of her feet;

&gt;Yes, she thought. Unruly. ""I am not afraid—""
""You should be."" He yanked at her arm, pulling her along beside him. She staggered down the hill—downward, ever downward—wincing with every step, letting him support her. It should be Jaime beside me. He would draw his golden sword and slash a path right through the mob, carving the eyes out of the head of every man who dared to look at her.
**The paving stones were cracked and uneven, slippery underfoot, and rough against her soft feet. Her heel came down on something sharp, a stone or piece of broken crockery. Cersei cried out in pain.** ""I asked for sandals,"" she spat at Septa Unella. ""You could have given me sandals, you could have done that much."" The knight wrenched at her arm again, as if she were some common serving wench. Has he forgotten who I am? She was the queen of Westeros; he had no right to lay rough hands on her.

She completes her walk of atonement with bloody feet after walking through faeces, mud and other forms of dirt;

&gt;Near the bottom of the hill, the slope gentled and the street began to widen. Cersei could see the Red Keep again, shining crimson in the morning sun atop Aegon's High Hill. I must keep walking. She wrenched free of Ser Theodan's grasp. ""You do not need to drag me, ser."" She limped on, **leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the stones behind her.
She walked through mud and dung, bleeding, goosefleshed, hobbling.**

Cersei has walked barefoot through the dirty streets of King's Landing, cut her feet to the point of leaving bloody footprints behind her and her immediate thoughts upon returning to the Red Keep are vengeance rather than seeking medical help;

&gt;""If it please Your Grace, Ser Robert has taken a holy vow of silence,"" Qyburn said. ""He has sworn that he will not speak until all of His Grace's enemies are dead and evil has been driven from the realm.""
**Yes, thought Cersei Lannister. Oh, yes.**

We know how fast infections can spread in ASOIAF to the point of causing death;

* Ned Stark's leg is wounded by Jaime Lannister and left to become infected in the Black Cells by Pycelle to the point of hallucinating and fever, Ned most likely would've died had Ilyn Payne not killed him.

* Khal Drogo receives a cut on his upper torso and dies of infection.

* Vargo Hoat has his ear bitten by Brienne to the point that it later becomes infected and causes death. 

* Gregor Clegane is wounded with a poisoned arrow by Oberyn Martell and later dies.

* Jon Connington catches greyscale quickly after putting his hand in water and will eventually die from it.

From how badly hurt her feet are and how quick infections can spread, it is safe to presume that at least one of Cersei's feet will become infected in TWOW.

But what would be the point of this to drive the plot? It would serve three purposes;

1.) **Losing her foot will destroy the love between Cersei and Jaime for good, both emotionally and symbolically** - Cersei counted on Jaime to come and rescue her from her captivity to the point of even imagining him cutting through the smallfolk mocking her with his sword but he never turns up to help her even after he receives her letter. This knowledge is going to hurt Cersei deeply and if she ends up losing a part of herself because of the Faith and Jaime abandoning her, she will hold it against him for the rest of their lives. It also represents a symbolic point in their relationship, as Cersei and Jaime came into the world  together with Jaime's right hand wrapped around Cersei's left foot - Jaime lost his right hand in ASOS and from that moment onwards grew more distant to Cersei and if Cersei loses her left foot in TWOW it will drive Cersei to grow more distant from that moment onwards.

2.) **It will worsen her paranoia and deteriorating state of mind** - When The Winds of Winter begins, Cersei will learn that her uncle Kevan has been killed and led to believe it was by Tyrion because Varys killed him with a crossbow like Tyrion killed Tywin with a crossbow too, she's going to learn of the attempt made on Myrcella's life in Dorne and that she too has suffered a mortal wound to her body and that her Small Council has been replaced with Tyrell bannermen who she believes are plotting against her. That, coupled with the trauma of the walk of atonement and her upcoming trial, is going to make Cersei even more paranoid and being forced to lose one of her feet to save her life is going to have life changing implications for her state of mind that she will likely never recover from.

3.) **It will stop her from fleeing King's Landing when fAegon invades** - Cersei is going to really struggle with mobility in the next book if she does lose one of her feet, especially if she is also pregnant (we'll get on to that another time but it looks like Cersei will be pregnant again in the books like on the show) and when fAegon does eventually attempt to take King's Landing, she's going to struggle to flee for safety in somewhere like Casterly Rock. Her deteriorating mental state and her physical disability will drive Cersei to resort to taking one last stand of sorts in King's Landing against her many enemies who seek to take the throne from her, perhaps even taking a Mad King kind of stand in threatening to set off caches of wildfire in the city.

And a bonus irony to it all;

**Cersei is going to lose one of her feet after being publicly shamed outside the Sept of Baelor and having her lower leg infected because of Jaime just as Ned Stark was publicly shamed outside the Sept of Baelor and had his lower leg infected because of Jaime.**

**TLDR - During Cersei's walk of Atonement she cut her feet several times to the point of leaving bloody footprints behind. She then proceeded to walk through faeces, mud and other forms of dirt meaning it will likely be heavily infected. This serious infection left untreated for so long and being able to spread so quickly will force Cersei to have to have one of her feet - probably her left foot - amputated by Qyburn. This will symbolise the severed connection between her and Jaime with having her left foot and his right hand amputated and the love between them being severed from that point onwards for them both respectively. Its going to be an ironic twist and will seal Cersei's doomed fate within King's Landing in the next book.**

**Bonus Tinfoil - If Qyburn is working for the Martells as part of the Grand Dornish Conspiracy, he's got plenty of reason to deliberately let Cersei's infection fester rather than treat it straight away and force it to have to be amputated.**",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Cersei is going to lose one of her [Spoiler] in TWOW
824,"I know most will say duh shes drunk, but I think she is drunk to the point she'd have trouble recalling her actions the next day type of thing. What really sold me on this was her sex scene with Taena, the infamous Myrish swamp(god GRRM please don't start writing smut, you're not cut out for it!) scene blech!  Cersei is in her thirties, I can't recall another character ever remembering her showing same sex attraction, and she never thinks about it either and we're in her head, in fact in the same book she thinks back on Rhygar in a way that she desires him sexually. It would be bizarre for someone to suddenly realize they are bisexual in their mid thirties, unless they are blackout drunk to the point of memory loss then pretty much anything goes, go rob a shop with a crossbow wearing only a shirt type shit. The weird and grossly written, and I think its for us to realize shes out of her mind, in modern term she downed 4 Xanax with a bottle of cheap vodka daily in many of her chapters. I think this explains her jaw droppingly moronic decisions like appointing some unknown bastard to be lord of ships, because he reminds her of Rhygar!?!

I can't fully fault her for drinking, people have sank into alcoholism for much less than your first born dying in your arms, second born sent to live with people who hate your family, then your father murdered and you're suddenly in charge and trying to protect your son who is no way ready to be a monarch and is just a sitting duck for vicious manipulators, not even mentioning the walk of shame where unlike the show her feet actually get infected.

I think this is intentional, and a sober post captivity/walk of shame/trial Cersei is going to shock people with her sudden rise in IQ and cunning. Which will just make her more hated and dangerous.

I'm wondering if in the books she commits suicide while using the wildfire if Tommen is dead already.

No, I don’t want to do this I don’t want to I can't Jon thought.

Let us briefly acknowledge the possibility that that might not be true: Ned may have just been trying to zing Littlefinger. Indeed, the text pretty clearly states that Ned is trying to shut the conversation down, so perhaps he might have told an untruth to achieve that.

And now let us dismiss the possibility that he was lying, and instead explore the more interesting possibility that he was not.

Now, the timeline is very fuzzy around all this, but it seems to me like Brandon was present at Riverrun for the announcement of his betrothal to Catelyn, at which point he duelled Petyr Baelish; he then left Riverrun and went back north, where he banged Barbrey Dustin one more time; then at some point he went back to Riverrun for the wedding, but never made it, because he took a detour to King's Landing instead.

Once at King's Landing, you'll recall, he was horribly killed (*or was he?!? O_o*); Aerys then sent word to *Jon Arryn* to kill Ned Stark, too.

In other words, Ned was in the Vale in 282.

Travel times being what they are, it's entirely possible that Ned and Brandon *had not seen each other at all* since the duel with Littlefinger, at which Ned was not present. (Right?)

So, either Ned and Brandon spent a lot of time together in those short months - time enough for Brandon to speak of Littlefinger ""often"" - or, more interestingly - well, not *that* interestingly - Brandon *already* hated Littlefinger prior to the duel.",asoiaf,[spoilers extended] Did Brandon hate Littlefinger from before their duel?

He saw no more of his father, nor the girl who looked like Arya, but a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her.""

I was thinking about this vision in Bran III ADWD. Who is that woman? I had a first thought at Melantha Blackwood, wife of Lord Willam Stark, Ned's great grandfather. He died fighting the wildlings around 226 AC, so maybe the woman was his wife Melantha begging for vengeance against the wildlings. However, I don't know what would that imply, and what's the importance of that. Any good theories on that?",asoiaf,(SPOILERS ADWD) About this Bran vision

849,"So I just started rereading the series again and I got to this part in the story.

&gt;He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.

&gt;He lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea, to the Free Cities and the green Dothraki sea and beyond, to Vaes Dothrak under its mountain, to the fabled lands of the Jade Sea, *to Asshai by the Shadow, where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise*.

&gt;Finally he looked north. He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he looked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.

What does this mean are there Dragons in Asshai?

We know this dream of Brans is about the present since he sees Catelyn travelling to King's Landing and Sansa crying because of the death of Lady.

I figure there are 3 possibilities

1. Dragon's stirred in Asshai in the past and Bran somehow knows this.

I think this is a bit strange since how would Bran know Dragons were once in Asshai? I suppose there's there's the possibility he knows because of Old Nan's stories but if that's true then what happened to these Dragons? 

We know most of the Dragons in the world died during the Doom of Valyria but we don't know anything about Dragons dying in Asshai or Dragons even residing in Asshai.

Well I guess Old Nan could just be wrong about Dragons once living in Asshai.

2. The people of Asshai are keeping their Dragons hidden

It would be pretty difficult to do but it's not something that I think would be impossible especially in Asshai which Melisande says is one of the hinges of the world (the other hinge being the Wall) where magic is still present.

3. The Dragons have just now started stirring

We know a lot of strange things are happening in the world now like: the White Walkers are coming, glass candles are burning, the Warlock's powers are returning, dragons are being born. All of these tell us magic is returning to the world, some people believe it's because Dany's dragon were born some people believe it's because of the Red comet.

In any case this means it's possible that the dragons in Asshai were sleeping or hibernating until now.

856,"Why are the white walkers still alive? They were basically created as a weapon of mass destruction the cotf used during the war with the first men. The children knew how powerful and dangerous white walkers were so why not destroy them after the war ended? 

Then we have the long night. After a generation of winter the last hero spent years searching for the cotf in hopes they would help destroy the white walkers. The white walkers are finally defeated with the help of the cotf. This means the children always knew how to stop the white walkers. Instead of helping immediately after the invasion they went into hiding and waited a generation. 

After the long night ended the white walkers were again allowed to remain living. They had a chance to pursue white walkers and destroy them once and for all. 
Instead they build a massive ice wall and establish the nights watch as a standing army. 

I believe the old gods, cotf, and white walkers are connected, if the white walkers die the old gods and children do as well. Bran will find out the cotf have kept white walkers alive to save themselves and their gods. 

The white walkers were created after the first men arrived. The cotf and humans had no contact before, the children could not have known the effect their magic would have on humans. The magic used to create white walkers had the unintended consequence of connecting white walkers to the cotf and old gods.

So why attack now? The cotf know how to stop white walkers, this process is done by their greenseer. The three eyed raven is the last greenseer and he is only kept alive by the roots of the weirwood. Sensing the last greenseers impending death the white walkers began building an army and marching south. 

Once bran fully connects to the weirwoods his life will become entwined with the cotf, old gods, and white walkers as well. Bran would probably kill the white walkers even if it meant his death.  But what if Jon's resurrection involves the old gods? Then white walkers dying would kill Jon as well.

861," I think The World of Ice and Fire companion book gives us enough information to piece together a general outline of what caused the Long Night.

Here's the basic premise: facing extinction, the COTF converted some humans into White Walkers which pressured humans into agreeing to the Pact. However these original White Walkers - while strong and resistant to human weapons - could be defeated easily with obsidian weapons and could not warg or raise the dead (or possibly even reproduce on their own).

The tale of the Night's King is the origin story of how the White Walkers gained the ability to raise the dead, making them far more powerful and difficult to defeat, and this additional power (along with possibly warging) allowed them to raise huge armies of dead animal and humans leading to the Long Night.

**The God's Eye Pact**

We learn from TWOIAF that in the Dawn Age the First Men warred constantly with the COTF and easily defeated them, spreading across Westeros stealing lands from the COTF, felling Weirwood trees, and pushing the COTF forest to near extinction. Yet, for some unexplained reason, the First Men made a peace agreement with the COTF. Notice the motivation of the First Men is glossed over in TWOIAF with the line ""The First Men, perhaps tired of the war, also wished to see an end to the fighting.""

The most likely explanation reason the First Men were compelled to peace is the COTF's creations of the White Walkers (not the same kind of white walkers we see in present westeros, but more on that later). An army of ice soldiers was a nice way to balance the power of the First Men; these White Walkers would have been large, strong, and impervious to metal weapons. However they were easily killed by dragonglass as a kill-switch by the COTF and likely kept secret from men. It's also possible the original White Walkers were not capable of reproducing. However it is highly unlikely the COTF would imbue the White Walkers with the power to raise the dead, greensee, or warg, as the COTF would not be able to control creatures so powerful.

From TWOIAF we learn the Pact the began the Age of Heroes and ""extended through the thousands of years in which the First Men and children lived in peace with one another"". During this time the White Walkers were likely hanging around somewhere in Westeros, possibly contained by the magic of the COTF, waiting to be unleashed as a weapon against humans if they were to violate The Pact. Perhaps they were contained by an early version of The Wall, a barrier imbued with magic to contain the White Walkers, and perhaps the Horn of Winter was the magical key held by the COTF to bring down The Wall and unleash the White Walkers if needed, though these details aren't central to the argument here. (However an interesting fact we get from TWOIAF is that during the peace ""From the Land of Always Winter to the shores of the Summer Sea, the First Men ruled from their ringforts."" It's strange the First Men would build ringforts beyond the Wall among the White Walkers.)

**The Night's King**

TWOIAF informs us the Starks had a long history of conquest of the other First Men of Westeros, often stealing the wives of conquered people and interbreeding with them. Readers should already be familiar with this Stark practice so there's no need to repeat several quotes from TWOIAF here. The Kings of Winter section from TWOIAF describes that both the Barrow Kings and Warg Kings were among those who submitted to the Starks and whose wives were taken as brides. Although not explicitly stated, it's likely through this interbreeding that the Starks took on some of the magic of conquered people and enhanced the power of their own bloodlines.

Now we come to the oft-discussed story of the Night's King; we'll accept as truth Old Nan's claim the Night's King was a Stark. This tale has been widely misinterpreted as the story of a Stark Lord Commander falling in love and having children with a female White Walker. Except for the blue eyes (which were distortions of the reality from legend), descriptions of the Night's Queen make her sound more like a corpse, as she's described in Bran's retelling of Old Nan's tale of the Night's King as having skin ""as white as the moon"" and ""cold as ice"". These traits are associated with corpses, making it likely she was a sorceress from the Barrowlands with power over the dead. TWOIAF makes this explicit when it suggests the Night's King ""bedded a sorceress as pale as a corpse"" and that ""some suggest that perhaps the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves."" Also consider that TWOIAF notes that after being conquered by a Stark King, the Barrow King ""Gave him the hand of his daughter in marriage.""

So we should consider the suggestion the Night's Queen was a literal female White Walker mere legend. It's far more likely she was a Barrowland sorceress with powers over the dead. Now imagine if she and a Stark Lord Commander (who may have had the power of warging in his blood) had children: these children would have the power to warg and raise the dead. And if these children were given over to the White Walkers as the stories suggest and converted to White Walkers in a similar way to the tv show, you'd end up humanoid ice creatures with the ability to warg and raise the dead. These White Walkers would have the powers described in the legends of the Long Night and seen on the show.

But why would a Barrowland sorceress and Stark Lord Commander give their babies over to the White Walkers and create an army of nearly invincible ice demons? It's likely the story is more complicated and we're missing crucial information. Possibly the pair weren't simply handing over their babies to the White Walkers but using the WWs to give their children ice powers and imbue their own descendants with ice magic. But the process went awry and simply created extremely powerful White Walkers. It's also plausible that the White Walkers were unable to reproduce until Night's Queen and King intervened and gave the White Walkers the power to convert babies to White Walkers.

**The Long Night**

Now considering the previous sections an explanation of the Long Night easily follows: the White Walkers, created by the COTF but possessing limited powers, suddenly were a mighty force of ice warriors who could raise huge armies of dead humans and animals and therefore could not easily be stopped by the obsidian weapons of the COTF and easily swept across Westeros and nearly wiped all life from the continent. How they were defeated is a mystery itself and I will not speculate here.

&gt;**When she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood.**
For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I'm so tired. She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep. Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass, and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.
If she had not been so sick and scared, that might have come as a relief. Instead she began to shiver violently. She rubbed her fingers through the dirt, and grabbed a handful of grass to wipe between her legs. The dragon does not weep. She was bleeding, but it was only woman's blood. The moon is still a crescent, though. How can that be? She tried to remember the last time she had bled. The last full moon? The one before? The one before that? No, it cannot have been so long as that. ""I am the blood of the dragon,"" she told the grass, aloud.

Divorcing the fact that he's a stubborn, spiteful man with a chip on his shoulders (like so many others in this series), offering Mya Stone legitimacy could give Stannis the leverage he needs to get House Royce on his side. In A Storm of Swords, we learn that Bronze Yohn dislikes the way Lysa sat out during Robb's campaign in the riverlands. So there is at least a hairline fracture there. 
Couple that with the promise of giving House Royce close access to the throne via their relationship with his newly royal niece, perhaps even a marriage proposal (which gives House Royce a relative with royal blood), it seems a good deal.  
We know he is flexible enough to make such a deal, as he offers to make Renly his heir and Jon the legitimate lord of Winterfell.
There would be other problems to be sure:
The Vale loved Robert, not Stannis. 
Melisandre's fanaticism would probably circumvent such plans and Selyse would egg her on with Axell in the background.The red priestess would require that House Royce burn down their godswood and give up the ways of the First Men, which is pretty much a no-go. Littlefinger would undermine such action with his spy network and his alliance with Lyn Corbray.

875,"I am just wrapping up a re-read of Fire and Blood and I'm really struck by the tangled Targaryen/Baratheon rivalry/alliance (rivliance?). 

To briefly review:

* **Orys Baratheon**, bastard brother of Aegon the Conqueror and founder of House Baratheon, helps him conquer (most of) Westeros by slaying Argilac the Arrogant, the last of House Durrandon, and marrying his daughter. Orys becomes the first Hand of the King. But in the First Dornish War, he is taken captive and gets his sword hand lopped off. He resigns his office, saying ""The King's Hand should have a hand."" He grows ""bent and bitter"" in his later years, finally getting revenge on the son of the lord who took his hand -- by lopping off both hands and both feet. He dies almost immediately after, ""smiling at the rotting hands and feet that dangled in his tent like a string of onions.""
* **Rogar**, his grandson, shelters Dowager Queen Alyssa and two of her children, Jaehaerys and Alysanne, after they flee from Maegor the Cruel. He becomes the first great lord to declare for Jaehaerys, over the claims of Jaehaerys's evil uncle Maegor and his older sister Rhaena, and in exchange the boy king makes him his Hand. Rogar eventually marries Queen Alyssa, creating a small rift between him and Jaehaerys. It widens when Jaehaerys and Alysanne elope. Things come to a head when Rogar demands that Jaehaerys be set aside and Rhaena's daughter crowned queen. He even sends his younger brother to seize the girl. Ultimately, he kneels before Jaehaerys and begs forgiveness, who grants it, but tacitly threatens him with dragonfire and insists that he become a better husband to Alyssa. Rogar later fights alongside Jaehaerys against the Vulture King in Dorne.
* His son **Boremund** is a staunch ally of House Targaryen, again fighting the Dornish, but is dismayed when his niece, Rhaenys -- the daughter of his sister Jocelyn Baratheon and Aemon, Prince of Dragonstone -- is not recognized as the heir to the Iron Throne after Aemon's death.
* His son **Borros** declares for the Greens (the Aegon/Hightower side) in the Dance of the Dragons, rather than Rhaenyra's blacks despite King Viserys clearly naming her his heir. Borros seems irate that Rhaenyra's side would just assume they have his support because of their blood ties. His cousin Rhaenys declares for Rhaenyra. Borros dies in the civil war that follows.
*  **Lyonel** (the Laughing Storm) takes the side of Duncan the Tall and Baelor Breakspear in the trial of seven at the Tourney at Ashford; but years later, his daughter is jilted when her betrothed, Prince Duncan, decides to marry Jenny of Oldstones instead. Lyonel rebels, declares himself Storm King, and is ultimately defeated in single combat by Dunk the Lunk. The rift is repaired when his heir, Ormund, marries the youngest daughter of King Aegon V, Rhaelle. 
* **Ormund** becomes Hand of the King to Jaehaerys II, and dies in the War of the Ninepenny Kings in the Stepstones. 
* He is succeeded by his son **Steffon**. It's rumored he will replace Tywin Lannister as Hand of the King , but he instead dies returning from a fruitless mission to Essos to find a bride for crown prince Rhaegar Targaryen. 
* Next is, of course, **Robert**, first of his name (titles titles titles, you know the damn words). He rebels against King Aerys, and with the help of other Lords Paramount, defeats the Targaryen forces, slays Rhaegar at the Trident, and seizes the Iron Throne. 

By my count, that's three Baratheon hands of the king and one almost-hand (if you believe Steffon would have replaced Tywin). It's also at least three rebellions (four if you count Borros choosing the greens instead of the blacks). And it's two marriages to Targaryen brides (Alyssa to Rogar and Rhaelle to Ormund), and one of a Baratheon to the crown prince (Jocelyn-Aemon). There are also the endless Dornish wars which the Baratheons seem to have led on behalf of the Targaryens. House Baratheon is one of House Targaryen's fiercest allies, but also clearly one of their biggest rivals and liabilities. Sometimes, as in cases like Rogar's, both alliance and disloyalty exist in the same person!

This all has me wondering what Stannis would (will?) do if (when?) a legitimate Targaryen heir shows up -- especially if it is not a foreign conqueror like Dany or a pampered prince like fAegon but someone who has earned his grudging respect: Jon Snow. Stannis has seen Jon's leadership in action at the Wall; Jon's advice on allying with the northern mountain clans has proven to be solid advice for Stannis thus far; and we may be about to see Melisandre resurrect Jon (giving him an aura of super-humanness destined for greatness, perhaps) and even possibly switch her allegiance to him if she sees him as a better Azor Ahai candidate. 

Where will this all leave Stannis? He has said he never wanted the crown; he just felt it was his duty. As a young man, was even torn about whether to support his own brother in rebellion or stay loyal to the crown. So would if Jon is revealed as, say, Aemon Targaryen, and Melisandre decides to back him, would Stannis ever consider whether continuing to seek the crown *wasn't* his duty? If there were another candidate with a more legitimate claim--one he respected--would he stand aside, or even swear his sword to that candidate? 

(Or, do you think he will just burn Shireen and/or die a broken man before ever learning Jon's identity or grappling further with succession issues?)

Please, help me out of this quarantine fever dream. I don't know what I think, other than that we're probably not done with this tangled dance of stags and dragons.",asoiaf,Stannis and the Tangled Targ/Baratheon History (Spoilers Extended)

877,"I was just randomly trying to find a bunch of explanations for the long night and for how the Others work, and found a few ideas. I have absolutely nothing to back them up, other than ""it sounds cool"":

* The Others hunt human beings because they've been compelled to by the CotF. As their creation, the Children wanted to ensure humans would leave them the hell alone, and in the spells/ritual that turned that first Andal into who the series calls the Night King, they instructed that the Others would be programmed to hunt down humans. Hence why they go around killing people.
* The Others were ""asleep"", as some characters in the books claim, because the CotF put them to sleep. This other spell is what could have ended the long night in the past, or have been a part this whole Azor Ahai thing, and when the Others were repelled, the spell was put into effect and that's why the Others didn't show up until a few millennia later. The spell weakened or broke because there are less CotF to maintain it, or maybe we can pin it to this theory of ""there must always be a Stark in Winterfell""
* The phrase ""there must always be a Stark in Winterfell"" is the old remnant of a ward placed on Winterfell. Just like the cave where the Children hid, Winterfell had a ward placed there by Bran the Builder, and he attached it to his own bloodline via some kind of blood magic. The phrase itself is a subtle reminder of this ward being effective.
* The seasons are erratic and unstable because of the creation of the Others. The CotF shattered the balance of magic when they created the Others (if they did), and since then the seasons have been unstable.

That's pretty much it. Like I said I have absolutely zero evidence to support any of this, but there is also nothing to prove it wrong (I think?), and it sounds cool and plausible.

889,"GRRM has been quoted as saying:

&gt;Q: How much does a character lose through death?

&gt;**GRRM**: ""Death is hard."" lol.gif The character gets more and more removed from his or her former life. The main thing remaining, what brings Beric back, is the sense of purpose, the mission he has yet to accomplish. - [SSM, US Signing Tour, 18 November 2005](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/US_Signing_Tour_Half_Moon_Bay_CA/)

**In this post, I want to explore the different deaths/resurrections and how the character has changed**

***

**Wights**

Outside of physical appearance, wights become clumsier:

&gt;When he looked down he could see them stumbling through the snow; shapeless things, and clumsy. His boots had been black, he seemed to remember, but the snow had caked around them, and now they were misshapen white balls. Like two clubfeet made of ice. -ASOS, Samwell I

But similar to other characters some remnant does remain and they seem focused on certain things before their death:

&gt;""**Can they talk?"" asked Jon Snow. ""I think not, but I cannot claim to know. Monsters they may be, but they were men before they died. How much remains? The one I slew was intent on killing Lord Commander Mormont. Plainly it remembered who he was and where to find him.**"" Maester Aemon would have grasped his purpose, Jon did not doubt; Sam Tarly would have been terrified, but he would have understood as well. ""My lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. We understand little of the wights and less about the Others. We need to learn."" -ADWD, Jon VIII

If you are interested, I theorized that once Ser Alliser dies, he will [rise as a wight and attempt to kill Jon Snow](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dy3mqt/alliser_thornes_destiny_become_a_wighttry_to_kill/)

***

**Beric Dondarrion**

Beric has [seven](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ezwc1n/the_seven_deaths_of_the_lightning_lord_spoilers/) deaths before finally giving his life Cat. We see how much of himself he loses:

&gt;""**Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?**"" -ASOS, Arya VII

But if we compare this to the original quote by GRRM:

&gt;The main thing remaining, what brings Beric back, is the sense of purpose, the mission he has yet to accomplish.

And Beric's actions:

&gt;Her face, Brienne thought. Her face was so strong and handsome, her skin so smooth and soft. ""Lady Catelyn?"" Tears filled her eyes. ""They said . . . they said that you were dead.""

""She is,"" said Thoros of Myr. ""The Freys slashed her throat from ear to ear. When we found her by the river she was three days dead. Harwin begged me to give her the kiss of life, but it had been too long. **I would not do it, so Lord Beric put his lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from him to her. And . . . she rose. May the Lord of Light protect us. She rose.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII

So Beric either didn't know that he was going to die or his ""purpose"" was to resurrect Lady Stoneheart for some reason.

***

**Lady Stoneheart**

&gt;**""Death and guest right,"" muttered Long Jeyne Heddle. ""They don't mean so much as they used to, neither one.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII

and:

&gt;**""She wants her son alive, or the men who killed him dead,"" said the big man. ""She wants to feed the crows, like they did at the Red Wedding. Freys and Boltons, aye. We'll give her those, as many as she likes. All she asks from you is Jaime Lannister.""** -AFFC, Brienne VIII

But also keep in mind that one of the last things she heard before she died:

&gt;A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to Robb. ""**Jaime Lannister sends his regards.**"" He thrust his longsword through her son's heart, and twisted. -ASOS, Catelyn VII

***

**Coldhands**

Coldhands is different from the wights and more similar to LSH/Beric or even Robert Strong:

&gt;The ranger killed a pig. Coldhands stood beside the door, a raven on his arm, both staring at the fire. **Reflections from the flames glittered off four black eyes**. **He does not eat**, Bran remembered, and he fears the flames. -ADWD, Bran I

Coldhands aids Bloodraven and using this logic his death ""long ago"" should have been in some way aiding Bloodraven or Bran.

***

**Robert Strong**

Robert Strong is most likely Gregor Clegane's reanimated corpse:

&gt;""Tell me, ser, where did this man come from?"" demanded Mace Tyrell. ""**Why have we never heard his name before? He does not speak, he will not show his face, he is never seen without his armor. Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight?**""

&gt;**We do not even know if he's alive. Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food nor drink, and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy. Why should he? Dead men do not shit.** Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who this Ser Robert really was beneath that gleaming white armor. A suspicion that Mace Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared. Whatever the face hidden behind Strong's helm, it must remain hidden for now. The silent giant was his niece's only hope. And pray that he is as formidable as he appears. -ADWD, Epilogue

And since Qyburn has dabbled in necromancy, it may be he has just figured out a way to do the ""blood magic"" required for resurrection (only death can pay for life). But lets say that he does ""remember"" some things. Here are some guesses:

- Ser Loras:

&gt;""After the Hand's tourney, it were, before the war come,"" Chiswyck was saying. ""We were on our ways back west, seven of us with Ser Gregor. Raff was with me, and young Joss Stilwood, he'd squired for Ser in the lists. Well, we come on this pisswater river, running high on account there'd been rains. No way to ford, but there's an alehouse near, so there we repair. Ser rousts the brewer and tells him to keep our horns full till the waters fall, and you should see the man's pig eyes shine at the sight o' silver. So he's fetching us ale, him and his daughter, and poor thin stuff it is, no more'n brown piss, which don't make me any happier, nor Ser neither. And all the time this brewer's saying how glad he is to have us, custom being slow on account o' them rains. The fool won't shut his yap, not him, **though Ser is saying not a word, just brooding on the Knight o' Pansies and that bugger's trick he played.** You can see how tight his mouth sits, so me and the other lads we know better'n to say a squeak to him, but this brewer he's got to talk, he even asks how m'lord fared in the jousting. Ser just gave him this look.""  -ACOK, Arya VII

- Anti Dornish/Targaryen:

&gt;**""Elia of Dorne,"" they all heard Ser Gregor say, when they were close enough to kiss. His deep voice boomed within the helm. ""I killed her screaming whelp."" He thrust his free hand into Oberyn's unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. ""Then I raped her."" Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishman's mouth, making splinters of his teeth. ""Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this."" As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening crunch.** Ellaria Sand wailed in terror, and Tyrion's breakfast came boiling back up. He found himself on his knees retching bacon and sausage and applecakes, and that double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers. -ASOS, Tyrion X

Cleganebowl, etc. are other possibilities as well. 

***

**Jon Snow**

This was one area the show completely failed on (as Jon was pretty much the same guy) and I can't wait to see how GRRM approaches this resurrection (warging Ghost/Shireen's burning/Mel/etc. all should be involved).

And while I have seen it argued well that since he warged ghost, death won't have too profound of an affect on Jon, I think that all the resurrection in the series is basically so Jon's doesn't seem ""cheap"".

There are numerous ways I've seen it theorized he will change, such as becoming more of a ""dragon"", or even becoming [""bitter enemies"" with Bran](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cwqi0b/bran_vs_jon_bitter_enemies_spoilers_extended/).

***

I've seen it argued that several other characters have died/been resurrected as well including Victarion, Maegor the Cruel, Bran and even Daenerys. But with regards to them, the main reason I tend to disagree is that they don't really show any real changes.


***

Like ""only death can pay for life"", and ""all magic has a cost"", death changing a person is a running theme in the series and it seems to show up in each character that has or should be resurrected.

One last shameless self plug if you are interested [Lady Stoneheart and Coldhands had the same character origin](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/edgp0s/cold_hands_and_a_stone_heart_spoilers_extended/)

893,"Some days ago /u/PatrickMcWhorter posted a thread https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/g8sp7z/spoilers_main_warging_mind_control/ . The question was whether any Stark controls the mind of his/her direwolf. Bran no doubt does this. IF others do, they are not aware of the process. I wrote:

&gt; In ASoS Arya XII, not long after the Red Wedding, Arya tries to fall asleep

&gt; ... wondering if she should...rescue Lady Catelyn herself. When she closed her eyes she saw her mother's face against the back of her eyelids. *She's so close I could almost smell her* . . . and then she *could* smell her.

&gt; The italics are George's. When she can smell her is probably the moment she starts warging. She/Nymeria follows the scent, paddles out and with difficulty brings the pale, wrinkled body back to the shore:

&gt; *Rise* she thought. *Rise and eat and run with us.*

So Arya considered rescuing Catelyn herself and did exactly that through warging Nymeria in a dream.  It turns out this is semi-confirmed by the wording Thoros uses in describing Lady Stoneheart's resurrection to Brienne:

&gt; ""And . . . she **rose**. May the Lord of Light protect us. She **rose.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII (bolding is mine)

Same verb, different tense. BTW, Arya's intense involvement with saving her mother's body may point to her later meeting up with Lady Stoneheart and maybe even 'running' with the BWB.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Published) Minor confirmation of mind control in warging
894,"Bloodraven explains to Bran a little about his ability:

&gt;""Once you have mastered your gifts, you may look where you will and see what the trees have seen, be it yesterday or last year or a thousand ages past. Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come. Certain moths live their whole lives in a day, yet to them that little span of time must seem as long as years and decades do to us. An oak may live three hundred years, a redwood tree three thousand. A weirwood will live forever if left undisturbed. To them seasons pass in the flutter of a moth's wing, and past, present, and future are one. Nor will your sight be limited to your godswood. **The singers carved eyes into their heart trees to awaken them, and those are the first eyes a new greenseer learns to use … but in time you will see well beyond the trees themselves.**"" -ADWD, Bran III

A few months ago I posted a list of the [Accessible Weirwoods/Heart Trees](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dwsvf5/accessible_weirwoodheart_trees_spoilers_extended/) that Bran/Bloodraven have access to at this time (even though Bloodraven can see beyond the trees).


**Possible ways in which Bran/Bloodraven can ""influence"" our 13 current POV locations.**

**Slaver's Bay**: Victarion, Barristan, Tyrion

**Dothraki Sea**: Daenerys

***

#Each Location

We currently have 20 POVs across 13 named locations.

**Beyond the Wall**

Probably the easiest for Bloodraven Bran to see, but as we don't have any other POV characters in this location I don't think its super necessary to expand on it too much.

There are numerous locations with weirwoods, they also have Coldhands and his ravens.

**Skaagos**

POV: Davos

Davos is currently at least en route to Skaagos where we know that Shaggy has at least attacked a ""unicorn"" and that we will see more of them in the future.

But Bran can see the events here using one of the numerous weirwoods:

&gt;The Skagosi who reside there are little regarded by the other Northmen, who consider them no better than wildlings and name them Skaggs. The Skagosi call themselves the stoneborn, referring to the fact that Skagos means ""stone"" in the Old Tongue. A huge, hairy, foul-smelling folk (some maesters believe the Skagosi to have a strong admixture of Ibbenese blood; others suggest that they may be descended from giants), clad in skins and furs and untanned hides, and said to ride on unicorns, the Skagosi are the subject of many a dark rumor. **It is claimed that they still offer human sacrifice to their weirwoods**, lure passing ships to destruction with false lights, and feed upon the flesh of men during winter. -TWOIAF, The North: The Stoneborn of Skagos

***

**The Wall**

POVs: Mel and Jon*

There is no actual weirwood at Castle Black, as characters head to a weirwood grove north of the wall to say their vows:

&gt;Mormont himself confirmed Grenn's doubts. ""Castle Black has no need of a godswood. Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea. **You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot**, and mayhap your gods as well."" -AGOT, Jon VI

There are also numerous faces carved into the trees between the Wall and Mole's Town by the wildlings.

***

**The North**

POV: Theon and Asha

Theon and Asha are currently encamped near the Crofter's Village with Stannis and his army.

&gt;Aye,"" said Big Bucket Wull. ""Red Rahloo means nothing here. You will only make the old gods angry. They are watching from their island.""

&gt;The crofter's village stood between two lakes, the larger dotted with small wooded islands that punched up through the ice like the frozen fists of some drowned giant. **From one such island rose a weirwood gnarled and ancient, its bole and branches white as the surrounding snows.** Eight days ago Asha had walked out with Aly Mormont to have a closer look at its slitted red eyes and bloody mouth. It is only sap, she'd told herself, the red sap that flows inside these weirwoods. But her eyes were unconvinced; seeing was believing, and what they saw was frozen blood.

&gt;""You northmen brought these snows upon us,"" insisted Corliss Penny. ""You and your demon trees. R'hllor will save us."" -ADWD, The Sacrifice

This plotline is probably one of the most likely that Bran could get involved in as we see it possibly happening:

&gt;**""Then do the deed yourself, Your Grace."" The chill in Asha's voice made Theon shiver in his chains. ""Take him out across the lake to the islet where the weirwood grows, and strike his head off with that sorcerous sword you bear. That is how Eddard Stark would have done it. Theon slew Lord Eddard's sons. Give him to Lord Eddard's gods. The old gods of the north. Give him to the tree.""** 

&gt;And suddenly there came a wild thumping, as the maester's ravens hopped and flapped inside their cages, their black feathers flying as they beat against the bars with loud and raucous caws. ""The tree,"" one squawked, ""the tree, the tree,"" whilst the second screamed only, ""Theon, Theon, Theon.""-TWOW, Theon I

***

**The Riverlands**

POV: Jaime, Brienne

It is unknown just where exactly Lady Stoneheart is located in the riverlands, but it there are weirwoods in several different castles (Riverrun for Red Wedding, dead weirwood at Raventree Hall)

But if Lady Stoneheart is currently hold Pod/Hyle at Hollow Hill (where Beric fought the Hound):

&gt;""When we left King's Landing we were men of Winterfell and men of Darry and men of Blackhaven, Mallery men and Wylde men. We were knights and squires and men-at-arms, lords and commoners, bound together only by our purpose."" **The voice came from the man seated amongst the weirwood roots halfway up the wall.** ""Six score of us set out to bring the king's justice to your brother."" The speaker was descending the tangle of steps toward the floor. ""Six score brave men and true, led by a fool in a starry cloak."" A scarecrow of a man, he wore a ragged black cloak speckled with stars and an iron breastplate dinted by a hundred battles. A thicket of red-gold hair hid most of his face, save for a bald spot above his left ear where his head had been smashed in. ""More than eighty of our company are dead now, but others have taken up the swords that fell from their hands."" When he reached the floor, the outlaws moved aside to let him pass. One of his eyes was gone, Arya saw, the flesh about the socket scarred and puckered, and he had a dark black ring all around his neck. ""With their help, we fight on as best we can, for Robert and the realm."" -ASOS, Arya VI

***

**The Vale**

POV: Sansa

I am unsure how much longer Sansa's plotline will remain in the Vale, but the Eyrie (which Alayne has left) does not have a weirwood/heart tree:

&gt;But who could she pray to? The garden had been meant for a godswood once, she knew, but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root. A godswood without gods, as empty as me. -ASOS, Sansa VII 

&gt;Even the gods were silent. The Eyrie boasted a sept, but no septon; a godswood, but no heart tree. No prayers are answered here, she often thought, though some days she felt so lonely she had to try. Only the wind answered her, sighing endlessly around the seven slim white towers and rattling the Moon Door every time it gusted. It will be even worse in winter, she knew. In winter this will be a cold white prison. -AFFC, Alayne II

There is a weirwood throne and door.

***

**Oldtown**

POV: Sam and Aeron

There is a weirwood at the Citadel. It should be noted that the black ravens and the white ravens (trained/bred/etc. by the citadel) hate each other.

&gt;It was cool and dim inside the castle walls. **An ancient weirwood filled the yard, as it had since these stones had first been raised**. The carved face on its trunk was grown over by the same purple moss that hung heavy from the tree's pale limbs. Half of the branches seemed dead, but elsewhere a few red leaves still rustled, and it was there the ravens liked to perch. The tree was full of them, and there were more in the arched windows overhead, all around the yard. The ground was speckled by their droppings. As they crossed the yard, one flapped overhead and he heard the others quorking to each other. ""Archmaester Walgrave has his chambers in the west tower, below the white rookery,"" Alleras told him. ""The white ravens and the black ones quarrel like Dornishmen and Marchers, so they keep them apart."" -AFFC, Samwell V

Please keep in mind that characters will move and get closer/further from these weirwoods, and like Bloodraven tells Bran, at some point he won't need the trees anymore (possibly referring to using ravens, etc.) 

***

**Dorne**

POV: Areo Hotah

Areo Hotah is currently en route to High Hermitage with Obara Sand and Balon Swann as they chase Darkstar.

Most of the weirwoods in Dorne were cut down:

&gt;What does seem to be accurate from all the tales, however, is that the First Men soon came to war with the children of the forest. Unlike the children, the First Men farmed the land and raised up ringforts and villages. **And in so doing, they took to chopping down the weirwood trees, including those with carved faces**, and for this, the children attacked them, leading to hundreds of years of war. The First Men—who had brought with them strange gods, horses, cattle, and weapons of bronze—were also larger and stronger than the children, and so they were a significant threat. -TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Coming of the First Men

That said, High Hermitage is the seat of House Dayne. And since House Dayne can trace their lineage back to the First Men, it is possible (but unconfirmed) a weirwood could remain at High Hermitage.

***

**Stormlands**

POV: Arianne and Jon Connington 

There was a heart tree at Storm's End, but Stannis burned it.

That said the Weirwood Alliance took place in the Stormlands (and I of the belief that the Howling Hill is the same cave in TWOW, Arianne II):

&gt;The Andals established themselves on Cape Wrath as well and might well have taken all the rainwood if they had not proved as willing to make war on one another as upon the kingdoms of the First Men. But King Baldric I Durrandon (the Cunning) proved expert at setting them one against the other, and King Durran XXI took the unprecedented step of seeking out the remaining children of the forest in the caves and hollow hills where they had taken refuge and making common cause with them against the men from beyond the sea. In the battles fought at Black Bog, in the Misty Wood, and **beneath the Howling Hill (the precise location of which has sadly been lost), this Weirwood Alliance dealt the Andals a series of stinging defeats** and checked the decline of the Storm Kings for a time. An even more unlikely alliance, between King Cleoden I and three Dornish kings, won an even more telling victory over Drox the CorpseMaker on the river Slayne near Stonehelm a generation later. -TWOIAF, The Stormlands: Andals in the Stormlands

***

**King's Landing**

POV: Cersei

There is a godswood in the Red Keep (this is where Ned meets Cersei).

My favorite thing about the below quote is just how wrong Ser Dontos is:

&gt;Ser Dontos glanced about anxiously. ""The risk is too great. Y**ou must come here, to the godswood. As often as you can. This is the safest place. The only safe place. Nowhere else. Not in your chambers nor mine nor on the steps nor in the yard, even if it seems we are alone. The stones have ears in the Red Keep, and only here may we talk freely.**"" -ACOK, Sansa II

**Braavos**

POV: Arya

&gt;They are not my Seven. They were my mother's gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the Twins. **She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart**. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the pack survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the pack had been taken and slain and skinned. -AFFC, Arya I

The House of Black and White does have a partial weirwood door and weirwood seats:

&gt;At the top she found a set of carved wooden doors twelve feet high. **The left-hand door was made of weirwood pale as bone, the right of gleaming ebony. In their center was a carved moon face; ebony on the weirwood side, weirwood on the ebony. The look of it reminded her somehow of the heart tree in the godswood at Winterfell. The doors are watching me, she thought.** She pushed upon both doors at once with the flat of her gloved hands, but neither one would budge. Locked and barred. ""Let me in, you stupid,"" she said. ""I crossed the narrow sea."" She made a fist and pounded. ""Jaqen told me to come. I have the iron coin."" She pulled it from her pouch and held it up. ""See? Valar morghulis."" -AFFC, Arya I

Outside of the pieces from cyvasse, I can't find any sort of of weirwood/heart tree reference in slaver's bay. Which makes sense as the ""magic"" from the two continents rarely overlaps.

Similar to Slaver's Bay there is not mention of of weirwood/heart trees while Dany is out in the Dothraki Sea. Its possible one could exist in Vaes Dothrak.

895,"I haven't been following this sub for very long, so forgive me if it's been brought up before. I've tried to search for discussion on this issue, though, and haven't found much, so here we goes.

# I believe Davos Seaworth died during the Battle of Blackwater Bay but was brought back to life by the Merling King.

In order to defend this, we have to discuss the how and the why. The how seems the most straightforward part, so we'll start with that, and then we'll delve into the why.

# How did Davos die?

First off, there's this foreshadowing, from the second paragraph in Davos I from ASOS: 

&gt;Once he drank seawater, **the end would come swiftly**, he knew...

This is our hint - drinking seawater (or drowning in it) portends death. Given that, let's examine what happens in his flashback to the Battle of Blackwater later in the chapter: 

&gt;Davos swam past them, kicking with all the strength left in his legs, giving himself up to the current, the water filling his eyes. **Deeper he went, and deeper, and deeper still**. With every stroke it grew harder to hold his breath. He remembered seeing the bottom, soft and dim, as a stream of bubbles burst from his lips. Something touched his leg... a snag or a fish or a drowning man, he could not tell.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;When he opened his mouth to scream, **the water came rushing in**, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew that he was drowning.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next he knew the sun was up, and he lay upon a stony strand beneath a spire of naked stone, with the empty bay all around and a broken mast, a burned sail, and a swollen corpse beside him. The mast, the sail, and the dead man vanished with the next high tide, leaving Davos alone on his rock amidst the spears of the merling king.

Now we're meant to assume that Davos regains consciousness once he washes up on the spears. But look at this passage from the same chapter:

&gt;Or perhaps he would simply walk into the water one day, and strike out for the shore that he knew lay somewhere to the north, beyond his sight.

I think it's fair to assume that if Davos thought any land was closer, he would aim for that. But since he couldn't see the shore, that means the spears of the merling king were *many miles* away from land, and Davos somehow drifted there, in treacherous waters, after probably breathing in water during his deep dive.

So the obvious conclusion is that he drowned. But then what? How did he get to his spear alive? Remember, the other two castaways were a corpse and a wrecked ship, implying that even if you made it there, you didn't survive the passage.

Note that ""something touched his leg,"" but he didn't see what it was. That touch was a *merling that was near the battle.* The merling would then have been able to bring his body to the attention of the merling king for resurrection, who would have then deposited his now-living self onto one of his spears.

# But why?

This is the more difficult and meatier question of the two. Why would the merling king bother with raising Davos? The most straightforward answer is because the merling king is backing Stannis and wants Davos there for support. But why would the merling king care?

Well let's think about Davos' impact. 

\- He is named Hand of the King.

\- He prevents Stannis from killing Edric Storm.

\- He convinced Stannis to go north to the wall, which brought Melisandre to Jon Snow (to probably eventually resurrect him) and set Stannis against what is probably the true enemy.

\- He treated with the Manderlys. Of note is that Marlon Manderly's helm is in the shape of the merling king, and the Manderlys end up pledging allegiance to Stannis provided they can return Rickon from Skagos. This doesn't provide cause but does provide a metaphor for underlying alliance.

So I think it's reasonable that the Merling king feels Davos will further the Merling king's goals through Stannis. But what are those goals? The only reasonable conclusion would be that the Others represent an existential threat to the merlings.

But the merlings are underwater, you might say! Yes, and the Others don't appear to have amphibious capabilities, but there are clearly corpses down there. Many corpses, of dead humans slain in shipwrecks and war. If the Others can raise all manner of beasts - likely from a distance as with the wight that gave Jon Snow his blackened hand - there's no reason to think they couldn't do the same thing with drowned corpses, both human and merling. And the merlings would be *screwed*. Why? Because wights die from fire and last I checked, flaming swords weren't an option below the waves.

So the merling king would want the problem of the Others taken care of on land, but he has to know that the landlubbers would be too busy fighting each other. So he needs someone to go and warn them. Someone like...

Patchface.

Remember, Patchface died under similar catastrophic circumstances, only to wash up ashore several days later. According to the fisherfolk, ""a mermaid had taught him to breathe water in exchange for his seed."" That's two characters that could have been resurrected after dealing with merlings, but obviously there are very significant differences. Patchface is resurrection version 1 - the merling king tries to send a messenger to Stannis, who he sees as the key. But raising humans isn't so easy. Though he appears to have a more direct link to Gods and prophecy, Patchface's mind was utterly broken. The merling king must realize he's useless, so he needed another champion. This time he chose Davos, who was already close to Stannis, and saved him. By putting his pawn back on the board, so to speak, he was able to send Stannis north to the wall where Stannis needed to be.

# Got anything else?

I just want you to take a minute to consider the name. 

Davos Seaworth.

""Seaworth"" means... ""his purpose comes from the sea."" In other words, the merling king has chosen him to play a role, used Davos for his purpose.

Yeah, but what about Davos? Well, Davos comes form the Romansch word ""tauvus"", which means ""behind."" So, this likely refers to him being ""behind"" Stannis, or ""backing"" Stannis.

But also of note is that the Swedish city of Davos is the home of the World Economic Forum, which is a group ""committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas"" This sounds like the role Davos has been playing with Stannis as he's travelled around Westeros, attempting to unify various peoples to Stannis' cause. At no point, of note, does Davos suggest fighting against any other people. He's trying to convince Stannis to unite others, to save people, to protect the weak and join causes supporting life, not advocating for death.

# So what does it all mean?

I know there are a lot of Stannis fans here, but this does not mean that Stannis is either Azor Ahai or the future king. But he clearly has a pivotal role to play if two separate Gods (R'Hllor and The Merling King) both send emissaries to guide you toward that war. Whether that role is as a future king or simply to be the general that runs the campaign, we'll see. But Davos was sent to guide Stannis there, and guide him he did.",asoiaf,"Davos died in the Battle of Blackwater, and all that that implies. (Spoilers extended)"
897,"I’m currently re-reading ACOK Tyrion VIII (gotta keep up with the NotACast!) and this struck my “What if?” nerve:

After deciding that a deal must be made with the Tyrells to marry Margaery and Joffrey, Cersei and Tyrion argue over who should go. A few names are thrown out before they each recommend the other go, and then Littlefinger offers to go himself.

&gt;Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish, nor did he want the man out of his sight, yet what other choice was left him? **It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself, and he knew full well that if he left King’s Landing for any length of time, all that he managed to accomplish would be undone.**

So, what do you guys think happens if Tyrion goes in place of Littlefinger? We know that, despite Tyrion not trusting him, Petyr does actually make a working marriage pact that allies the Tyrells with the Lannisters (and saves King’s Landing at the Battles of the Blackwater).

If Tyrion goes, is the deal still successful? Do Tyrell forces still aide Tywin’s strike during the Battle of the Blackwater? Does the city fall quickly during the battle because Cersei stops production on the chain and training wildfire pitchers in Tyrion’s absence?

900,"... die in Drogo's pyre? I read [this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gd0nq6/if_stannis_wins_the_battle_of_ice_he_will_have/fpf3b3p) where u/yvael_tercero theorized that, after his resurrection, the wildlings will look upon Jon as a God on Earth. And I thought this will be cool when he meets Dany, who a similar divine savior thing going with the people who saw her come out of the fire. But did she actually die in the fire? She came out unscathed  other than her hair, where LSH and Lord Beric still bear the wounds from their deaths. The obvious answer is that her particularly magical Targaryens skin protected her from the flames. 

But would that have protected her from death as well? She was in there long enough for the wood to turn to ash- she would have asphyxiated. So if we accept that she died, has she been expiriencing the reinforced, hyperfocused sense of duty that we can see in Lord Beric and Lady Stoneheart? There are theories that this will happen to Jon as well. And what if her flying away on Drogon is another sort of rebirth for her? Many people think she miscarried afterwards, I think she's having her first period since her son died, but there's no doubt she'll be a different woman when she returns to Mereen. Perhaps this difference will be an additional doubling-down of her sense of duty- abandoning (burning?) Mereen to assume her rightful place on the iron throne.",asoiaf,Did Daenerys...

903,"I've noticed that a lot of people believe if Rhaegar won there would be stability and no more wars, unlike the War of the Five Kings, and he could easily send Elia away or have two wives. I actually believe Robert had the chance of a far more stable reign (which would have been even more stable if he had married a Tyrell or Hightower and punished Clegane), because his only true issue was the Reach &amp; Dorne (Crownlands are't powerful enough to be much of an issue, and are right there so hard to get away with plotting). The other Targ loyalists houses could be swayed and were outnumbered by Baratheon loyalists. Even having married Cersei and letting Clegane go, with all his whoring and drinking, I think the rule would have been more stable if Joff was actually Robert's. The reason is because of these following issues for Rhaegar, and I'm curious how he could overcome them. Do you all have any ideas?  

1) The Faith. The Faith called Maegor's second wife a whore, and Rhaegar has no dragons. Even if they aren't particularly powerful, six out of the seven worship the Seven and follow the Faith's teaching. The Faith and people were already uncomfortable with Targ incest, would insisting on polygamy not be a bridge too far? Not to mention Elia had provided a male heir and a daughter, and Rhaegar had a back up male heir in Viserys so her fertility isn't a solid argument—especially when Rhaella only had one male heir in 16 years. Plus, other Lords may worry their daughters will be put away if they only have one son and one daughter if Rhaegar can do it.  Lyanna not worshipping the Faith would also be a factor. 

 The obvious solution is to not push for Lyanna as a second wife, or an annulment. Then again, that potentially angers the North...

2) The Stormlands and Dorne. Dorne prides themselves on having never bent the knee, and having come in on marriage. They also have the ability to be independent and have spent more time as an independent nation than part of Westeros. Elia probably had Dornish attendants who were also held hostage. If he annuls his marriage to Elia &amp; holds her &amp; a few of her attendants hostage, it might not be enough to keep Dorne from shutting the Prince's Pass &amp; the Boneway no matter how much Doran and Oberyn love their sister. If you combine that with the fact that he was in Dorne for most of the war, it would be spitting in the Martell's face too much—they would have to do something major, or be seen as weak by their bannermen. Thousands of Dornishmen died for a war &amp; these are the same people who would rather burn than submit in the past....

The Stormlands are sworn to the Targs, but acknowledging Lyanna as a Queen might be very hard for them...the Baratheons were well loved. Again, if Rhaegar legitimized Jon and gave him Summerhall—in the Stormlands—the Baratheons would be seen as ""weak"" by their bannermen and might react badly. 

3) The North/Stormlands/Tully/Vale bloc. Jon lost Elbert and Denys Arryn, the Riverlands lost heirs, the Northerners lost heirs, etc. Not to mention the loss of Rickard and Brandon. Yes, there are Vale/Northern/Riverland ties but I doubt they are going to neatly become Rhaegar supporters if he wins based on Lyanna willingly being with him. Aerys still committed grave atrocities, and they'd want him dead. Robert was also well liked, and loved by Jon Arryn. If anything, I'm not sure they would even be happy with Ned—the rape was a large portion of why the war started, even Barristan goes ""their love cost thousands."" Would the other Northerners, who lost their sons and husbands and brothers, be happy if Ned got to continue living at Winterfell while their sons were sent to the wall or punished for being rebels &amp; if they found out Lyanna was a large part of why the war began? Or would that cause conflict....

TLDR: Much of the Northern/Stormlands/Tully/Vale bloc would still be angry—for multiple reasons—with the Targs &amp; it would be hard for Rhaegar to control them...and it could result in another bloody war

4) The Lannisters could help quash potential uprisings, but what's in it for Tywin? His wife was likely raped or at the very least badly sexually harassed  (and unless Rhaegar becomes a kinslayer, Aerys will probably never be punished for it) &amp; his daughter was badly spurned. His son was taken as a Kingsguard and he was left with his hated son, Tyrion. The only possible ""reward"" that Tywin might consider is if any possible niece of his, or a potential daughter of his, was married to Aegon....but the Targs can't afford to piss of the Reach which loyally fought for them &amp; have the largest army. So what keeps Tywin from just sitting in the Westerlands while small scale rebellions break out? Especially when he could a) arrange for Cersei to marry Stannis or even Renly and join the Vale/Riverlands/Stormlands/Northern bloc and stage yet another war or b) go the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" and make a deal with Dorne to ""off"" Rhaegar so it appears he dies in an accident if he gets to be regent",asoiaf,[Spoilers Main] If Rhaegar won

907,"Something I thought of recently is how in the last 2 books the story has mostly followed the point of views of 3 characters each: Cersei, Jaime and Brienne in AFFC; Jon, Dany and Tyrion in ADWD.

In TWOW I feel like it would make sense that, since the story will focus on the Others and winter, the Stark kids finally come to the front and the characters with the most chapters will be Sansa, Arya and Bran. Specially since the 3 of them are each in their own secluded story at the moment, their journey is going to take major strides and bring them to vastly different places than where the book starts and have them take larger roles within the overall story and set them up for the grand finale in ADOS.

Patchface is  resurrection version 1 - the merling king tries to send a messenger to  Stannis, who he sees as the key. So he chose a human of extraordinary  intellect and wit that fell into his hands. But even a highly  intelligent human is still no match for the intellect of a God. So  although Patchface appears to have a more direct link to Gods and  prophecy, his mind was utterly broken by it. The Merling King must have  realized he's useless, so he needed another champion, one that didn't  need a direct mental link to a God. This time he chose Davos, who was  already close to Stannis, and saved him. By putting his pawn back on the  board, so to speak, he was able to ensure Stannis go north to the wall  where Stannis needed to be, without needing to send a direct message  though a mind incapable of handling the thoughts of a God.

Got anything else?

I just want you to take a minute to consider the name.

Davos Seaworth.

""Seaworth""  means... ""his purpose comes from the sea."" In other words, the Merling  King has chosen him to play a role, used Davos for his purpose.

Yeah,  but what about Davos? Well, Davos comes form the Romansch word  ""tauvus"", which means ""behind."" So, this likely refers to him being  ""behind"" Stannis, or ""backing"" Stannis.

913,"Thinking ahead to Stannis potentially defeating the Boltons, and Littlefinger/Sansa possibly coming up to Winterfell later in book 6 or early book 7.

Or he's going to fake his death, try to lure Roose/Ramsay into thinking he's down for the count (pink letter wink wink) and take advantage of that. Regardless. 

Anyway just wondering if this seems likely to people who follow the books more closely than I do. Because it seems plausible that Stannis will be in a position of trying to back one claimant for Winterfell, while Littlefinger is obviously interested in Sansa's influence being extended there.

Ned agreed to raise Jon as his bastard son to protect him, knowing that Robert would kill Jon if he knew about his Targaryen parentage, yada yada yada.

But something was bothering me earlier: did Ned have any way of knowing which parent Jon would more closely resemble, and, if not, what exactly was his plan in the event that Jon took more after his father? If Jon inherited silver-blond hair and/or purple eyes, that can't just be explained as a weird quirk, and it would certainly make Robert suspicious. (I guess purple eyes would further point towards Ashara Dayne being the mother, but again, I doubt Bobby B would accept that without question.) You could make the argument that blond hair could maybe be dyed to disguise it, but at some point, *that* would lead to an awkward conversation with Jon about why (a) his hair was such a weird color, and (b) why that was such a big secret.

925,"Ok, my theory goes like this. At the end of Winds (Or the beggining of Dream), there will be a battle in the Narrow Sea, near Dragonstone, between Stannis and Dany. The basis is this vision at the House of the Undying:

""Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.""

I think we all can agree that the blue-eyed king is Stannis Baratheon. After the vision, Dany is called ""Slayer of lies"", so this must prove that Dany must show that Stannis is not Azor Ahai. So, they must encounter at some time. This proves that the Pink Letter is fake, Stannis is alive and must fight Daenerys. What I think is going to happen is that Stannis will win the North, make Rickon Warden of the North and use Manderly's fleet to fight Dany, who will be coming to Westeros. He will receive the news that Dany is marching to Westeros. But what about Dany? I think Victarion will join her and Dany will return with the Ironfleet. The plot that Theon and Yara had in season 6 of the HBO series will be taken by Vic in Winds, he will give the Iron Fleet to Dany amd will go with the unsullied, the Khalasar and other armies to Westeros, and encounter Stannis in the Narrow Sea, giving a big battle at the end of Winds. Daenerys will prove that Stannis is not AAR and he will be defeated, alongside with the Manderly fleet, all destroyed by Dragonfire. Maybe Stannis will survive and will be condemned to wear the black, where he may die fighting the others. Or maybe he will die by the dragonfire, making and ironic situation, the ""champion"" of the Lord of Light being killed by fire. To make things worse, maybe when Stannis is in the south Jon Snow resurrected will take the Winterfell Throne and crown hinself King in the North, thanks to Robb's will, and Stannis would have losed everything, as the doomed tragic character he is.

One of the first well thought out theories I read was that Stannis was going to become the Night's King 2.0. And while I no longer believe this, I think that there are still numerous ties between Stannis and the character.

In the past I have pointed out similarities between other character and the Night's King:

[Bloodraven](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/czrdy0/bloodraven_vs_the_nights_king_a_comparison/)

[Craster](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/eupa1x/parallels_the_nights_kingcrasters_actions/)

So while I don't think we are going to see another Night's King (in addition to Stannis, Bloodraven and Craster, I've also see Jon/Bran/Roose theorized), I do think that GRRM has intentionally created some parallels between the above characters and the legendary Night's King.

**In this post I would like to point out some similarities between Daemon Targaryen and the Night's King, as well as a few other notes**

***

&gt;**Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains**. -The Rogue Prince

#Martial Ability

**Daemon**

&gt;But the great upheaval of the Dance of the Dragons had its roots in Viserys's reign, and it was chiefly due to the blood royals. In the early part of his reign, Viserys I's chief annoyance was his own brother, Prince Daemon Targaryen. **Daemon was mercurial and quick to take offense, but he was dashing, daring, and dangerous. He was knighted at six-and-ten, like Maegor I, and Jaehaerys I himself gave Daemon the Valyrian steel blade Dark Sister for his prowess**. He had been among the brashest of Viserys's supporters prior to the Great Council and had even gathered a small army of sworn swords and men-at-arms when rumors claimed that Corlys Velaryon was readying a fleet to defend the rights of his son, Laenor. King Jaehaerys avoided bloodshed, but many remembered that Daemon had been ready to come to blows over the matter.

**The Night's King**

&gt;**a warrior who knew no fear.** ""And that was the fault in him,"" she would add, ""for all men must know fear."" -ASOS, Bran IV

#Love Life

**Daemon**

&gt;Prince Daemon improved the armaments and training of the watch and gave them the golden cloaks that led them to be known as the ""gold cloaks"" to this day. He often joined his men in patrolling the city, swiftly becoming known to both the meanest urchin and the wealthiest tradesman, and earned a certain dark reputation in the stews and brothels where he was wont to make free of the wares on offer. Crime fell sharply, though some said it was because Daemon delighted in meting out harsh punishments. Yet those who benefited from his rule loved him well, and Daemon soon became known as ""Lord Flea Bottom."" Later still, after Viserys refused him the title of Prince of Dragonstone, he came to be called ""the Prince of the City."" It was in the brothels of the city that he found a favorite, a paramour—**a very pale Lysene dancer named Mysaria, whose looks and reputation led the prostitutes who knew her to call her Misery, the White Worm**. Later, she became Daemon's mistress of whisperers. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Viserys I

**The Night's King**

&gt;A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, **with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars**. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.

&gt;He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. -ASOS, Bran IV

***

#Thirteen

This one is somewhat of a stretch (as Bloodraven and the Night's King both actually led the NW for 13 years) but:

**Daemon**

&gt;No banners flew above the blackened towers and ruined keeps of Harrenhal when Prince Daemon descended from the sky to take up the castle for his own. A few squatters had found shelter in the castle’s deep vaults and undercellars, but the sound of Caraxes’s wings sent them fleeing. When the last of them was gone, Daemon Targaryen walked the cavernous halls of Harren’s seat alone, with no companion but his dragon. **Each night at dusk he slashed the heart tree in the godswood to mark the passing of another day. Thirteen marks can be seen upon that weirwood still; old wounds, deep and dark, yet the lords who have ruled Harrenhal since Daemon’s day say they bleed afresh every spring**. -The Princess and the Queen

**The Night's King**

&gt;**He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden**. -ASOS, Bran IV

and:

&gt;Yet over the thousands of years of its existence as the chief seat of the Watch, the Nightfort has accrued many legends of its own, some of which have been recounted in Archmaester Harmune's Watchers on the Wall. The oldest of these tales concern the legendary Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who was alleged to have bedded a sorceress pale as a corpse and declared himself a king. **For thirteen years the Night's King and his ""corpse queen"" ruled together,** before King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker, (in alliance, it is said, with the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun) brought them down. Thereafter, he obliterated the Night's King's very name from memory.

&gt;In the Citadel, the archmaesters largely dismiss these tales—though some allow that there may have been a Lord Commander who attempted to carve out a kingdom for himself in the earliest days of the Watch. Some suggest that perhaps the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves. The Night's King has been said to have been variously a Bolton, a Woodfoot, an Umber, a Flint, a Norrey, or even a Stark, depending on where the tale is told. Like all tales, it takes on the attributes that make it most appealing to those who tell it. -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Night's Watch

#Queen

This line about the Night's King has always stood out to me:

&gt;He brought her back to the Nightfort and **proclaimed her a queen and himself her king**, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will

It can be read in a way that insinuates that **the ""Queen"" is the true power and he is just ""her king"".**

And while this thought can be applied to other characters associated with the Night's King, I am only going to do Daemon since this post is supposed to be about him:

&gt;Make no mistake, should Rhaenyra ever sit the Iron Throne, it will be Daemon who rules us, a king consort as cruel and unforgiving as Maegor ever was. -The Princess and the Queen

#""Disappearance""

**Daemon**

&gt;**That Prince Daemon died as well we cannot doubt. His remains were never found, but there are queer currents in that lake, and hungry fish as well. The singers tell us that the old prince survived the fall and afterward made his way back to the girl Nettles, to spend the remainder of his days at her side.** Such stories make for charming songs, but poor history. -The Princess and the Queen


**The Night's King**

&gt;**After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden**. -ASOS, Bran IV

***

This quote is about Misery/Bloodraven, so I didn't think it fit anywhere in the post, but I chose to add it for a little more context/parallel

&gt;**Bloodraven proved to be a capable Hand, but also a master of whisperers who rivaled Lady Misery, and there were those who thought he and his half sister and paramour, Shiera Seastar, used sorcery to ferret out secrets. It became common to refer to his ""thousand eyes and one,"" and men both high and low began to distrust their neighbor for fear of their being a spy in Bloodraven's employ**. Yet Aerys had need of spies, given the trouble that followed the Great Spring Sickness. Summer came, and with it a drought that lasted more than two years. Many blamed the king, and many more accused Bloodraven. There were poor brothers who preached treason, and knights and lords as well. And amongst those were some who whispered a specific treason: that the Black Dragon must return from across the narrow sea and take his rightful place. -The Targaryen Kings: Aerys I

I want to reiterate that I don't think any of the characters I have mentioned are in fact the Night's King. I just love how GRRM weaves parallels to legendary characters (such as the NK) into the current/recent cast.

**TLDR: Some more parallels between the NK and a past character, as well as a few thoughts on the Night's King**",asoiaf,"Another ""parallel"" to the Night's King (Spoilers Extended)"
940,"Common sense states:

&gt;“No two characters in a work of fiction should share the same first name, or even similar-sounding names.” 

Although some notable exceptions exist (*One Hundred Years of Solitude*, anyone?), it’s hardly surprising that almost every fiction author follows this unspoken agreement.
**But not GRRM.** Not in Asoiaf, at least.  **There are four reasons for that:**

* 1 Practical reasons

If u/Mynotoar’s [counting](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2g3p7s/spoilers_all_ive_listed_and_counted_every/) is correct, there’s 2127 characters just within the main five books.
Do you really expect GRRM to give each of them an original name?! 

I guess he could, but… 

* 2 ...ultimately, the good combinations of letters are limited

Especially since GRRM likes to group similar names into categories (example: names from Targaryen/Lannister/Greyjoy share similarities), which is not a surprise given how big the entire asoiaf cast is.

Example: the “ae” + ""ys"" groups you often find in Targaryen names has a limited number of interactions.  Soon or later, some names are bound to overlap.

* 3 Verisimilitude criteria

Although is an oversimplified way, asoiaf aims for parallels with the irl Middle Ages: when England had 8 kings named Henry and the Catholic Church had 23 Popes named John… well, you simply can’t have a series featuring entire dynasties of Kings without ever sharing a name or two. It would be too farfetched.

Because once you start breaking the rule, you can use the repetition of the same names  **4 to highlight some little details**.

---

---

## I mean, if you look at the names you can see that…


**1 Thanks to Walder Frey we can actually track all the shifts in power in Westeros!**

Notice how the Frey's naming system starts from Targaryen, then becomes Baratheon and then Lannister.
We can even see when Littlefinger did actually become Master of Coin!

**Walder's naming is also a good moral barometer**, because we never see any Eddard or Stannis Frey, because Walder  knew these two characters couldn’t be swayed by some naming.

On the contrary, House Dayne naming someone Eddard *(House Dayne, of all the people!)* means a lot about Ned Stark moral stature.

---

**2 Stannis Seaworth**

Nobody names his son Stannis except for Davos.

But we know  Davos wasn’t trying to impress his king for two reasons:

-The siege of Storm's End is over in 283. But since there's no way that Devan Seaworth is more than 18 years old during ADWD, this means that Stannis Seaworth, younger than Devan, was born way after Stannis knighted our Onion friend.

Another proof is that Stannis Seaworth is... the seventh son: had Davos wanted to be a lickspittle, he would have done way earlier.

---

**3 Random curiosities**

-The group “Ty” is for Lannister names, “ae” for Targaryen, “On” for Greyjoys.
Generally speaking, names starting with “Q” are mostly Ironborn.

-The most common name, if we count both male and female counterpart, it's Jon/Jeyne.

-Although popular, I suspect  we don't see ""Pate"" that much because it's a commonfolk name rather than a nobiliar one.

-Alys becomes more popular if we include its variations Alysa and Alysanne.

-Most repeated name in a single House? ""Aegon Targaryen"", ""Walder Frey"" and ""Brandon Stark"".

-In Meereen the most popular one is Grazdan. &gt;!Or... Harzoo &gt;_&gt;!&lt;

-The name with more variations is Raymund/Raymond/Raymun/Ryman/Rymolf/Rymond/Rymund.

-I can count at least one name missing from the name counting above: Violet is missing!
Do you recall who Violet is/was, without looking at the books?

942,"There are some characters who might potentially play a bigger role in the future. There's a lot of speculation about which characters those might be and what will be their role. One of the more popular subjects of these discussions is Satin, Jon's steward at the Wall after Edd Tollett is sent away.


**What do we know for sure about Satin?**

Satin is a young man who's about 18 or 19 at the end of ADWD. He has curly black hair and brown eyes. His features are soft and presumably feminine. He has a beard (which is important in case someone suggest he's actually a woman). There's no mention of his built, so it's probably nothing unusual (he's not extremely skinny, fat, tall or short or a muscular beast like, say, Robert). He's flamboyant and cares about his appearance. He uses perfume. Probably attractive. He has graceful moves.

He seems friendly (judging by his interactions with Jon, Alys and the guys from Jon's friend group), but that's probably all that we can say about his attributes. He also seems quite brave (despite being frightened to the point of peeing himself during the Battle in Castle Black, he never bitches or tries to flee or hide, but fights alongside Jon).

He doesn't have a lot of friends at the Wall. Him and Jon seem to be allies (even friends, but definitely not as close as Jon is with his group of old friends - Sam, Edd, Grenn, Pyp...) and Jon vouches for him more than once.

He was hanging out with Jon's friends at at least one occasion in ADWD (when they were mocking Mel).

He seems to be strongly disliked by the ""conservative wing"" on The Wall including Bowen Marsh and Queen's men.

He doesn't seem to be competent in combat. Maybe he's faking but given that he's been fighting for his life at one point, I'm doubtful.


**Satin's claimed origin**

Satin claims to be from Old Town where he was born and raised as a whore. Presumably he left at some point, went to the Vale, got captured for a reason we don't yet know, ended up in ""lord's dungeon"" and agreed to take the black.


**Satin and the show that shall not be named**

Obviously, Satin is one of the characters that didn't make it on screen. That doesn't say anything about his importance to the narrative though - there are characters that are undoubtedly important and didn't make the cut as well. Instead of Satin, we got Olly kind of taking on his role. I don't know if we can take Olly's actions and fate as anything to go by, but for the sake of it, let's mention that Olly played an infamous role in Jon's assasination plot. Satin doesn't have any apparent motive to take part in that plot (other than if he felt 'betrayed' by Jon's actions, but he never voiced his concerns or acted shady about it) and Jon's killers seem to hate him. Jon also doesn't notice Satin before he dies. So I'd say while it's highly unlikely that Satin might be following Olly's footprints, it's not completely impossible.


**The 'mysterious' side of Satin**

So, Satin seems like an all-around solid secondary, or even tertiary character. But is there more to him than meets the eye? Let's take a look at some of the things that might imply that there might be:


*1. Old Town, Gulltown. What's the difference?*

So... Satin is from Old Town in The Reach. But he gets captured on the other side of Westeros,
In Gulltown in The Vale. This seems unusual. Why would he go there? Perhaps there's no mystery about it. He was there on 'work matter' or he simply decided to start his new life there. But the fact that he was captured so far away from where he's supposedly from seems to suggest that there's a mystery here. But more on that later.


*2. Satin Might Not Be who he says he is.*

There are some things that Satin says or does that don't sit right with his claimed background:

- He says ""my lord"" instead of ""m'lord"", which, as we know from Roose Bolton, a peasant would never say.

- He's (at least partially) literate. I am not sure if there's another literate whore (who was born and raised to be one) in the story, but to me there's not a good explanation for an average prostitute in Westeros to have that kind of education.

- He knows a girl in Old Town who used to put ice in her wine... And it's presumably very hard to keep ice from melting in the climate of Old Town. The girl must have been a highborn or rich. How would a boy whore get to know a highborn girl with ice in her wine?

- He keeps forgetting about the fire. Now, this one might be a bit reaching, but let's mention it anyway. In ADWD, Jon mentions that Satin is a good enough steward, only that he, unlike Edd, keeps forgetting about feeding his fire. Which is a bit strange, because this is the Wall we are talking about. A cold place, where fire should be like a priority or something. There might be some alternative explanations, but Tyrion offers a good one recalling his brief life with Tysha:

&gt; I never thought to feed the fire, that had always been a servant's task.


*3. The Old Gods*

Now, this one is not really that mysterious, but it's kind of odd anyway. Satin is from a place where the Seven are the usual religion of choice. (I might be wrong here, but I think that Satin even says, at one point, that he worships the New gods). However, when it's time for him to give his wovs to The Watch, he choses to go beyond the Wall and say them in front of the weirwood trees. Why? Truly, there could be multiple explanations to this and after all, he's not the only one who's not northern but swears the wovs there anyways. But it's still interesting.


**Satin And His Potential Ties To Other Plots**

The obvious plot Satin has ties to is Jon's arc as he's been around him for years now. But he has a potential to be connected to more than just that:

1. The Vale - he's been captured there and a person(s) of interest in The Vale who might have connection to Satin are Littlefinger and Lyn Corbray.

2. Old Town - he's from Old Town. He might be related to Hightowers or maybe the maesters.

3. Daenerys - okay, this one is a reach but hear me out. Dany should beware the perfumed seneschal. Satin fits this description. Of course, there's Saleasori Qhoran sailing her way who seems to be the more likely candidate, but it might be a red herring?


**Possible Theories On Who Or Why Is Satin**

**1. Luxurious Brothel**

This one is the most boring theory. Satin indeed is a whore but from a 'high end' brothel for the elite. He's good looking and might be a bastard, so he would be an ideal fit. This is why he speaks like a noble. He could *potentially* meet a girl who puts ice in her wine this way. I still fail to see, why he would be educated unless they were training their prostitues to also spy on their clients.

- pros: Satin would be telling the truth, Occam razor?

- cons: the literacy thing, Gulltown (unless he was later given to Lyn Corbray), we never hear about it


**2. Lyn Corbray's Boy**

We know from Littlefinger that Lyn Corbray is into ""boys"". Whether this means that he's gay or paedophile remains to be seen. It might be the reason why Satin was in the Vale. However, the seat of House Corbray isn't in Gulltown or anywhere near it. It would connect Satin with Littlefinger though.

- pros: The Vale, reasons for joining the Watch

- cons: not near Gulltown, the hints of noble origins


**3. Littlefinger's spy**

Who has connections to prostitues? Who has influence in The Vale? Who has ""his people"" everywhere? Oh, yes. Littlefinger to all three. It might just be that he sent Satin to the Wall when he found him at someone's dungeon and used him for his own gain. This might tie Satin and Jon through him to The Vale plot.

- pros: Sansa/Jon ties, reasons for joining the watch, perfect for spying

- cons: doesn't explain Satin's identity, what are the odds of LF finding Satin in a lord's dungeon and finding him suitable for the role (unless he placed him there himself but that's reaching), lack of LF's interest in the wall


**4. Noble boy forced to change his lifestyle due to the circumstances**

A possible explanation for many of the issues is that Satin suffered similiar fate to the likes of the Stark children or Ser Dontos. He was forced to abandon his childhood life of a highborn son of a lord and after that, he became a boy whore to make living. Maybe his house got destroyed. He would be raised as noble until the age of 8/9, so he would be partially literate, but not yet competent in combat.

- pros: explains a lot, Satin doesn't lie

- cons: no clue who he might be


**5. A Hightower or a Hightower bastard**

The Hightowers from Old Town are just as mysterious as Satin, perhaps even more. We know they have some magic shennanigans going on, so they might want to send one of their own to The Wall due to some visions they might have or something. Who knows what they are up to. Leyton Hightower has lots of kids. Most of them don't have any mentioned kids, but that doesn't mean they don't have them.

- pros: Old Town, noble, reasons to go to The Wall

- cons: incompetence in combat, Gulltown


**6. There's no mystery**

Satin is a boy whore from Old Town, who learnt to read himself, forgets to feed the fire because he forgets/wants Jon to call him because he has a crush on his lord commander, knows a girl who puts ice in her wine just because and ""my lord"" is a typo. He ran to Gulltown. Period. Satin is just a developed side character. He'll likely die soon, if he isn't dead already. Maybe He betrayed Jon like Olly. I'm just looking for something that isn't there.

I'm rereading ACOK and boy do these characters mess shit up. Arya could have killed Tywin or Cersei or anyone with enough time through Jaquen. She had an assassin that costs fortunes to hire at her disposal and she wasted two kills on commoners. 


I saw a post here defending how Edmure pushed Gregor back instead of leaving him to be captured later but Edmure really was stupid to let him go. He had a couple of men with him, had they let him through and later attacked him without the chance to retreat into a river they could have captured him and killed him or used him as a hostage.


It's arguable wether this is a fuckup or not but Stannis could have taken King's Landing instead of going for Renly's forces. Renly's entire argument for the throne was right of conquest, not Cersei being an adulterous and incestuous queen. Catelyn or someone else argues that had he taken the throne Renly could have supported him with the massive army.

But he couldn't forget lyanna and ruined his marriage he called cersei lyanna on their wedding night

The first thing he does when arrives at winterfell is pay his respects to lyanna

He was almost consumed by his hatred of all targaryens for they did to lyanna for the rest of his life and dreams about killing rhagar every night 

I feel like people sometimes act like Robert Just tells himself he loves lyanna to look like the hero and really dosnt care about her deep down 

He might not have known the real lyanna but he loved the idea of her in his head and thought about her everyday

948,"After suffering from a serious wound in his left wound and his enslaved maester failing to heal it, Victarion turns to Moqorro for help and strangely, the perspective changes from Victarion's perspective to the crew's perspective and then back to Victarion's perspective.

Victarion's first perspective;

&gt;They are all the same, these magic men. The mouse warned me of pain as well. ""I am ironborn, priest. I laugh at pain. You will have what you require … but if you fail, and my hand is not healed, I will cut your throat myself and give you to the sea.""
Moqorro bowed, his dark eyes shining. ""So be it.""

Then the crew's perspective;

&gt;Moqorro bowed, his dark eyes shining. ""So be it.""
The iron captain was not seen again that day, but as the hours passed **the crew of his Iron Victory reported hearing the sound of wild laughter coming from the captain's cabin, laughter deep and dark and mad**, and when Longwater Pyke and Wulfe One-Eye tried the cabin door they found it barred. Later **singing was heard, a strange high wailing song in a tongue the maester said was High Valyrian. That was when the monkeys left the ship, screeching as they leapt into the water.**

This whole event is quite suspicious, right down to the monkeys committing suicide to escape the sounds of Moqorro's singing.

And back to Victarion's perspective;

Come sunset, as the sea turned black as ink and the swollen sun tinted the sky a deep and bloody red, Victarion came back on deck. He was naked from the waist up, his left arm blood to the elbow. As his crew gathered, whispering and trading glances, he raised a charred and blackened hand. Wisps of dark smoke rose from his fingers as he pointed at the maester. ""That one. Cut his throat and throw him in the sea, and the winds will favor us all the way to Meereen."" Moqorro had seen that in his fires. He had seen the wench wed too, but what of it? She would not be the first woman Victarion Greyjoy had made a widow.

It is rather strange that George chooses to cut so sharply from perspective to perspective within so short time and be so vague about how Moqorro healed Victarion's arm, not just back to health but also turning it into a flaming weapon of sorts.

The theory that Victarion died in the cabin and was reanimated by Moqorro as a Fire Wight is quite popular among fans, indeed Moqorro's singing could be compared to Mirri Maz Duhr's singing when she tries to heal Khal Drogo. Do you all believe Victarion died in the cabin as well, rose again as UnVictarion and what consequences will this have for the future of the series?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Did Victarion Greyjoy die in ADWD?

956,"What is exactly a Bastard's  place in Westeros social structure, their overall perspective?

Consider Jon Snow. At first, we readers are led to believe that Bastards are shunned to an extent the Wall becomes the only place where a bastard may find acepptance, a place where any man can rise through ranks and earn respect.

But thats not quite true.

Bastards can become Maesters, Knights, Septons, members of the Kingsguard, they can be legitimized or even create their own house.

With that in mind , why is Jon so heavily burdened by it to the point he takes a vow binding his whole life to a miserable existence in a cold, harsh place filled with criminals?

It seems that being a bastard is not that big of a deal in the North, considering its a place that has a different religion and different customs compared to the rest of Westeros.

Consider House Stark, the oldest and most prestigious n the North :

\- Torrhen, the king who knelt, had his bastard brother, Brandon Snow, sent to negociate a peace treaty with Aegon I.

\- If we consider the legend of Bael the Bard to have some truth to it, then the starks had a antecessor that was legitimized.

964,"I’ve been always struck by the very obvious Builder/Breaker dichotomy that GRRM presents us with.  And considering how much he likes word play I assume he meant us to pick up on this.

I think the reason we haven’t often discussed the possibility that the Breaker undid the work of the Builder is we’ve been given a big fat red herring; we’re meant to think that Bran the Builder was this great architect of physical structures.  And perhaps he was involved in building the Wall or Winterfell, but more likely the meaning of his “Builder” moniker was lost throughout the millennia and taken too literally.

I think Bran the Builder was named no not for building any physical structures (even if he may have been an architect of one or two) but building alliances, pacts, friendships, or agreements.  We have one tale from TWOIAF of the Builder meeting with the COTF and learning their language.  (And the book notes the manner in which he learned to understand the COTF was is a “tale in itself”; the book doesn’t em entire an explanation, but likely blood magic and wedding himself to a weirwood.)

If this is true, then what alliance or pact did Bran the Builder make?  And how exactly was Bran the Breaker involved in breaking what was made by the Builder?  All were know of the Breaker is that he joined Joruman to bring down the Night’s King.  

Or perhaps are they literal?  I doubt it, but it’s possible.

If Bran the Builder built the Wall, did the Breaker (who’s explicitly stated to have worked with Joruman, owner of the fabled Horn of Winter) use the horn to destroy the Wall?  

Perhaps the Night’s King handing over babies to the White Walkers was seen as extremely dangerous and the Wall was brought down by the Horn of Winter so the Breaker could send his armies across the border and dispatch these baby-stealing WWs.  But the White Walkers were now enhanced (having been made from children of the Night’s Queen, likely a Barrowland sorceress with control of the dead) and could raise dead armies; then without the protection of the Wall the dead armies swept across Westeros without meaningful resistance.

What do you think?  Do you agree that Bran the Builder got his name as a primarily as figurative builder, and if so what figurative thing did he build.

At first Dany will be unstoppable, may even stop the Others with dragonfire but when she finally fights for the throne her armies will start getting sick and die, reducing her numbers and forcing her hand to make strategical mistakes.

Emilia Clarke has a British accent in show because Westroes is basically England and Scotland (except Dorne) and Essos is more Eurasia..but since Emilia Clarke grew up in Essos wouldn’t her accent sound more from Essos..same thing with I guess Young Griff, like I read them as British accents( because I watched the show before reading the series) but the more I push the show from memory..I read them in a different type of accent?

976,"Inside the Bloodraven's cave, Bran stark the greenseer looks through eyes of Winterfell's Weirwood tree and sees visions about history of House Stark.

First he sees his father, Eddard, praying

""**… but then somehow he was back at Winterfell again, in the godswood looking down upon his father. Lord Eddard seemed much younger this time. His hair was brown, with no hint of grey in it, his head bowed. ""… let them grow up close as brothers, with only love between them,"" he prayed, ""and let my lady wife find it in her heart to forgive …""**

**""Father."" Bran's voice was a whisper in the wind, a rustle in the leaves. ""Father, it's me. It's Bran. Brandon.""**

**Eddard Stark lifted his head and looked long at the weirwood, frowning, but he did not speak. He cannot see me, Bran realized, despairing. He wanted to reach out and touch him, but all that he could do was watch and listen. I am in the tree. I am inside the heart tree, looking out of its red eyes, but the weirwood cannot talk, so I can't. ""**

Like the first time he saw his father cleaning Ice, Bran tries to talk to his father who is now much younger, his prayer seem to be about Jon and Robb, and Catelyn forgiving him, Bran actually stays to listen to his prayer

**""Eddard Stark resumed his prayer. Bran felt his eyes fill up with tears. But were they his own tears, or the weirwood's? If I cry, will the tree begin to weep?""**

This reminds me about Bran's dream of his father in Winterfell crypts, iirc that dream wasn't pleasant too although we aren't giving any details. Next Bran sees two children playing

**""The rest of his father's words were drowned out by a sudden clatter of wood on wood. Eddard Stark dissolved, like mist in a morning sun. Now two children danced across the godswood, hooting at one another as they dueled with broken branches. The girl was the older and taller of the two. Arya! Bran thought eagerly, as he watched her leap up onto a rock and cut at the boy. But that couldn't be right. If the girl was Arya, the boy was Bran himself, and he had never worn his hair so long. And Arya never beat me playing swords, the way that girl is beating him. She slashed the boy across his thigh, so hard that his leg went out from under him and he fell into the pool and began to splash and shout. ""You be quiet, stupid,"" the girl said, tossing her own branch aside. ""It's just water. Do you want Old Nan to hear and run tell Father?"" She knelt and pulled her brother from the pool, but before she got him out again, the two of them were gone.""**

We know this vision happens earlier than Eddard's youth when Old Nan is servant of Winterfell, Old Nan come to Winterfell to be a wetnurse for a Brandon Stark, this Brandon is believed to be son of William Stark and Lyanne Glover, and the children are Lyanna and Benjen. But Bran thinks the boy is him which matters more to me than the girl being Arya, Bran has Tully look with blue eyes and red hair, Benjen is said to have blue-grey eyes of course but his hair color is never mentioned, if he is Benjen than where did the red hair come from? From House Locke? And Lyanna who is said to resemble Arya is also never described. 

But the visions are coming faster now and we move into a vision of a pregnant woman praying for a son to avenge her. This woman is said to be one of She Wolves of Winterfell, even Lorra Royce

**""but a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son to avenge her.""**

The woman wants God to avenge herself and unlike the fandom I think this woman could be Serena Stark, daughter of Rickon and Jeyne Manderly, who couldn't rule Winterfell after his father's death and was snubbed and married to a younger uncle Edric who never ruled Winterfell, she did give birth to twin sons though. But if the Knight in next vision is Dunk, can this place Serena earlier in time? If yes the woman could be Robyn Ryswell, I am skeptical of Myriame Manderly due to them believing in Faith, Ryswell lands were certainly raided by Dagon Greyjoy, Robyn would want someone to avenge her although w have no children listed for her. 

**""Then there came a brown-haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor.""**

Dunk &amp; Egg come to  Winterfell when Beron Stark call men to defend North, Old Nan would come to Winterfell later for son of Lyanne Glover, I think the girl with Dunk could be Beron's sister Arsa, Serena has two daughters, but they are married to an Umber and a Cerwyn, Beron's daughte would be younger than Donnel so I think the girl is Arsa Stark whose husband and children aren't listed. 

**""A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows. ""**

This man is identified as Brandon Snow, bastard brother of Torrhen Stark, who wanted to shoot dragons, if this is Brandon then he doesn't described with Stark look, dark eyes and pale but where is long face and grey eyes? And if this is Brandon, why there is a big gap between visions of First Lord Stark's time and Beron Stark's time? Could this man be Lonnel Snow instead who will be old enough to fight against Ironborn?

**""And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them. ""**

This vision is about Stark Kings, Bran knows abot Jon Stark, Rickon Stark, Brandon the Shipwright, Brandon the Burner, Theon the Hungry Wolf, but here he can't name them here. 

""**Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped toward them through a drift of dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand.** 

**""No,"" said Bran, ""no, don't, "" but they could not hear him, no more than his father had. The woman grabbed the captive by the hair, hooked the sickle round his throat, and slashed. And through the mist of centuries the broken boy could only watch as the man's feet drummed against the earth … but as his life flowed out of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could taste the blood.""**

**Dragon vs. Kraken**

&gt;""In the Seven Kingdoms, **there are tales of dragons who grew so huge that they could pluck giant krakens from the seas**."" -ASOS, Daenerys I

&gt;On the crown of the hill four-and-forty monstrous stone ribs rose from the earth like the trunks of great pale trees. The sight made Aeron's heart beat faster. **Nagga had been the first sea dragon, the mightiest ever to rise from the waves. She fed on krakens and leviathans and drowned whole islands in her wrath**, yet the Grey King had slain her and the Drowned God had changed her bones to stone so that men might never cease to wonder at the courage of the first of kings. Nagga's ribs became the beams and pillars of his longhall, just as her jaws became his throne. For a thousand years and seven he reigned here, Aeron recalled. Here he took his mermaid wife and planned his wars against the Storm God. From here he ruled both stone and salt, wearing robes of woven seaweed and a tall pale crown made from Nagga's teeth. -AFFC, The Drowned Man

and:

&gt;**The petrified bones of some gigantic sea creature do indeed stand on Nagga's Hill on Old Wyk, but whether they are actually the bones of a sea dragon remains open to dispute. The ribs are huge, but nowise near large enough to have belonged to a dragon capable of feasting on leviathans and giant krakens**. In truth, the very existence of sea dragons has been called into question by some. If such monsters do exist, they must surely dwell in the deepest, darkest reaches of the Sunset Sea, for none has been seen in the known world for thousands of years. -TWOIAF: The Iron Islands: Driftwood Crowns

***

**Dragon vs. Firewyrm**

Since the Valyrian dragons were most likely created from interbreeding firewyrms and wyverns/dragons (debated) this borders on same species, but since because of the horror that Barth felt and the fact that a dragon large enough to swallow a mammoth whole was covered in injuries made me feel I should at least mention it.

***

**Mammoth vs. Elephant**

The only way I see this happening is if the the Golden Company or their elephants survive the Dance of the Dragons II and are able to fight in the Battle for the Dawn. As the mammoths are too large to pass through the Wall, they head to Eastwatch by the Sea:

&gt;Two score captives lingered by the stockade. **Four giants were among them, massive hairy creatures with sloped shoulders, legs as large as tree trunks, and huge splayed feet. Big as they were, they might still have passed through the Wall, but one would not leave his mammoth, and the others would not leave him.** The rest of those who remained were all of human stature. Some were dead and some were dying; more were their kin or close companions, unwilling to abandon them even for a bowl of onion soup. -ADWD, Jon III

There are at least 80 mammoths alive:

&gt;Queen Selyse gave the tiniest of nods. ""It was ever my lord husband's wish to grant sanctuary to these savage peoples. So long as they keep the king's peace and the king's laws, they are welcome in our realm."" She pursed her lips. ""I am told they have more giants with them.""

&gt;**Val answered. ""Almost two hundred of them, Your Grace. And more than eighty mammoths.""**

&gt;The queen shuddered. ""Dreadful creatures."" Jon could not tell if she was speaking of the mammoths or the giants. ""Though such beasts might be useful to my lord husband in his battles."" -ADWD, Jon XI

The Golden Company has at least 24 elephants:

&gt;They found the Golden Company beside the river as the sun was lowering in the west. It was a camp that even Arthur Dayne might have approved of—compact, orderly, defensible. A deep ditch had been dug around it, with sharpened stakes inside. The tents stood in rows, with broad avenues between them. The latrines had been placed beside the river, so the current would wash away the wastes. The horse lines were to the north, and beyond them, **two dozen elephants grazed beside the water, pulling up reeds with their trunks.** Griff glanced at the great grey beasts with approval. There is not a warhorse in all of Westeros that will stand against them. -ADWD, The Lost Lord

But the elephants were late to arriving to Westeros, with only a few known to have landed:

&gt;**The prince arrived to join them four days later, riding at the head of a column of a hundred horse, with three elephants lumbering in his rear**. Lady Lemore was with him, garbed once more in the white robes of a septa. Before them went Ser Rolly Duckfield, a snow-white cloak streaming from his shoulders. -ADWD, The Griffin Reborn

and:

&gt;""Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,"" said Valena. ""These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones. **We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood**."" -TWOW, Arianne I

and:

&gt;""And no elephants,"" the Halfmaester reminded him. **Not one of the great cogs carrying the elephants had turned up yet. They had last seen them at Lys, before the storm that had scattered half the fleet.** ""Horses can be found in Westeros. Elephants—""

""—do not matter."" The great beasts would be useful in a pitched battle, no doubt, but it would be some time before they had the strength to face their foes in the field. ""Have those parchments told you anything of use?"" -ADWD, The Griffin Reborn

**White Ravens vs. Black Ravens**

We know the black ravens are often controlled by Bloodraven/Bran, but we also know that the Citadel has special intelligent white ravens and the two kinds hate each other:

&gt;It was cool and dim inside the castle walls. An ancient weirwood filled the yard, as it had since these stones had first been raised. The carved face on its trunk was grown over by the same purple moss that hung heavy from the tree's pale limbs. Half of the branches seemed dead, but elsewhere a few red leaves still rustled, and it was there the ravens liked to perch. The tree was full of them, and there were more in the arched windows overhead, all around the yard. The ground was speckled by their droppings. As they crossed the yard, one flapped overhead and he heard the others quorking to each other. ""Archmaester Walgrave has his chambers in the west tower, below the white rookery,"" Alleras told him. **""The white ravens and the black ones quarrel like Dornishmen and Marchers, so they keep them apart.""** -AFFC, Samwell V

**Direwolf vs. Giant Boar**

&gt;**Amongst the riders came one man afoot, with some big beast trotting at his heels. A boar, Jon saw. A monstrous boar. Twice the size of Ghost, the creature was covered with coarse black hair, with tusks as long as a man's arm. Jon had never seen a boar so huge or ugly.** The man beside him was no beauty either; hulking, black-browed, he had a flat nose, heavy jowls dark with stubble, small black close-set eyes. -ADWD, Jon XIII

and:

&gt;""Borroq."" Tormund turned his head and spat.

&gt;""A skinchanger."" It was not a question. Somehow he knew.

&gt;**Ghost turned his head. The falling snow had masked the boar's scent, but now the white wolf had the smell. He padded out in front of Jon, his teeth bared in a silent snarl.** -ADWD, Jon XIII

and:

&gt;""Asleep in my chambers. Her Grace does not allow Ghost in her presence. She claims he scares the princess. **And so long as Borroq and his boar are about, I dare not let him loose."" The skinchanger was to accompany Soren Shieldbreaker to Stonedoor once the wayns carrying the Sealskinner's clan to Greenguard returned. Until such time, Borroq had taken up residence in one of the ancient tombs beside the castle lichyard. The company of men long dead seemed to suit him better than that of the living, and his boar seemed happy rooting amongst the graves, well away from other animals. ""That thing is the size of a bull, with tusks as long as swords. Ghost would go after him if he were loose, and one or both of them would not survive the meeting.**"" -ADWD, Jon XIII

and:

&gt;Especially when it concerned the free folk, where their disapproval went bone deep. When Jon settled Stonedoor on Soren Shieldbreaker, Yarwyck complained that it was too isolated. How could they know what mischief Soren might get up to, off in those hills? When he conferred Oakenshield on Tormund Giantsbane and Queensgate on Morna White Mask, Marsh pointed out that Castle Black would now have foes on either side who could easily cut them off from the rest of the Wall. As for Borroq, Othell Yarwyck claimed the woods north of Stonedoor were full of wild boars. Who was to say the skinchanger would not make his own pig army? -ADWD, Jon XIII

Borroq and his boar are such mysterious characters. I have a couple thoughts on him as well, but I don't want to make this post too long. So just comment if interested.

**Direwolf vs. Shadowcat**

&gt;Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right. He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket. ""Ghost,"" he called. ""Here. To me."" He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur. This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him. Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone. He wants to hunt, Jon thought. Perhaps there were goats in these mountains. The shadowcats must live on something. **""Just don't try and bring down a 'cat,"" he muttered. Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous.** He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock. -ACOK, Jon VII

**Direwolf vs. Unicorn**

&gt;Far off, he could hear his packmates calling to him, like to like. They were hunting too. **A wild rain lashed down upon his black brother as he tore at the flesh of an enormous goat, washing the blood from his side where the goat's long horn had raked him**. In another place, his little sister lifted her head to sing to the moon, and a hundred small grey cousins broke off their hunt to sing with her. The hills were warmer where they were, and full of food. Many a night his sister's pack gorged on the flesh of sheep and cows and horses, the prey of men, and sometimes even on the flesh of man himself. -ADWD, Jon I

and Unicorns will appear in TWOW according to GRRM on Neil Degrasse Tyson's ""Starktalk"" and possibly ""sex near the unicorns"" according to a google translate of [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20140925153657/http://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/romans/20140808.OBS5924/george-r-r-martin-j-aime-tuer-mes-personnages.html) article.

**Direwolf vs. Hounds**

Possibly foreshadowed in this [ghost story](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/g5gi80/ghost_stories_of_ice_and_fire_spoilers_extended/) about Symeon Star Eyes:

&gt;It was here that Night's King had reigned, before his name was wiped from the memory of man. This was where the Rat Cook had served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie, where the seventy-nine sentinels stood their watch, where brave young Danny Flint had been raped and murdered. This was the castle where King Sherrit had called down his curse on the Andals of old, where the 'prentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night, **where blind Symeon Star-Eyes had seen the hellhounds fighting**. Mad Axe had once walked these yards and climbed these towers, butchering his brothers in the dark. -ASOS, Bran IV
 
as well as possibly here:

&gt;""I have been spared that, Seven save me, but I have heard them in the night, and more than once. So many voices . . . a sound to curdle a man's blood. **It even set Dog to shivering, and Dog has killed a dozen wolves."" He ruffled the dog's head. ""Some will tell you that they are demons. They say the pack is led by a monstrous she-wolf, a stalking shadow grim and grey and huge. They will tell you that she has been known to bring aurochs down all by herself, that no trap nor snare can hold her, that she fears neither steel nor fire, slays any wolf that tries to mount her, and devours no other flesh but man**."" -AFFC, Brienne V

Ramsay is known to have bred dogs to kill wolves:

The fight did not end until their host's dog was dead. Stout's old hound never stood a mummer's chance. He had been one against two, and Ramsay's bitches were young, strong, and savage. Ben Bones, who liked the dogs better than their master, had told Reek they were all named after peasant girls Ramsay had hunted, raped, and killed back when he'd still been a bastard, running with the first Reek. ""The ones who give him good sport, anywise. The ones who weep and beg and won't run don't get to come back as bitches."" The next litter to come out of the Dreadfort's kennels would include a Kyra, Reek did not doubt. **""He's trained 'em to kill wolves as well,"" Ben Bones had confided. Reek said nothing. He knew which wolves the girls were meant to kill**, but he had no wish to watch the girls fighting over his severed toe. -ADWD, Reek III

and:

&gt;""Stark's little wolflings are dead,"" said Ramsay, sloshing some more ale into his cup, ""and they'll stay dead. 

&gt;**Let them show their ugly faces, and my girls will rip those wolves of theirs to pieces.** The sooner they turn up, the sooner I kill them again."" -ADWD, Reek III

We also know from this [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-last-script-the-lion-and-the-rose) article that GRRM at least originally intended a showdown between the hounds and one or more Stark Direwolves:

&gt;Martin leaves a little note for the producers when writing about Ramsay’s flesh-eating hounds, whom we see hunting down a girl for sport.

&gt;N.B. A note for future reference. **A season or two down the line Ramsay’s pack of wolfhounds are going to be sent against the Stark direwolves, so we should build up the dogs as much as possible in this and subsequent episodes.** 

And while that never happened (which could be for a variety of reasons) and its also possible that GRRM could have changed his mind on that plot point, I still felt it was very necessary to include here.

***

It should also be noted that due to the nature of the series that any number of these creatures could be ""undead"" or wighted during these encounters. As we have seen wighted horses, bears, etc. and heard rumors of dragons, etc.

I would also like to reiterate that some of the above quotes include rumors and exaggerations and therefore not every one should be taken verbatim.

Also the fact that I left out things like dragon v. dragon and dragon v. ice dragon because it would have been the longest post ever and all the focus would have been on that part.

982,"Okay, I’m not retarded. Game of Thrones is literally AN ASOIAF tv-series, but must it be THE tv-series.

Here me out. Everyone who have read the books and seen the show can agree that they cut more than half of the story out of the show (both good and bad parts). 

That would mean that a remake of the show could work as long as you make sure having (f)Aegon and lady stoneheart in it. It would be refreshing for people that only watched the show as at least 50% is new at the same time as book readers would get the satisfying series needed to represent these books.

Why would a producer want to make a remake? Because it’s a proven concept and with a little better execution would catch all the world again.

The biggest problem I can think of is that this would need Martin to finish the series but with recent news and because of Corona, it’s actually possible that he will.

985,"I’m reading through ADWD for the first time and I’m struck by Stannis’ hypocrisy. One of his main traits is his unwavering commitment to his duty that he sees as bound by the laws of the realm. However, he constantly presses Jon to take up the role of Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, making Jon remind him every time that Jon is sworn to the Night’s Watch (and that the Watch takes no part). In one passage, Stannis is disgusted by Jon saying this again and calls him stubborn and mocks his sense of honor (and by extension, duty). Does he not care about anyone else’s duty but his? I can see him justifying it by saying the realm needs the Watch’s help, he’s the rightful king and he commands it, yadda yadda yadda. However, say the Watch aids Stannis, the war comes to an end and there is left with one king on the throne- wouldn’t the Night’s Watch vows be seen as meaningless and broken going forward?

990,"With the possibility that the knights of the Vale may start assembling in the coming books, it got me thinking about all the possible knights sworn to House Arryn who might turn up.

One I keep coming back to is kinsgaurd member Ser Mandon Moore, who we are told drowned in the Blackwater after disfiguring Tyrion and being knocked into the water by Podrik Payne. His ""offscreen"" drowning, with no body and no wound, was such a convenient event for Tyrion and Pod that it has always struck me as odd that Tyrion did not concern himself with it more.

If Moore showed up, it would spell bad news for Pod and for Tyrion. But the fact Pod seems unconcerned may mean he is certain that Moore did in fact drown under the weight of his own armor.

However, with the Vale likely to take center stage, the multiple mysteries surrounding Moore seem ripe for further explanation. Why was he in the kingsguard anyway, when clearly Jon Arryn didn't care for him? Was he a catspaw for Lady Lysa? Could his failure to kill and silence tyrion have led him to flee the blackwater and return to the Vale in hiding?

And perhaps most tantalizing, would he recognize Sansa, and she him? Sansa could make some hay out of a disgraced, craven, girl-beating Kingsguard in hiding in the Vale. What would Moore do to avoid exposure?

992,"Martin has teased the prologue for ‘The Winds of Winter’ more than any other chapter from the (hopefully) upcoming novel.

We know that Jeyne Westerling will appear in the chapter, though she is not necessarily the viewpoint character.  When last we saw Jeyne, she was being escorted to Casterly Rock under the orders of Ser Jaime Lannister along with her mother and Edmure Tully.  This party was being led by Ser Forley Prester, upon their departure Jaime recommends that Prester takes extra care with Jeyne as she would be twice as dangerous should she escape. 

Jeyne’s inclusion gives us the indication that the chapter must be set somewhere between Riverrun and Casterly Rock.

We also know that Jaime is aware of the size of Nymeria’s growing wolf pack in the Riverlands.  We know that Jamie’s party that is hunting the Blackfish is running into the wolf pack on a regular basis.

In her ‘Mercy’ chapter, Arya has a violent wolf dream but this wolf dream lacks a lot of the detail of most of the other wolf dreams.  There are three possible explanations for this:

1.) Mercy, a different character to Arya, struggles to interpret anything that happens in the dreams and so can’t remember them - but this seems unlikely as she does remember some of the details, the wolf running in the sight of the moon and the tree.

2.) Nothing of significance happens and this is a wolf dream like any other - but if it was, where is the detail?

3.) something very significant happens in the wolf dream - my preferred option.

The chapter starts with Mercy waking up from a dream - startled - it wasn’t a normal mundane wolf dream.  If you think about when you wake up with a start from a dream it is due to a shock or nightmare.  We know there was blood in the dream and a tree that watched her, oh and blood.  This leads to questions: whose blood? Where is the tree? What startled her?

Perhaps Mercy can’t have wolf dreams and that is why we don’t live the dream through the character?

When Nymeria pulls Cat’s body from the Trident we view the event from Arya’s viewpoint through the dream.  It is a significant event contained within the dream.  So this raises the question of why we are not privy to it this time around?

I’m suggesting that the events contained in the wolf dream are the events of The Winds of Winter prologue.  Structurally this could be quite interesting: prologue straight into Mercy.

I’ve seen Forley Prester suggested as the viewpoint character, but I wonder whether he is significant enough to cause Arya to wake with a start.

Is it possible Ser Ilyn is the viewpoint character?  

He isn’t in exactly the right place, but he would make a lot of sense in terms of MO with GRRM.  Ilyn can’t speak or write, so the only way that we will be able to understand his history is through his own viewpoint.  I imagine that the words he said that caused Aerys to rip his tongue out would go round his head like a mantra in a similar to: serve, obey, protect - or Arya’s prayer - or kill the boy.  He is also on Arya’s list and inspires terror/fear in people.

999,"Okay. Obviously, I know this theory is a long shot, as Rickon died in the TV series. However, the Azor Ahai prophecy wasn't fulfilled either, so maybe his death is indicative of that? The prophecy couldn't be fulfilled in this timeline because the person it applied to is dead.

This is also my first theory on here and I'm not exactly an expert, so I could easily be writing something that someone's already posted or that GRRM has expressly rejected. Go easy on me? :)

So I was writing something and realized a lot of the Azor Ahai prophecy that Melisandre gives to Jon could actually apply to *Rickon,* strangely enough. Of course. as Rickon is not exactly in focus, it would mean the story is about the people who assist him, not about the traditional hero himself. Much like how Robb could have stood for a traditional hero, Rickon can as well, acting as more of a symbol than a 'hero.' It would make sense, while being completely unexpected because Rickon's story was told through eyes other than his own.

So here is the prophecy:

&gt;""*When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."" --* Melisandre to Jon Snow, A Dance With Dragons, Jon X

Here are the symbols in that prophecy, and what they could mean in the Rickon interpretation.

* The Bleeding Star

I honestly think it's quite clear that the red star refers to the red comet that appears in the first book. However, 'bleeding' might not necessarily refer to the comet's movement, though it could. It could also refer to the execution of Eddard Stark.

More importantly, however, the red comet falls the same day the news of Ned's execution arrives at Winterfell.

&gt;*The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky. --* A Game of Thrones, Bran VII.

This chapter is written from Bran's point of view. Shortly after, Maester Luwin and Osha take Bran into the crypts to see that Eddard's tomb is empty, as the night before he'd had a dream that Ned was down there. However, they don't find Ned, but they do find Rickon and Shaggydog.

Bran having the dream makes sense- he's a greenseer, and has the most ties to magic out of the Starks. However, why would Rickon have that dream? He's had no indications of greenseeing or being closely tied to magic in the past, and none of the other Starks have these dreams besides Bran and Rickon. It's also a possibility that Bran was sharing Rickon's dream.

&gt;""*Rickon,"" Bran said softly. ""Father's not here.""*  
*""Yes he is. I saw him."" Tears glistened on Rickon's face. ""I saw him last night.""*  
*""In your dream . . . ?""*  
*Rickon nodded. ""You leave him. You leave him be. He's coming home now, like he promised. He's coming home.""*  
*Bran had never seen Maester Luwin took so uncertain before.*

Shaggy also attacks Luwin and Summer, drawing blood on both of them, which could also refer to the 'bleeding' part. Luwin takes Bran and Rickon back to his chambers and tells them both about the Children, the Pact, dragonglass, et cetera. Why should Rickon be present for this conversation? Even Luwin says he is too young to understand. Unless his presence should indicate that what is happening somehow involves him.

The raven carrying news of Eddard's death arrives and lands on Luwin's arm, gathering blood on its wings as well. A whole bunch of imagery concerning grief ensues as Bran and Rickon both realize the news that the raven carries.

&gt;*The howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Summer padded across the tower floor to Shaggydog, and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brother's neck. From the window came a flutter of wings.*  
*A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress.*  
***Rickon began to cry. His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor. Bran pulled him close and hugged him.***

This grief could signal rebirth for Rickon, as after his father's death he becomes even more wild and argumentative than before, all caused by the death of his father, which the red comet heralded the news of.

* Darkness gathering

This is possibly the most vague part of the prophecy, as it could refer to just about anything bad. In this interpretation, I'd be inclined to believe that the gathering darkness refers to the war of the Five Kings as it's what is caused directly by Eddard Stark's death.

* Reborn amidst salt and smoke.

As I already said, I believe the rebirth is more tied to Ned's execution than to salt and smoke, but Rickon also goes into the wild after the sacking of Winterfell.

Salt- The Greyjoys, the sea swallowing Winterfell in Jojen Reed's dreams, or the seas at White Harbor, where Osha originally took Rickon.

Smoke- The burning of Winterfell.

Up until now, everything in this prophecy could refer to Bran as well, and it very well might. However, It is the next part that grabs my attention.

* Waking dragons out of stone.

As we know as of *A Dance of Dragons,* Osha had now taken Rickon to Skagos (true, knowing is a bit relative, as we aren't exactly sure where they are, but it seems to be the most popular theory and the one with the most evidence to back up). Skagos, in the old tongue, means 'stone,' and we don't really know what Rickon has gotten up to over there. It is a place shrouded in mystery.

Straight up, I don't have any ideas about the dragons. Could it be referring to the people of Skagos, implying that Rickon may bring some people back to help in the long night? Maybe. Could Rickon be training the Stark warging ability, and warg into a dragon? Maybe. The 'waking dragons out of stone' part sets him apart from Bran, definitely, but the dragons confuse me more.

\--

I think most of my conviction in this theory comes from it making quite a bit of narrative sense.

A lot of the debate over Azor Ahai argues over which of the characters is the ""main,"" or ""most important"". No one would argue that Rickon is the most important Stark at this point, and even if he is the one fulfilling the prophecy his role wouldn't be any larger. Simply put, there is no main character- elevating any of the existing POV characters to be Azor Ahai would create one.

Also, Rickon's presence doesn't make much sense if he doesn't have some role to play in the story. In the show, he is just kind of... there. He dies in the Battle of the Bastards and serves to fuel Jon's fury, but this is a move that makes him an object, not a character in his own right.

The theory also makes me think that the reason why Azor Ahai didn't become the ending in the show was because they'd killed off the character already-- but even if he hadn't died in S6, they ruined it by making a slight change from the books in S3. This change being Osha expressly stating that she and Rickon are going to the Umbers, instead of implying they went to the Umbers OR White Harbor. The show writers made a slight change to the dialogue, thinking they wouldn't change all that much by picking one of two options, and didn't realize they'd picked the wrong one until years later.

\--

I don't think Rickon is the most likely candidate to be Azor Ahai-- far from it actually- but when I realized Skagos meant 'stone' and that the sacking of Winterfell meant 'salt and smoke' I began to wonder.

&gt; BELLEGERE OTHERYS (THE BLACK PEARL OF BRAAVOS): Smuggler, trader, sometime pirate, captain of the Widow Wind, born of a union between a Braavosi merchant's daughter and an envoy from the Summer Isles

&gt; After Naerys fell pregnant and almost died in 161, King Baelor sent Aegon to Braavos on a diplomatic mission. Accounts of the time suggest it was an excuse to make certain Aegon left Naerys alone as she recovered from a failed childbirth. There he met Bellegere Otherys. His affair with the Black Pearl continued for ten years, though it was said that Bellegere had a husband in every port and that Aegon was but one of many. She gave birth to three children during the decade, two girls and a boy of doubtful paternity. Children by the Black Pearl: Bellenora, Narha, Balerion.

That’s a lot of background. But to summarize:
 
Her grandmother, also called Bellegere Otherys, was the daughter of a Summer Island princess and the son of a Sealord of Braavos. She has a lot of political connections already. To add more, she became the lover of many among whom even Aegon IV, just to add to her political connections. And she was involved in trade, smuggling and piracy. Certainly got away with them because of her connections. 

Her mother, Bellonara Otherys started a family tradition as a courtesan, which she herself continues and courtesans are highly regarded in Braavosi society. 

Honestly, the more I read, the more I think the family is still very politically connected and powerful, but keeps thing on the down low, with ‘courtesan’ as a front.

This might come into play, because the current Sealord of Braavos is dying:

&gt; The Sealord is still sick.""

&gt; ""This is no new thing. The Sealord was sick yesterday, and he will still be sick upon the morrow.""

&gt; ""Or dead.""

&gt; **When he is dead, there will be a choosing, and the knives will come out. That was the way of it in Braavos. In Westeros, a dead king was followed by his eldest son, but the Braavosi had no kings.** ""Tormo Fregar will be the new sealord.""

&gt; ""Is that what they are saying at the Inn of the Green Eel?""

&gt; The kindly man took a bite of his egg. The girl heard him chewing. He never spoke with his mouth full. He swallowed, and said, ""Some men say there is wisdom in wine. Such men are fools. At other inns other names are being bruited about, never doubt."" He took another bite of egg, chewed, swallowed. ""What three new things do you know, that you did not know before?""

&gt; ""I know that some men are saying that Tormo Fregar will surely be the new sealord,"" she answered. ""Some drunken men.""

&gt; ""Better. And what else do you know?"" - the Ugly Little Girl, ADWD

and Mercy had an interesting key, perhaps for keyholders?

&gt; It was a real mummer's cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She'd hid some coins in one of those, **an iron key in another**, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told. 

To summarize, Mercy hid in her cloak: an iron key, a fruit knife, and a real blade. We are told the fruit knife belongs to Mercy, it’s revealed the blade belongs to Arya when she killed Raff, and then there’s the key that doesn’t belong to Mercy, but we know it doesn’t belong to Arya either because FM do not allow her to have her own things, even though she made an exception with Needle. What is the key for? Keyholders are the only hint we have.

The Sealord is going to die soon, and there will be an election. FM are going to interfere because they already gave Arya a mission with keys. Bellegere Otherys will be involved somehow too.

Oberyn Martell: y’all might make the mistake and assume that this mf will have the largest schlong in Dorne, but he probably has a very average size. It is solely the charisma and looks that carry this man. 

Eddard Stark: this guy probably has the biggest dick around, but due to being honorable and chaste, he never really shows it off. Keeps it lowkey. Cersei probably kept it after they executed him ngl. 

Robert Baratheon: Average to above average, but smaller than Ned’s. I can picture them takin a piss after a campaign during the rebellion and him lookin over and being like “GODS NED IF I HAD ONE THAT LARGE I’D HAVE BANGED HALF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS BY NOW” and Ned would probably laugh it off.

Petyr Baelish: Absolute micropenis. No question. Emits small dick energy and everyone knows it. Lysa Arryn prob said some shit like “size dosent matter” and he believed it. Catelyn knows he got a small one and he never got over it.

Stannis Baratheon: this man packin. No doubt. This dude is obviously not azor Ahai but Melisandre still follows him around.

Tywin Lannister: ngl he is probably below average but it does not matter because the power is what makes ppl thirst over him. 

Euron Greyjoy: this man has an absolute fukin anaconda down there and it’s unnatural. Probably makes anyone that interacts with it hurt on the inside. He’s the type of dude to absolutely hate fuck you then dump you in the ocean. ~10 inch minimum. 

Robb Stark: literally every Stark is packin. even Arya. Blood of the first men is strong.  His downfall was just simpin for some westerlands girl smh 

Jon Snow: Above average. emits big dick energy. Val, Alys Karstark, Ygritte, and eventually Dany want/will want to bang him. He’s just one of those dudes who never really learned how to talk to girls and is lowkey kinda awkward due to his upbringing.

Theon Greyjoy: Probably the type of dude to claim he has a big penis, but really has an average sized to below average sized one. Lotta women prob told him that just to make him feel better. He don’t gotta worry about all that anymore tho lmao

Joffrey Baratheon: 

You would probably want him to have a small penis but this is simply not the case. He’s the opposite of Theon. He prob gotta big penis and is one of those dudes that WILL brag about it.

&gt;**""I made no such claim. The Starks were nothing to me. I will say, I think it passing odd that I am loved by one for a kindness I never did, and reviled by so many for my finest act**. At Robert's coronation, I was made to kneel at the royal feet beside Grand Maester Pycelle and Varys the eunuch, so that he might forgive us our crimes before he took us into his service. As for your Ned, he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys, but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Robert's throne. I think Ned Stark loved Robert better than he ever loved his brother or his father . . . or even you, my lady. He was never unfaithful to Robert, was he?"" Jaime gave a drunken laugh. ""Come, Lady Stark, don't you find this all terribly amusing?""

&gt;""I find nothing about you amusing, Kingslayer."" -ACOK, Catelyn VII

Brienne currently has sworn numerous vows to Lady Catelyn = Lady Stoneheart:

&gt;The tall girl knelt awkwardly, unsheathed Renly's longsword, and laid it at her feet. **""Then I am yours, my lady. Your liege man, or . . . whatever you would have me be. I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours, if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.""**

&gt;""And I vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and meat and mead at my table, and pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you into dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise."" As she clasped the other woman's hands between her own, Catelyn could not help but smile. How many times did I watch Ned accept a man's oath of service? She wondered what he would think if he could see her now. -ACOK, Catelyn V

So both of them swore vows to characters who were or later evolved into ""madness"".

And while we know that the word Brienne said to Lady Stoneheart was [sword](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6425/) it should be noted that in the instance she basically reaffirmed her oath and vows to Lady Stoneheart.

And while Jaime/Brienne are currently facing some big issues on [Survivor: The Brotherhood Without Banners](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ey87np/surviving_lady_stoneheart_theories_welcome/), Brienne will surely come face to face with same decision that Jaime mentions to Balon Swann about [his brother](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/g933w8/swann_vs_swann_ser_donnel_the_constant_spoilers/):

&gt;""It's not Ser Donnel the Constant who concerns me. It's you."" Jaime leaned forward. ""What will you do if brave Ser Donnel gives his sword to yet another usurper, and one day comes storming into the throne room?

&gt;And there you stand all in white, between your king and your blood. What will you do?""

&gt;""I . . . my lord, that will never happen.""

&gt;**""It happened to me,"" Jaime said.**

&gt;**""My lord."" Ser Balon drew himself up. ""On my sword, on my honor, on my father's name, I swear . . . I shall not do as you did.""**

&gt;Jaime laughed. ""Good. Return to your duties . . . and tell Ser Donnel to add a weathervane to his shield."" -ASOS, Jaime VIII

***

So in summary GRRM wrote us right back to a place where Brienne is going to have to choose between her love for a person as compared to the vows she swore. Obviously some other factors could come into play, but I cant wait to read Brienne understanding Jaime's decision about Aerys more (even if we don't have a confirmed Brienne TWOW chapter yet).

And while Brienne exemplifies a ""true knight"" and I hope makes the most honorable decisions she can make, I can't help but think about a couple other quotes that fit here as well:

&gt;""Justice."" Thoros smiled wanly. ""I remember justice. It had a pleasant taste. Justice was what we were about when Beric led us, or so we told ourselves. We were king's men, knights, and heroes . . . but **some knights are dark and full of terror, my lady. War makes monsters of us all.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII

and:

&gt;""With your sword. Oathkeeper, you call it? **Then keep your oath to her, milady says.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII

We also know of three noble houses of Skagos, but house Magnar seems to be the most important one.

In Storm, Donal Noye mentions that Magnar is a house from Skagos and that when he arrived at Eastwatch by the Sea, he saw a group of Skagosis talking about Lord Magnar.

1025,"&gt;King Aerys made a great show of Jaime's investiture. He said his vows before the king's pavilion, kneeling on the green grass in white armor while half the realm looked on. When Ser Gerold Hightower raised him up and put the white cloak about his shoulders, a roar went up that Jaime still remembered, all these years later. But that very night Aerys had turned sour, declaring that he had no need of seven Kingsguard here at Harrenhal. Jaime was commanded to return to King's Landing to guard the queen and little Prince Viserys, who'd remained behind. Even when the White Bull offered to take that duty himself, so Jaime might compete in Lord Whent's tourney, Aerys had refused. ""He'll win no glory here,"" the king had said. ""He's mine now, not Tywin's. He'll serve as I see fit. I am the king. I rule, and he'll obey.""
That was the first time that Jaime understood. It was not his skill with sword and lance that had won him his white cloak, nor any feats of valor he'd performed against the Kingswood Brotherhood. **Aerys had chosen him to spite his father, to rob Lord Tywin of his heir.**

Its repeated throughout the series the key reasons why Jaime wanted to join the Kingsguard through both him and Cersei's POVs; Jaime never cared for being a lord and instead hungered for battle, while also wanting to be close to Cersei who was convinced that she would one day marry Prince Rhaegar and spend the rest of her life in King's Landing meaning serving in the Kingsguard would be the only way that he could be near her. Jaime's life in the Kingsguard has life-changing ramifications for both himself and all of Westeros, particularly in the case of killing Aerys II and preventing him from burning King's Landing to the ground and killing the population there.

But what if Jaime Lannister chose not to join the Kingsguard? What if for whatever reason, Jaime didn't form that kind of relationship with Cersei, or believed she wasn't going to marry Rhaegar or didn't want to give up his claim to Casterly Rock - what if instead Jaime decided not to join the Kingsguard and lived on to be Tywin's heir as Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?

For me this What If scenario has major ramifications for the future of ASOIAF;

1.) Not joining the Kingsguard means that Jaime wouldn't have been able to stop Aerys II from burning King's Landing to the ground and gone on to forever be looked down upon as a Kingslayer - this severely damages the political system of Westeros with the capital being burned to the ground by its former King but leaves House Lannister in a much stronger position.

2.) It is likely Tywin would've had Jaime marry Lysa Tully who he had tried to court towards when Jaime was younger and spent time in Riverrun. This marriage could've pushed for the Lannisters to have joined the Rebel's cause at the start of the Rebellion, or Tywin could've used Lysa being in Casterly Rock as leverage against the Rebels to keep them from attacking the Targaryens if Aerys had promised him something in return.

3.) Jaime not being in the Kingsguard and being able to father Cersei's children means there is no succession crisis or War of the Five Kings - Ned lives, the Starks live in peace, the Baratheons live in peace - or potentially there is still a similar crisis but it might've been with someone like Lancel Lannister instead of Jaime.

4.) Finally, Jaime's status as Lord of Casterly Rock might've allowed him to arrange a better marriage for Tyrion or at least allow him to run off with Tysha and give him a happier life. Tywin might've even opted to let Jaime become the next Hand of the King instead of him after Robert died.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) What if Jaime Lannister never joined the Kingsguard?

1029,"So of all important families in Westeros, two very relrvant lords have been suspiciously absent from the story. One is Howland Reed, which will probably appear later, and the other, Leyton Hightower, locked for twenty years in his tower with his daughter.

I believe GRRM may have made them important in F&amp;B because they will be important in later books.

1. Euron is attacking Oldtown
2. The origin of house Hightower (and perhaps GEOTD)
3. The origin of the Hightower and Battle Island

1031,"I am selectively rereading A Game of Thrones and I noticed something strange in a conversation between Ned and Robert regarding the Dothraki invasion and the Warden of the East in Eddard II:

&gt;”It’s Jaime Lannister, is it not?” ... “Yes”...
“An able and courageous man, no doubt,” he said carefully, “but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West.”

The very need to have such a conversation means that the title of Warden is not necessarily hereditary, or else it would automatically go to Robert Arryn. Traditionally, however, the Lord of Casterly Rock is the Warden of the West. So Ned’s concern here is that when Tywin dies, Jaime will inherit Casterly Rock and assume the position of Warden of the West. 

But Jaime is a Kingsguard. He can’t inherit lands or titles. The only way this could happen is if Jaime leaves the Kingsguard. We know from conversations between Tywin and Tyrion that he would never inherit the Rock. So was this Tyson’s plan from the beginning, and is it known that he wanted to remove his son from the Kingsguard at some point before his death?

**A list of fever dreams that take place in ASOIAF**

***

#Background

Some fever dreams are apparently somewhat magical:

&gt;All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found their way to Qarth; **buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose, violet, and umber**. She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating, their scales delicate flakes of jade, obsidian, and lapis lazuli. Slim towers stood taller than any Dany had ever seen, and elaborate fountains filled every square, wrought in the shapes of griffins and dragons and manticores. -ACOK, Daenerys IX

***

#Characters

**Rickon Stark**

Rickon (and Bran) dream of Ned:

&gt;Maester Luwin's turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything. Tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs, rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves, candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture, the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace door, star charts hung from the walls, shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes, papers, quills, and pots of inks were everywhere, and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters. Their strident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maester's wounds, under Luwin's terse instruction. ""This is folly,"" the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment. **""I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream, yet when you stop to consider it, it's only natural. You miss your lord father, and you know that he is a captive. Fear can fever a man's mind and give him queer thoughts. Rickon is too young to comprehend**—"" -AGOT, Bran VII

&gt;""They will be bigger still before they are grown,"" the young male said, watching them with eyes large, green, and unafraid. ""**The black one is full of fear and rage**, but the grey is strong . . . stronger than he knows . . . can you feel him, sister?"" -ACOK, Bran III

***

**Daenerys**

Dany sees the Red Door:

&gt;Wings shadowed her fever dreams.

&gt;""You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?""

&gt;She was walking down a long hall beneath high stone arches. She could not look behind her, must not look behind her. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it was painted red. She walked faster, and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone. -AGOT, Daenerys IX

**Jaime Lannister**

While it should be noted that his dream takes place on a weirwood stump, Jaime also has just lost his hand:

&gt;He could feel his phantom fingers clench. When Steelshanks said that perhaps they should have a fire and a bit of food, Jaime shook his head. ""I mislike this place. We'll ride on.""

&gt;By evenfall they had left the lake to follow a rutted track through a wood of oak and elm. Jaime's stump was throbbing dully when Steelshanks decided to make camp. **Qyburn had brought a skin of dreamwine**, thankfully. While Walton set the watches, Jaime stretched out near the fire and propped a rolled-up bearskin against a stump as a pillow for his head. The wench would have told him he had to eat before he slept, to keep his strength up, but he was more tired than hungry. He closed his eyes, and hoped to dream of Cersei. **The fever dreams were all so vivid . . .**

&gt;Naked and alone he stood, surrounded by enemies, with stone walls all around him pressing close. The Rock, he knew. He could feel the immense weight of it above his head. He was home. He was home and whole. -ASOS, Jaime VI

and:

&gt;Qyburn felt his brow. ""You still have a touch of fever.""

&gt;**""A fever dream.**"" Jaime reached up. ""Help me."" Steelshanks took him by his good hand and pulled him to his feet.

&gt;""Another cup of dreamwine?"" asked Qyburn. -ASOS, Jaime VI

***

**Arya Stark**

Arya may have dreamed of red wedding:

&gt;Evenfall found them still trudging toward the Green Fork and Lord Frey's twin castles. I am almost there, Arya thought. She knew she ought to be excited, but her belly was all knotted up tight. **Maybe that was just the fever she'd been fighting, but maybe not. Last night she'd had a bad dream, a terrible dream. She couldn't remember what she'd dreamed of now, but the feeling had lingered all day.** If anything, it had only gotten stronger. Fear cuts deeper than swords. She had to be strong now, the way her father told her. There was nothing between her and her mother but a castle gate, a river, and an army . . . but it was Robb's army, so there was no real danger there. Was there? -ASOS, Arya X

***

**Sansa Stark**

Maybe not a perfect fit, but I felt I needed to add it:

&gt;She had seldom ventured out on deck herself. **Her little cabin was dank and cold, but Sansa had been sick for most of the voyage . . . sick with terror, sick with fever, or seasick . . . she could keep nothing down, and even sleep came hard. Whenever she closed her eyes she saw Joffrey tearing at his collar, clawing at the soft skin of his throat, dying with flakes of pie crust on his lips and wine stains on his doublet. And the wind keening in the lines reminded her of the terrible thin sucking sound he'd made as he fought to draw in air. Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion as well.** ""He did nothing,"" she told Littlefinger once, when he paid a visit to her cabin to see if she were feeling any better. -ASOS, Sansa VI

***

**Brienne**

After her fight with Rorge/Biter:

&gt;The rain had stopped falling, but all the world was wet. Her cloak felt as heavy as her mail. The ropes that bound her wrists were soaked through, but that only made them tighter. No matter how Brienne turned her hands, she could not slip free. She did not understand who had bound her, or why. She tried to ask the shadows, but they did not answer. Perhaps they did not hear her. Perhaps they were not real. Under her layers of wet wool and rusting mail, her skin was flushed and feverish. **She wondered whether all of this was just a fever dream.**

and:

&gt;""I saw him. In the woods.""

&gt;**""A fever dream, my lady.""**

&gt;""He said that he would hang me. -AFFC, Brienne VIII

***

**Theon**

&gt;Theon Greyjoy opened his eyes. His shoulders were on fire and he could not move his hands. **For half a heartbeat he feared he was back in his old cell under the Dreadfort, that the jumble of memories inside his head was no more than the residue of some fever dream**. I was asleep, he realized. That, or passed out from the pain. When he tried to move, he swung from side to side, his back scraping against stone. He was hanging from a wall inside a tower, his wrists chained to a pair of rusted iron rings. -TWOW, Theon I

The only reason I call these 3 the big 3 is because their introductions are all very [repetitive](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/fveihm/repetition_of_wordingphrasing_by_grrm_spoilers/):

**Ned, Cersei and Varamyr**

***

Cersei's dream could occur because of fear, asphyxiation, etc: 

&gt;**She dreamt an old dream, of three girls in brown cloaks, a wattled crone, and a tent that smelled of death.** -AFFC, Cersei VIII

***

Varamyr has a fever dream afer being stabbed by a wildling child after Stannis broke Mance Rayder's forces:

&gt;**He dreamt an old dream of a hovel by the sea, three dogs whimpering, a woman's tears.** -ADWD, Prologue

***

I didn't feel the need to list out each of the actual visions, as we can discuss those in the comments if you like, but just wanted to point out all the dreams (and some that probably aren't exact fits as well).

I also feel like it is important to note that a lot of the info that may seem ""questionable"" due to it occurring in a fever dream is also confirmed outside the dream as well.

Then it struck me: I've always believed the show borrowed most of Euron's book arc to the Night King and left it at that, perhaps because there's a limit to the characters' similarity. And I still believe that. Euron is, at least for the time being, a human, while the Night King is a several thousand-years old undead. In addition, Euron is occupied south for the time being, and the Night king stays north for the entirety of the show. The similarities can only go so far, right?

Well, yes, but there might be more similarities than I've considered. And I think we can stretch the Euron = Night King similarities very, very far. Let's see *how* far.

This theory is gonna rest on the assumption that [Euron is a pupil of Bloodraven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbX_ak0N1EI). To save space, I won't repeat the arguments for that assumption here.

I've already mentioned both Euron and the Night King sending the Wall crashing down. The methods are different, and even their position, but on deeper level, it's basically the same thing (different optics, same outcome).

Yet couldn't it also be possible that Euron uses a dragon, just as the Night King did? It's not uncommon amongst the fandom to theorize that Euron steals a dragon at some point, so isn't plausible that he uses said dragon to crash the Wall? Sure, he might not ride it himself, but who says he has to?

Let's talk about Bran for a second. 

I've long found it weird how Bran never warged a dragon in S8. It seemed strange for the story to set up Bran to be such a powerful warg, but to restrict his abilities to, well, animals and Hodor. But what if *Euron* is the one doing the powerful warging? 

Like others, I've long suspected that Victarion's attempt to steal a dragon from Euron is bound to fail. The horn is bound to Euron, no matter what Victarion thinks. Therefore, it isn't unreasonable to theorize that, the minute Victarion's goons blow the dragon horn, one of the dragons is bound to Euron. Using a combination of warging and the Horn of Winter, Euron is able to send the dragon to the Wall, most likely while standing atop the Hightower (I don't think it's insignificant that people say you can see the Wall from said location). 

And then the Wall crashes!

A more interesting consequence of this theory comes from an iconic sequence from the ""Hold the Door"" episode. Everybody obviously remembers the Hodor part, but what about the part that precedes it, [that eery scene where Bran and the Night King interact in Bran's vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mr076-xwo4)?

I've always loved that scene. It's chillingly spooky, with Bran traversing amongst the Army of the Dead, no one of them being able to sense him ... except the Night King, who firmly grabs him, marks him, thereby enabling the attack on the cave that ultimately kills Hodor.

But what if, in the books, it is not the Night King Bran sees and is marked by, but rather Euron? After all, Euron entering other people's dreams is an established ability at this point. Aegon sees him in The Forsaken, and it's reasonable to assume it's him Daenerys dreams about in ADWD (""his lips were blue and bruised, and when he thrust himself inside her, his manhood was cold as ice"").

From a thematic standpoint, it's easy to argue that Euron is Dark Bran, the dark, failed pupil of Bloodraven. Since they occupy the same thematic space, it's not entirely unreasonable to imagine they'll occupy the dream *space* at the same time as well.

I could easily picture a scene in the books where Bran carelessly ventures into the dream space without Bloodraven's aid, before stumbling upon Euron. Perhaps Euron brands him in some way, thereby opening up the cave for an attack on the White Walkers that ends up killing Bloodraven and Hodor. Being a mentor figure, Bloodraven was always meant to die anyway, and being killed by Euron is perhaps the most obvious solution. It would probably be a very Obi-Wan vs. Darth Vader moment (""When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master"").

Just don't think expect Bran to escape in the Millennium Falcon. Hodor still dies, though.

After Bloodraven dies in the show, the Night King moves his sights to Bran next. This is made very clear in S8, where Bran explicitly calls out the two of them as arch enemies. In the show, the Night King's motivation is to kill all humanity, meaning he'll go for Bran first, seeing as Bran contains all of humanity.

Bran and Euron will most likely have some sort of staredown in the books as well, though time will tell if Euron makes it North. Some have speculated that Euron's role is to involve the south of Westeros into the Apocalypse, and while I'm very sympathetic to that argument, I could also see Euron heading North, just as the White Walkers begin to siege Winterfell. Seeing as Euron is not just a a foil for Bran, but also Daenerys, who is also headed North, there is a certain structural logic in Euron heading North at some point.

This would also explain why Euron might be so eager to send away the Ironborn fleet and sacrifice the rest; if he's planning on leading the Army of the Dead, he'll hardly need any Ironborn anyway. For him, they're cannon fodder, a means to reach Dany's dragons and the Hightower.

Whether or not an actual Night King becomes a book character, remains to be seen. I don't find it entirely implausible that the White Walkers have some kind of high lieutenant, yet I believe it's becoming increasingly clear that most, if not all we see of the Night King in the show will belong to Euron in the books. Seeing as Euron is probably supposed to be a modern-day *Night's* King (note the small difference), we also have an explanation why the showrunners semi-borrowed said character's name for the White Walker's leader.

One open question remains: will Euron do something similar to what the Night King does in the Beyond the Wall episode? It could be, especially because said episode is one of the few times where Dany and the Night King occupy the same space. But I think the context will be very different.

I mentioned above that Euron will steal a dragon when Victarion's goons blows the horn in Meereen. Yet it's possible that said act will only bind the dragon to Euron; it might still be too far away from him to obey it. But Dany is heading to Westeros, and that will mean that a dragon might be close enough for him. With Euron having already bound it to its will, warging into it or riding might be a piece of cake.

This can also explain how Dany makes it to the North in the books. In the show, Dany's decision to go North takes up most of S7, which I [don't think there's time for in the books](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gq7jez/theory_danys_s7_arc_is_borrowed_from_aegon/). I believe that most of what we see of Dany's arc in S7 belongs to Aegon, and that Dany will go North fairly early in ADOS or late in TWOW. This decision might be motivated by a call to arms from Jon Snow, yet there might also be a desire to take her dragon back, knowing what it would mean if it was lost forever. There are several possibilities.

It can also explain the scene where Bran sees a human being becoming the first White Walker in S6. While I think this could be the explanation for how the White Walkers were created in the books as well, it's possible the show used Euron's desire to transform from human to a God/Great Other to make a point about humans and others. Neither explanation is mutually exclusive with the other.

**Summary**

According to my theory, most of what we see of the Night King in the show is borrowed from Euron. This means we can expect something like the following to occur in the books:

* Euron sails for Oldtown, probably sacrificing the Ironborn in a massive blood ritual against the Redwyne fleet.
* Meanwhile, Victarion arrives in Meereen and tries to trick Euron by having himself be claimed the master of the Horn. However, it doesn't work, and one of the dragons is bound to Euron instead. Said dragon either flies west right or away, or stays with in Essos for the time being.
* Dany returns with the Dothraki in hand. If one dragon is missing, she probably decides to chase after it, eventually ending up in Westeros. If not, she might still sense that something is wrong with the dragon. I think the latter is more plausible, seeing as Dany has her plate full already, but both options are possible.
* Meanwhile, Bran has a one-on-one with Euron in the dream space, and Euron realizes Bloodraven has a new pupil. Euron marks Bran, which makes it possible for the White Walkers to attack Bloodraven, who dies. Bran escapes, but not without sacrificing Hodor.
* Sometime, Euron steals a dragon, and he uses it to send the Wall crashing down, either by warging it, or by riding it himself.
* Dany goes North to help Jon Snow and the rest. Either Euron is there already, or he shows up sometime later. Not impossible that he comes from the south, meaning Winterfell will be attacked from several angles (heightening the drama).

1081,"I was watching a documentary today about the 100 years war and it was the first time I'd heard about Louis XI, and several things immediately made me think about FAegon: 

* Louis was raised away from court among common folk, to protect him from a potential usurper to the French throne (Henry V of England)
   * Parallels to FAegon being raised with the common folk to protect him from the usurper Robert Baratheon
   * When he came to power, he replaced the nobles with common men. There are already hints that FAegon may do the same, such as naming Ser Rolly Duckfield to his Kingsguard
* Louis was described as being suspicious of everyone
   * Parallels to Tyrion telling FAegon to trust no one
* Louis' reign was threatened by Charles the Bold, who was killed in battle
   * There is much speculation about what side Barriston the Bold will take when he meets FAegon
* Louis was nicknamed ""The Universal Spider"" for his many intrigues and plots
   * FAegon is being groomed by Varys the Spider, famous for intrigues and plots

As with all historical references in ASOIAF, I don't think we can speculate on FAegon's future based on Louis' (and there are a lot of differences, such as Louis coming to the throne later in life) but it's fun to think that GRRM might have taken some inspiration from this historical figure, to whom I hadn't seen any references before.

1082,"Must it?

Why does anyone believe that?

What does it even mean?

I'm curious what people think. I generally get the impression that people think it means Daenerys will team up with two other fan-favourites, usually Jon and Tyrion, and ride dragons into battle against the Others. But that's three dragons with one (or two) heads each, not one with three heads.

Perhaps it's more ""head"" as in ""head of a river"", that is to say, ""source"", that is to say, the chosen one will be a child of three. But how would that work? (See [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ds0dru/mother_of_theories_jon_snow_daenerys_child_of/) for an attempt.)

It looks like a prophecy to me, or perhaps a dream. (Same thing.) But we're told again and again that dreams can lie, and prophecy is not to be trusted. And we're also told that prophecies can be sent, that is, implanted. (Whether through magic directly into the receptive mind, or simply through the magic of words, doesn't matter.)

I think it might be a prophecy sent to Targaryens by anti-Targaryen forces.

And I think this prophecy is what inspired Aegon I to marry both his sisters.

Are there any Targaryens prior who take multiple wives? I don't know that there are. Either Aegon the Conqueror was the first to receive the prophecy, or the first to interpret it in this way.

Either way: by marrying and procreating with both sisters, Aegon guaranteed a succession crisis and war after his death.

The prophecy seems to have caused another war, nearly 250 years later, when Rhaegar takes Lyanna. Those who've read *Fire and Blood* can probably point to more instances. Three heads are a millstone around the neck of the dragon.

1086,"I haven’t read the books since I was about 13, so my memory has dulled, and the tv show had warmed me up to Theon. 

This obviously isn’t a new take or anything, but I just *needed* somewhere to express my *deep* newly found hatred. 

It’s not even that he’s the worst character in the series, if that was true then I could stop sympathizing a little bit with him (and what’s to come). 

But no, Theon is cruel almost by default. He’s so overwhelmingly cruel- but it’s a callous almost disinterested cruelty that takes your breath away. It’s so casual, the way he says things. 

The first that comes to mind is the captains daughter when he says “The captain’s daughter had not been turned over for his use, but she had come to his bed willingly *enough*,”

How wretched is that- willingly *enough* it’s so disgustingly casual too that Theon never learns this girl’s *name*. He calls her *the girl* and it’s never a kind word, not once, he calls her fat, ugly, porridge faced, then ugly some more. It’s almost like it foreshadows his treatment of Kyra later on. Because it’s just *all downhill from here on out* 

Theon’s later repeated mantra of *you shouldn’t hate me, I could have done worse* is sickening. 

The real gut punch isn’t his utter ineptness, it’s that everything he does after taking Winterfell is *so unnecessary.* Its the worst combination of idiocy and cruelty. 

He takes a castle he cannot defend. 

He has Septon Charlie drowned 

He doesn’t post guards on the *two most valuable hostages* in Westeros 

He loses said hostages, and to cover it up Theon kills two children. He *kills* two *kids* who are around 4 and 10. I can barely even think the words. Then he has their heads cut off, flayed, and tarred. 

The fact that he killed the miller’s wife, his former lover, another *never named* while she *begs* for his help, feels almost like an afterthought. 

Kyra and Palla (I had a whole thing written up but I couldn’t properly express my rage) 

Because Theon *had* to do it, he had no choice because it’s better to be feared than thought a coward. Or let people believe you weak or that you made a mistake. (/s obviously) 

His POV is one unending pity party, that makes me regret empathizing/romanticizing his hopes to go home.

1087,"&gt; ""Wherever whores go,"" his father had said. **His last words, and what words they were.** The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. **He remembered none of it.** Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father's bowels opening. *Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.*

-- *ADWD*, Tyrion I

Tyrion then spends the rest of the book fixating on ""wherever whores go"", which has led to many fun hours wondering about the Sailor's Wife and Penny's mother and so on.

But this is actually another instance of unreliable narration. Let's look at the scene, not as Tyrion remembers it, but as it happened:

&gt; His father pursed his lips. ""There was no reason for that, she'd learned her place . . . and had been well paid for her day's work, I seem to recall. I suppose the steward sent her on her way. I never thought to inquire.""

&gt; ""On her way where?""

&gt; **""Wherever whores go.""**

&gt; Tyrion's finger clenched. The crossbow whanged just as Lord Tywin started to rise. The bolt slammed into him above the groin and he sat back down with a grunt. The quarrel had sunk deep, right to the fletching. Blood seeped out around the shaft, dripping down into his pubic hair and over his bare thighs. **""You shot me,""** he said incredulously, his eyes glassy with shock.

&gt; ""You always were quick to grasp a situation, my lord,"" Tyrion said. ""That must be why you're the Hand of the King.""

&gt; **""You . . . you are no . . . no son of mine.""**

&gt; ""Now that's where you're wrong, Father. Why, I believe I'm you writ small. Do me a kindness now, and die quickly. I have a ship to catch.""

&gt; For once, his father did what Tyrion asked him. The proof was the sudden stench, as his bowels loosened in the moment of death. Well, he was in the right place for it, Tyrion thought. But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was just another lie.

&gt; Lord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold.

-- *ASOS*, Tyrion XI

Go back and read the first quote, [and other remembrances](https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=wherever+whores+go). Notice that, contrary to what he thinks, Tyrion actually remembers almost all of it. Every detail of the scene is correct in his memory: ""Wherever whores go,"" Tywin rising, the sound of the crossbow, Tywin sitting back down, Tywin dropping a dookie.

The only things missing are the words exchanged after ""Wherever whores go,"" which Tyrion misremembers as Tywin's last words. But Tywin speaks twice after ""Wherever whores go,"" and his actual last words are ""You are no son of mine.""

I propose that there are two reasons ""Wherever whores go"" [displaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_%28psychology%29) ""You are no son of mine."" The first is that, even after everything that's gone between them, Tyrion still can't bear the thought that might not be Tywin's son. (This is one reason his chapters are always titled ""Tyrion"", even when he's going under an assumed name, unlike with Arya. He still hasn't escaped his father's shadow.) The second is that it would rather give the game away if Tyrion spent an entire book remember Tywin's actual last words without wondering what he meant.

------------------------------------

Minor thoughts:

Is it possible to read the scene such that Tywin rises in reaction to Tyrion's pulling of the trigger? This would mean that Tyrion [protesteth too much here](https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=He+was+rising+when+I+killed+him.&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion), and goes some way to explaining why he feels so guilty.

Tywin's last words don't logically connect to Tyrion's preceding line. He doesn't call him father, for instance. Whatever he meant by it, ""You are no son of mine"" must be something that Tywin thought it important to say before he died.

""*Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.*"" This is truer than Tyrion is willing to admit.",asoiaf,"[spoilers extended] ""Wherever whores go"" as misdirection"

1094,"This question has probably been asked before and I missed it, since I haven't been active much on various A Song of Ice and Fire forums since around 2014 or 2015, but here goes.

Why in the *world* is Young Griff's hair silver? Why would he have Targaryen features?

Back when I was active on the forums, I read a lot of theories about him being fake, and they tended to use references to visions and imagery to defend them, which I found unconvincing. But a couple days ago, I randomly thought about fAegon's natural hair colour, and it just didn't make any sense to me.

As far as I'm aware, Targaryen traits are always recessive in every single instance where they didn't inter-marry. As far as I'm aware, even Rhaenys, Aegon's sister, has always been depicted with Martell features. Why in the world would Varys and Illyrio pick a random boy, probably one from Lys, and have him pretend to be a Targaryen, when anyone with at least half a brain in Westeros who questions the veracity of his claims about his lineage, will immediately realize that the boy is supposed to have Dornish features? Why would they choose to do it this way?

Because of this detail, I am now convinced that this is not the real Aegon. Most likely, he's not even related to the Targaryen at all, unless the claims of some other people that fAegon is actually a Blackfyre descendant are true.

Anyways, I was just wondering what people here thought about the whole thing.",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Published) About the ""fAegon"" Theory"
1095,"&gt;I've always agreed with William Faulkner—he said that the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about. I've always taken that as my guiding principle, and the rest is just set dressing. - George RR Martin.

 **The Post was removed, so reposting for the record.** 

There are a lot of characters whose hearts are in conflict with themselves. Here, I primarily want to focus on Doran.

If you are like me and read and re-read the books 5 or 6 times, you might have figured out Illyrio's and Doran's schemes and their presence in almost all events in Westeros and Essos except few places like North, Vale, Braavos, Qarth.

How do a character like Doran will have a conflict with himself? the answer might be Aegon the son of Rhaegar and Elia, the last memory of Doran's beloved sister.

Doran is a major player in the game of thrones and his endgame is very groundbreaking. He wants,

1. The Iron throne to implement Dornish law.
2. Equality in seven kingdoms.
3. Restore Rhoynar culture.
4. The utter destruction of House Lannister.

These are tall orders. Doran's major opponent is Illyrio, who wants to keep Westeros in Absolute Monarchy. I still haven't done an in-depth analysis of Illyrio's master plan. Does Martin want us to take that Illyrio wants to bring back Absolute Monarchy to Essos? Tyrion mentioned that there is no difference between Common Born in Westeros and Slave in Essos and Martin made it clear in the story of Slavery that it has become a major problem in Pentos, with Braavos growing power.

Aegon represents The Andal's Patriarchy which stands in direct opposition to Rhoynar's **Egalitarianism.**

Fake Aegon doesn't fit the story has it open a paradox that why didn't Marwyn use his glass candle to find out about Aegon and Inform Doran, Doran has numerous connection across free cities to eliminate a potential threat to his master plan.

If Aegon is really Elia's Son, then Doran will have a conflict with himself.

If Aegon is losing and about to die, Doran cannot abandon Aegon for his own ambition but If Aegon is winning then Doran's years of careful planning to restore Rhoynar and replace feudalism with Egalitarianism will break down.

Aegon has to be the real son of Elia in A song of ice and fire to make sense of his existence in the story.

I like to add the following to strengthen my point.

The Hints which martin gave us in books that say Aegon is fake are questionable.

The Black Dragon rusted into Red, fits Golden Company more than Young Griff as GC were initially Blackfyre supports then over the years lost their identity and became sellsword who are hired by Targaryen Supports.

Sun's Son and Mummer's Dragon may implicate Quentyn and Aegon respectively at face value but this one from the book says otherwise

&gt;**There were two seats on the dais**, near twin to one another, save that one had the **Martell spear inlaid in gold** upon its back, whilst the **other bore the blazing Rhoynish sun** that had flown from the masts of Nymeria’s ships when first they came to Dorne. The **captain placed the prince beneath the spear** and stepped away.

1. Mummer's Dragon fits Quentyn better than Aegon because Quentyn is the one who shows fake loyalty to Dany to get the dragons and claims that he can control dragon because he had one Targaryen ancestor.
2. The Sun's Son in the vision fits Aegon perfectly because Aegon is the son of Elia who represents the sun of house martel or Doran because he is the son of Princess of Dorne.

Some may point out Illyrio's conversation with Tyrion proves Aegon is fake, for that, I would say does it. Tyrion is clever but not that good in the game of throne, if he was he wouldn't let himself be accused of regicide and kick out of court with no allies or friend to save or support him.

The whole situation of Dany's turn and the outcry from fans that resulted from it reminded me of another story with a character named Illidan from World of Warcraft. Who went for a morally grey complex character to utter madman in the space of a second with almost no development besides other people saying he just went mad because that is his nature i.e, telling not showing.

It took around 8-9 years but eventually, a short novel was released that went into detail and retconned/changed some aspects to make it more believable and natural. I think this would be a perfect way to fix Dany's arc. Kinda like Anakins turn being better explained and developt through an anime show.

But obviously this would only be done if such anime show or some sort of sequel was in the works to make more money otherwise I doubt anyone at HBO would bother if it doesn't involve high profit.

Although for the prequel that is coming up giving the most famous Targ a better developt story would undo the whole why bother watching a show about the Targs when their story ends up so badly written opinion some may have and it will buy some good will from the fandom.

1102,"Here is another passage that has always stood out to me:

&gt;""He must have crawled away from the others,"" Jon said.

&gt;""Or been driven away,"" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.

&gt;""An albino,"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ""This one will die even faster than the others."" -AGOT, Bran I

Obviously there are some pretty straightforward explanations, but also some wording that is just begging to be theorized about.

**Lets discuss, theorize about a very early Bran quote**

***

While discussing anything from AGOT (written in 1996) its important to remember (at least to me) that there are plenty of ""first bookisms"" or things that it seems GRRM ended up abandoning.

Let's get to the quote:

#Standard Interpretation

While reading the quote in the context that the rest of the chapter:

&gt;You have five trueborn children,"" Jon said. ""Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.""

Bran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.

&gt;Their father understood as well. ""You want no pup for yourself, Jon?"" he asked softly.

&gt;""The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,"" Jon pointed out. ""I am no Stark, Father."" -AGOT, Bran I

And combine it with other quotes like this:

&gt;He dreamt he was back in Winterfell, limping past the stone kings on their thrones. Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed, and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps. You are no Stark, he could hear them mutter, in heavy granite voices. There is no place for you here. Go away. He walked deeper into the darkness. ""Father?"" he called. ""Bran? Rickon?"" No one answered. A chill wind was blowing on his neck. ""Uncle?"" he called. ""Uncle Benjen? Father? Please, Father, help me."" Up above he heard drums. **They are feasting in the Great Hall, but I am not welcome there. I am no Stark, and this is not my place.** His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees. The crypts were growing darker. A light has gone out somewhere. ""Ygritte?"" he whispered. ""Forgive me. Please."" But it was only a direwolf, grey and ghastly, spotted with blood, his golden eyes shining sadly through the dark . -ASOS, Jon VIII

and this:

&gt;Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man. On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive. You're no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you. **He'd heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children**; on the Wall, you grew up or you died. -AGOT, Bran VI

***

#Bloodraven/The Others

This quote is just full of imagery wrt to Bloodraven and the Others

&gt;""He must have crawled away from the others,"" Jon said.

&gt;""Or been driven away,"" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.

&gt;""An albino,"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ""This one will die even faster than the others."" -AGOT, Bran I

The amount of theorizing you can do with the above quote knowing that:

- Bloodraven (who has a ton of [parallels](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/czrdy0/bloodraven_vs_the_nights_king_a_comparison/) to Night's King) disappeared on ranging in 252 AAC:

&gt;Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in 239 AC, serving until his disappearance during a ranging beyond the Wall in 252 AC. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

- Bran's story [seems to be headed down a pretty dark path](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/duuwgu/small_connection_between_bran_and_darknessthe/) and it could get worse if he breaks the third ""rule"" of the [""Skinchanger's Code""](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b83h6o/consequences_to_bran_breaking_the_skinchangers/)

- GRRM originally had [Bran and Jon becoming bitter enemies](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cwqi0b/bran_vs_jon_bitter_enemies_spoilers_extended/)

- Its possible or even likely that Bloodraven was the one who directed the mother direwolf south of the wall and to the Starks (Bloodraven intervenes in Jon's story almost as much as Bran's) and the above thoughts about Bloodraven are even more likely if you believe this.

- Like Jon, Bloodraven is a ""song of ice and fire"". Both of their fathers were Targaryen princes/kings and both of their mothers were from ""northern"" houses (houses that worship the old gods). 

- As of now Bloodraven's intentions are still ambiguous. 

- Jon's choice of name/Ghost being silent:

&gt;Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. ""A very quiet wolf,"" he observed.

&gt;""He's not like the others,"" Jon said. ""He never makes a sound. That's why I named him Ghost. That, and because he's white. The others are all dark, grey or black."" -AGOT, Jon I

***

Also keep in mind a portion of this quote is in the comic adaption (and  there is a quote from the beginning of AGOT, that GRRM told Abrams to put back in that had some meaning at the end).

1107,"In ADWD,  when Melisandre looks into the flames, she sees a “wooden face, corpse white” with a thousand red eyes, accompanied by a boy with a wolf’s face. She assumes that they are servants of the Great Other.

&gt;A face took shape within the hearth. **Stannis?** she thought, for just a moment … but no, these were not his features. **A wooden face, corpse white**. Was this the enemy? A thousand red eyes floated in the rising flames. **He sees me**. Beside him, a boy with a wolf’s face threw back his head and howled.  
&gt;  
&gt;The wooden man she had glimpsed, though, and the boy with the wolf's face ... they were his servants, surely ... his champions, as Stannis was hers.

I've seen many point out that the two people she sees are Brynden and Bran, and they most likely are. But i can't help but feel there's a trick here. 

While people assume she's wrong on seeing them as enemies, could it be she sees the truth? There are many theories concerning Bloodraven and his loyalties, that he is not what he seems. Considering that he is on the Great Other's side, it would mean that he could indeed be its champion, and that Mel was right. 

Bran on the other hand... Its unlikely he would be its servant. I don't think he'd be against the living. Which is why i think the ""boy"" mentioned is actually Arya. 

She has been on her journey of hatred and death for a while now, and there are theories concerning her grim future. How she's the Stranger, to bring death to Westeros. We also know she has been looked on as a boy before... Could it be Mel was correct?

However, with everything that transpired shouldn't have Ned arranged a marriage for Robb to help the future of House Stark.

1123,"Of all the regions or kingdoms of Westeros that became part of the Seven Kingdoms from the cold North to the arid Dorne, which region/kingdom has in your opinion the most interesting internal politics ?

The Riverlands for sure have very tumultuous and unstable internal politics due to the lack of defenses and unity of the region, with House Tully having to rule over many houses that are often more powerful, prestigious or richer than them and with many houses being of dubious loyalty. The lack of geographical defenses and countless invasion of the region by the other regions of Westeros only spice things up.

&amp;#x200B;

The Reach has also fascinating internal affairs due to each house being in theory descendants of Garth Greenhand and of House Gardener which means that many of the houses have a claim to rule over the Reach, causing many tensions, rivalries and internal conflicts within the region.  Due to this House Tyrell have often problems controlling and ruling their vassals and countrymen and it's interesting to see what means they use to keep the region under their control with them investing in Oldtown for example by leading and providing the city watch to the Hightowers, and likely by having a direct influence on and spies within the Citadel and on the order of Maesters.

The North is also quite interesting due to it being basically a federation of various people such as the usual northmen descended of the First Men, the Moutain clans, the Crannogmen, the Skagosi and some people of Andal origins like House Manderly.  House Stark's unique way of ruling the North, the  northerners' unique loyalty to the Starks but also the presence of its own internal rivalries such as the ones between House Stark and House Bolton, between the Boltons and the Umbers and the Manderlys make it a far more complex region to rule that it looks like.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Which region of Westeros has the most interesting internal politics ?

1126,"So with House Stark currently in exile and without any armies and scattered it is going to take other Lords of the North to rally, remove the Boltons from Power (Extinction) and put a Stark back in Winterfell. And this is whether or not it is Jon as the only member of House Stark even a Bastard who is known to be alive or Rickon with either Jon acting Regent or someone else Co-Ruling the North until Rickon is of age.

So, this got me thinking what Houses in the North are still vastly loyal to the Starks even with their situation. You have the Manderleys who I would say are the most loyal due to The North Remembers plot by Lord Manderley.  And this stems even further back from sending Ser Davos to retrieve Rickon their liege Lord despite the fact he's only what 3/4. This goes back to when House Stark saved them when they were in dire need and exiled from the Reach. They haven't forgotten and never will which is why as soon as Lord Manderley found out about Rickon then he made his plan to side with Stannis and get his revenge for the Red Wedding.

You then have House Umber, very loyal vassals supposed to be the most Loyal Vassal to the Starks but with Great Jon imprisoned they have to be careful and then it seems their House is split with sticking with the Boltons and with the Stark sentiment still there. Bran didn't even send Rickon there for protection as he wasn't sure whether they were entirely loyal with the state the North was in due to the War of the 5 Kings. 

House Mormont are definitely up there due to the We Know No King but the King in the North who is a Stark to Stannis. Ballsy and quiet loyal. Only thing is there military strength isn't enough to help House Stark and with them being on an island it isn't worth the Boltons time to do something drastic. 

House Glover, a loyal House but with the Ironborn Invasion of the North and no help coming from the Starks you could understand why they wouldn't be entirely loyal. Yes there was a war going on still but with the Starks being the Royal Family of the North, Robb should have sent troops sooner.

House Cerwyn, I would say loyal but too frightened to do anything to help the Starks take back the North due to Ramsey. And for that reason I would say not as loyal as they could be.

House Karstark, their loyalty was finished when Robb beheaded Rickard Karstark and with his 2 sons dying in the war in vain you can't be surprised. And with the rightful Lord imprisoned and his family making sure he gets killed by faking to be with Stannis then maybe they could be brought back into the fold through Jons action with Alys if the imprisoned Karstark Lord makes it home to Karhold.

House Hornwood, survivors of the Hornwood army are with Stannis and only Laurence Snow a bastard is the last of the line of Hornwoods so they have little influence but would say still loyal to the Starks.

The Flints, Wulls and Mountain Clans willing to join Stannis to save Arya so would say still very loyal to the Starks. 

House Magnor and Skagosi is still unknown where their loyalties lie and what happens with Rickon will show where their loyalties lie in Winds of Winter.

And House Reed, Ned and Howland were very close friends however we have no indication of whats happening with them after the Starks were scattered and exiled from Power. Maybe they are waiting for the right moment and have Lord Glover and Maege Mormont of Bear Island. But only time will tell.

So from this I do believe that the Most Loyal House to the Starks has to be the Manderleys.

Drunk, Theon decided, watching him bellow. It was said that the ironmen of old had oft been blood-drunk in battle, so berserk that they felt no pain and feared no foe, but this was a common ale-drunk.""Wex, my bow and quiver."" The boy ran and fetched them. Theon bent the bow and slipped the string into its notches as Todric knocked down the Botley boy and flung ale into his eyes. Fishwhiskers leapt up cursing, but Theon was quicker. He drew on the hand that clutched the drinking horn, figuring to give them a shot to talk about, but Todric spoiled it by lurching to one side just as he loosed. The arrow took him through the belly.

Theon kills here out of insecurity. Wanting to demonstrate his control over his own men, he winds up killing one of them for a minor offence – which normally would alienate men from their leader, lucikly these men are ironborn.

&gt; The looters stopped to gape. Theon lowered his bow. ""No drunkards, I said, and no squabbles over plunder."" On his knees, Todric was dying noisily. ""Botley, silence him."" Fishwhiskers and his sons were quick to obey. They slit Todric's throat as he kicked feebly, and were stripping him of cloak and rings and weapons before he was even dead.Now they know I mean what I say. Lord Balon might have given him the command, but Theon knew that some of his men saw only a soft boy from the green lands when they looked at him. ""Anyone else have a thirst?"" No one replied. ""Good."" 


He talks about being a good lord over beating peasants at winterfell his men raped and abused.



&gt; ”You’ll tell them how you’ve yielded Winterfell to me, and command them to serve and obey their new lords as they did the old…”Theon ignored the outburst. “My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock, and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the north as well, by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.”“Bugger that.” Mikken wiped the blood from his mouth. “I serve the Starks, not some treasonous squid of—aah.” The butt of the spear smashed him face first into the stone floor.“Smiths have strong arms and weak heads,” observed Theon. “But if the rest of you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, you’ll find me as generous a lord as you could want.”On his hands and knees, Mikken spat blood. Please don’t, Bran wished at him, but the blacksmith shouted, “If you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o’—”…“I will be as good a lord to you as Eddard Stark ever was.” Theon raised his voice to be heard above the smack of wood on flesh. “Betray me, though, and you’ll wish you hadn’t.”

Normally this would be hypocritical but Theon has problems seeing peasants as people.

Then once he summons his new subjects after the starks escape well.

&gt; Outside he heard sobbing as the castle folk were pulled from their beds and driven into the yard. I’ll give them reason to sob. I’ve used them gently, and this is how they repay me. He’d even had two of his own men whipped bloody for raping that kennel girl, to show them he meant to be just. They still blame me for the rape, though. And the rest. He deemed that unfair. Mikken had killed himself with his mouth, just as Benfred had. As for Chayle, he had to give someone to the Drowned God, his men expected it. “I bear you no ill will,” he’d told the septon before they threw him down the well, “but you and your gods have no place here now.” You’d think the others might be grateful he hadn’t chosen one of them, but no. He wondered how many of them were part of this plot against him…


&gt; To help hunt down and likely kill a a crriple ten year and 3 three year old boy he has to use  some of the most odious tactics imaginable to secure the minimum level of support.…”Farlen, I’ll want hounds, and you to handle them.”The grizzled kennelmaster crossed his arms. “And why would I care to hunt down my own trueborn lords, and babes at that?”Theon moved close. “I am your trueborn lord now, and the man who keeps Palla safe.”He saw the defiance die in Farlen’s eyes. “Aye, m’lord.”


Now while Theon may be a cruel,insecure man who kills as soon he blinks or feels insecure he rallies his men to fight against over 2,000 northmen.


&gt; “They made a pitifully small assembly; the ironmen were few, the yard large. “The northmen will be on us before nightfall,” he told them. “Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call. I will not run from them. I took this castle and I mean to hold it, to live or die as Prince of Winterfell. But I will not command any man to die with me. If you leave now, before Ser Rodrik’s main force is upon us, there’s still a chance you may win free.” He unsheathed his longsword and drew a line in the dirt. “Those who would stay and fight, step forward.”“No one spoke. The men stood in their mail and fur and boiled leather, as still as if they were made of stone. A few exchanged looks. Urzen shuffled his feet. Dykk Harlaw hawked and spat. A finger of wind ruffled Endehar’s long fair hair.”“Theon felt as though he were drowning. Why am I surprised? he thought bleakly. His father had forsaken him, his uncles, his sister, even that wretched creature Reek. Why should his men prove any more loyal? There was nothing to say, nothing to do. He could only stand there beneath the great grey walls and the hard white sky, sword in hand, waiting, waiting…”“Wex was the first to cross the line. Three quick steps and he stood at Theon’s side, slouching. Shamed by the boy, Black Lorren followed, all scowls. “Who else?” he demanded. Red Rolfe came forward. Kromm. Werlag. Tymor and his brothers. Ulf the Ill. Harrag Sheepstealer. Four Harlaws and two Botleys. Kenned the Whale was the last. Seventeen in all.”

Granted it's unclear if it's due to Theon's charisma or the fact that most ironborn believe paradise awaits in the afterlife and the quest for glory. I feel the show missed out on that that the Ironborn are surprisingly loyal, or at least they don't view other non ironborn as anything less than subhuman and would rather die than admit it.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Theon and his crew

I’m just wondering how they could possibly meet in the books (assuming job comes back), as if I was Jon, I would want to kill her.

1147,"&gt; The girl with the golden curls put her hands upon her hips. ""Give us our foretelling, or I'll go to my lord father and have you whipped for insolence.""

&gt; ""Please,"" begged Melara. ""Just tell us our futures, then we'll go.""

&gt; ""Some are here who have no futures,"" Maggy muttered in her terrible deep voice. She pulled her robe about her shoulders and beckoned the girls closer. ""Come, if you will not go. Fools. Come, yes. I must taste your blood.""

&gt; Melara paled, but not Cersei. A lioness does not fear a frog, no matter how old and ugly she might be. She should have gone, she should have listened, she should have run away. Instead she took the dagger Maggy offered her, and ran the twisted iron blade across the ball of her thumb. Then she did Melara too.

&gt; In the dim green tent, the blood seemed more black than red. Maggy's toothless mouth trembled at the sight of it. ""Here,"" she whispered, ""give it here."" When Cersei offered her hand, she sucked away the blood with gums as soft as a newborn babe's. The queen could still remember how queer and cold her mouth had been.

&gt; ""Three questions may you ask,"" the crone said, once she'd had her drink. ""You will not like my answers. Ask, or begone with you.""

&gt; *Go*, the dreaming queen thought, *hold your tongue, and flee*. But the girl did not have sense enough to be afraid.

&gt; ""When will I wed the prince?"" she asked.

&gt; ""Never. You will wed the king.""

&gt; Beneath her golden curls, the girl's face wrinkled up in puzzlement. For years after, she took those words to mean that she would not marry Rhaegar until after his father Aerys had died. ""I will be queen, though?"" asked the younger her.

&gt; ""Aye."" Malice gleamed in Maggy's yellow eyes. ""Queen you shall be . . . until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.""

&gt; Anger flashed across the child's face. ""If she tries I will have my brother kill her."" Even then she would not stop, willful child as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse into her life to come. ""Will the king and I have children?"" she asked.

&gt; ""Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you.""

&gt; That made no sense to Cersei. Her thumb was throbbing where she'd cut it, and her blood was dripping on the carpet. *How could that be?* she wanted to ask, but she was done with her questions.

&gt; The old woman was not done with her, however. ""Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds,"" she said. ""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; ""What is a valonqar? Some monster?"" The golden girl did not like that foretelling. ""You're a liar and a warty frog and a smelly old savage, and I don't believe a word of what you say. Come away, Melara. She is not worth hearing.""

&gt; ""I get three questions too,"" her friend insisted. And when Cersei tugged upon her arm, she wriggled free and turned back to the crone. ""Will I marry Jaime?"" she blurted out.

&gt; *You stupid girl*, the queen thought, angry even now. *Jaime does not even know you are alive*. Back then her brother lived only for swords and dogs and horses . . . and for her, his twin.

&gt; ""Not Jaime, nor any other man,"" said Maggy. ""Worms will have your maidenhead. Your death is here tonight, little one. Can you smell her breath? She is very close.""

&gt; ""The only breath we smell is yours,"" said Cersei. There was a jar of some thick potion by her elbow, sitting on a table. She snatched it up and threw it into the old woman's eyes. In life the crone had screamed at them in some queer foreign tongue, and cursed them as they fled her tent. But in the dream her face dissolved, melting away into ribbons of grey mist until all that remained were two squinting yellow eyes, the eyes of death.

-- *AFFC*, Cersei VIII

People generally take this prophecy as having already come true, and spend a lot of time wondering just who it is who's going to strangle Cersei to death. Today I'd like to point out just how little of it is definitively true.

The general point to bear in mind is that prophecy is a load of old bollocks. It's easy to make predictions. If one later comes true, congratulations, you are a prophet. If it doesn't come true, no-one will remember. And if they do, and they criticise you, you just say, well, it's hard to predict the future, what did you expect? Unless they're the sort of person who believes in prophecy, in which case they'll tie themselves in knots convincing themselves that what you said did in fact come true.

This is a point GRRM has made himself:

&gt; ""Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star. I know the prophecy."" Marwyn turned his head and spat a gob of red phlegm onto the floor. ""Not that I would trust it. Gorghan of Old Ghis once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is . . . and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams. That is the nature of prophecy, said Gorghan. Prophecy will bite your prick off every time."" He chewed a bit. ""Still . . .""

-- *AFFC*, Samwell V

(Note that ""Still..."" - one suspects Marwyn is tempted, against his better judgement, to stick his cock into her maw. As we all would be, right, lads? HIYOOOOOOO)

GRRM makes the point more explicitly still:

&gt; [Prophecy is one](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2000/09) of those tropes of Fantasy that is fun to play with, but it can easily turn into a straightjacket if you're not careful. One of the themes of my fiction, since the very beginning, is that the characters must make their choices, for good or ill. And making choices is hard. There are prophecies in my Seven Kingdoms, but their meanings are often murky and misleading, and they seldom offer the characters much in the way of useful guidance.

And:

&gt; [Prophecies are, you know,](http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html?spref=tw) a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you don’t want to be too literal or too easy... In the Wars of the Roses, that you mentioned, there was one Lord who had been prophesied he would die beneath the walls of a certain castle and he was superstitious at that sort of walls, so he never came anyway near that castle. He stayed thousands of leagues away from that particular castle because of the prophecy. However, he was killed in the first battle of St. Paul de Vence and when they found him dead he was outside of an inn whose sign was the picture of that castle! [Laughs] So you know? That’s the way prophecies come true in unexpected ways. **The more you try to avoid them, the more you are making them true, and I make a little fun with that.**

When it comes to Maggy the Frog's prophecy, then, the important point to bear in mind it's that (a) it's not very accurate, and (b) to the extent that it is accurate, that doesn't mean Maggy actually predicted anything.

--------------------------------------------

Maggy makes 11 distinct factual claims:

* One or more people in the tent have no future
* Cersei will never marry the prince
* Cersei will marry the king
* Cersei will be queen
* There will come ""another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear""
* The king will have 16 children
* Cersei will have 3 children
* The children will wear golden crowns and golden shrouds
* Her tears will drown her
* ""The valonqar"" will strangle her
* Melara will never marry because she'll be murdered by one of the in the tent

(We can split hairs over how distinct those things are later. For now, let's go with it, for the sake of argument.)

The following things have unambigiously come true:

* Cersei will be queen
* Cersei will have 3 children
* Melara will never marry because she'll be murdered by someone in the tent

The following things are ambiguous:

* One or more people in the tent have no future
* Cersei will never marry the prince
* Cersei will marry the king
* The king will have 16 children

The following things have definitely not happened:

* There will come ""another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear""
* The children will wear golden crowns and golden shrouds
* Her tears will drown her
* ""The valonqar"" will strangle her

So we see Maggy is right between 27% and 64% of the time.

Some of you might argue she got Joffrey's death right, and that therefore we should treat the deaths and crownings of each child as distinct factual claims.

Okay: that makes 16 claims in total, 6 true, 4 maybe, 6 false, leaving her right between 38% and 63% of the time.

I am now going to poke holes in every single prediction and show that even the ones that came true are unimpressive and do not augur predictive ability on Maggy's part.

One caveat: doubtless there will be complaints about my splitting hairs and playing silly buggers with the precise wording. But that's precisely my point: you have to do that to find these prophecies accurate. And anyway, prophets and genies taking you at your literal word and using miscommunication to fuck with you is traditional. That's what they do. We shouldn't think it impossible that Maggy would do the same, especially when she's clearly ticked off with Cersei and ""malicious"".

-------------------------------------------

**One or more people in the tent have no future**

This is generally taken as a duplicate of the prediction that Melara will be murdered, and perhaps it should be. (Note that, if this is the case, it brings Maggy's accuracy down even further.) But look at what Maggy actually says: ""Some are here who have no futures"". Note the plural. How does that make sense as a prediction of merely Melara's death?

It's not even 100% clear that Maggy is talking about death at all. Perhaps she means that some in the tent are going nowhere in life.

More pertinently, she could be referring to her own death. Melisandre says one of the easiest things to predict is a threat to your own life, and Jojen seems to know exactly when he's going to die. [The wiki](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maggy_the_Frog) has Maggy dying in 276, although they give no source. But this is the same year Cersei visited her.

As for Melara's murder, I will return to it later.

------------------------------------------------

**Cersei will never marry the prince**

If ""the prince"" is Rhaegar, then this comes true, unless Rhaegar's still alive. Cersei is *definitely* still alive, however, and could still end up marrying a prince. (She nearly got married off to Oberyn, for instance.)

You may say, ""but Cersei asked about marrying *'the'* prince, and we know she meant Rhaegar."" Even assuming Maggy isn't maliciously exploiting Cersei's ambiguity, we still run into trouble if we assume that the prince Maggy's talking about is the one Cersei's thinking of. (See the next point.)

------------------------------------------------

**Cersei will marry the king**

Which king?

The king at the time of this prediction was Aerys, so the prediction would therefore be false.

Cersei later came to interpret this as referring to Rhaegar, which also ended up false.

You can say, ""Ah, but Robert was the king, so it was fine."" Sure, but Cersei would've had no way of knowing that, so we have Maggy eliding from ""the prince"" Cersei was referring to to ""the king"" she didn't even know about. It's inconsistent.

Plus, this is not actually a prediction that requires magic powers: any savvy Westerosi politico could've made such a guess. Tywin is famously ambitious, and has told Cersei years before that he intends to wed her to Rhaegar. This visit takes place during [a tourney Tywin throws](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister#Attempted_betrothal_to_Rhaegar_Targaryen), at the end of which, Cersei is to be betrothed to Rhaegar. But Aerys turns him down.

If Maggy the Frog is aware of this, then ""You will marry the king"" is a guess that stands a good chance of coming true: the ruthless amoral Tywin wants his daughter to be queen, and his relationship with Aerys is already strained. If Aerys says no, Tywin may well find someone else.

(Which, I think he does: he tries to get Aerys killed at Duskendale so Rhaegar can take over; he sinks Steffon Baratheon's ship rather than let him return with an alternative bride for Rhaegar; using the Kingswood Brotherhood, he tries to have Elia Martell assassinated rather than let her wed Rhaegar; and once Rhaegar is wed, he abandons the Targaryen, throws the Rebellion Robert's way, and gets Cersei married to Robert instead. I realise this is mostly conjecture, but it's also probably correct. Either way, point is, you don't need magic powers: you can read the political winds, not the tea leaves, for this one.)

------------------------------------------------

**Cersei will be queen**

Ditto. I suppose I should've considered this a single claim with the previous one. That's the average lowered again!

------------------------------------------------

**There will come ""another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear""**

This has not come true, not even a little bit.

""But Margaery!"" But nothing: Margaery has done nothing to Cersei. Of course, she may well do something against her now that Cersei's had her framed for treason. But whose fault is that? Margaery's vengeance, should it come, is entirely Cersei's fault: Cersei attacked Margaery, for no reason other than that she feared her, and she only feared her because of the prophecy. If she'd simply ignored the prophecy, she'd have no enemy in Margaery. The prophecy only appears to come true here, but really, the agency is entirely Cersei's.

""But Brienne is 'the beautiful'!"" That's as may be, but Brienne has done nothing to Cersei.

""But Daenerys will burn King's Landing!"" Maybe, but since the circumstances in the books will likely be wholly different than in the show - we hope - we cannot consider this confirmed either. Maybe Cersei brings this one on herself, too, or maybe it doesn't happen at all. We don't know.

------------------------------------------------

**The king will have 16 children**

We have no idea whether this is true or not. In fact, so far as we know, it isn't. I believe the count of known children for Robert is at 8. *And*, as mentioned, we don't know what king she's talking about at all. Plus, if Maggy were being misleading, she might not even be talking about the king that Cersei is ""going"" to marry.

------------------------------------------------

**Cersei will have 3 children**

This one comes true - but only because of actions that Cersei takes:

&gt; ""...Robert got me with child once,"" she said, her voice thick with contempt. ""My brother found a woman to cleanse me. He never knew.""

-- *AGOT*, Eddard XII

If Cersei hadn't done that, she'd have had four kids, and the prophecy would be proved false.

Now, fair enough, this isn't nessarily something she did because of the prophecy; on the other hand, it might be. If she believes she'll only ever have three children, and she hates Robert, then she can't afford to waste a pregnancy on one of his offspring.

Either way, she once again made a prediction come true through her own actions.

------------------------------------------------

**The children will wear golden crowns and golden shrouds**

Joffrey and Tommen have both worn a golden crown, and Joffrey has died.

But there's no mention of a golden shroud for Joffrey. If it's a metaphor, then what it's a metaphor for? ""Shroud"" signifies death, but why is it a ""gold"" shroud?

Meanwhile, Myrcella and Tommen are both still alive, and Myrcella's never worn a crown.

""But the TV show!...""

...is complete garbage, to be ignored - and even if we don't, we see that, in the show, the deaths of her children are the consequences of her own actions once again.

It's easy to see ways this prediction could come true, but until one of them comes to pass, it hasn't.

------------------------------------------------

**Her tears will drown her**

This hasn't happened.

(Fun speculation: she tries to poison someone with the tears of Lys, but it backfires and she dies.)

------------------------------------------------

**""The valonqar"" will strangle her**

(Fun speculation: she gets resurrected after she poisons herself, and ""the valonqar"" has to strangle her pale *wight* throat. Doesn't make sense, since wights don't breathe. Never mind.)

Worth mentioning hear that ""the valonqar"" is needlessly confusing. No reason to switch to Valyrian for that one word, except that it opens up even more avenues for the prophecy to come true. We won't go down those avenues at this time, but will content ourselves with pointing out that this hasn't happened.

------------------------------------------------

** Melara will never marry because she'll be murdered by someone in the tent**

This one does come true, but since Cersei's the one who murders her, it's yet another instance of Cersei actualising the prophecy, as opposed to Maggy merely predicting it.

But it's worse than that: I think Maggy, in a way, brings Melara's death about.

These girls burst into her tent, demand that Maggy read their fortunes, and when she says no, threaten to have her whipped. Who wouldn't be upset? And we get ""malice gleam[ing] in Maggy's yellow eyes"". Do the messers become the messees?

&gt; ""Some are here who have no futures,"" Maggy muttered in her terrible deep voice.

&gt; ""You're a liar and a warty frog and a smelly old savage, and I don't believe a word of what you say. Come away, Melara. She is not worth hearing.""

&gt; ""I get three questions too,"" her friend insisted. And when Cersei tugged upon her arm, she wriggled free and turned back to the crone. ""Will I marry Jaime?"" she blurted out.

&gt; *You stupid girl*, the queen thought, **angry even now**. *Jaime does not even know you are alive*. Back then her brother lived only for swords and dogs and horses . . . and for her, his twin.

Cersei has just insulted Maggy on top of everything else. She's clearly an 'orrible little cunt, and you don't need psychic powers to see that it's not a good idea to hang around her in case she gets upset and has you pulled apart by horses.

On top of which, Cersei was perhaps visibly angry at Melara's presumptuousness, which Maggy may have picked up upon.

And, having picked up on it, Maggy then plants the seed of Melara's murder. Now, I ask ye this: if Cersei is angry at Melara, and Maggy has suggested Melara might die very soon, hint hint, and later that evening, she kills Melara...

Is that something Maggy predicted, or something she helped bring about?

&gt; ""Worms will have your maidenhead. Your death is here tonight, little one. Can you smell her breath? She is very close.""

&gt; ""**The only breath we smell is yours**,"" said Cersei.

------------------------------------------------

Finally:

&gt; There was a jar of some thick potion by her elbow, sitting on a table. She snatched it up and threw it into the old woman's eyes. In life the crone had screamed at them in some queer foreign tongue, and cursed them as they fled her tent. But in the dream her face dissolved, melting away into ribbons of grey mist until all that remained were two squinting yellow eyes, the eyes of death.

Note that there's a clear difference between the dream Cersei's having and the way she actually remembers it. Given that it's established in the series that people can use mind powers to invade and implant dreams, this may well undermine the credibility of the entire vision: how much of it is really true, and how much is a false vision that Cersei doesn't recognise as such?

1152,"I don't know why, but her story just bothers me so much.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) The facts**

Ashara is pretty, has dark hair and violet eyes.

Ashara was one of Elia's lady in waiting. 

She's at Harrenhal.

She died at Starfall at the very end of the war after Ned brought her Dawn.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) The ""we can be reasonably sure""**

She danced with JonCon, Oberyn, a White Cloak (but probably not Selmy or he would remember) and Ned after being asked by Brandon because he was too shy to dance. (Source : Meera who's been told by her father, no reason to lie).

She may have moved around in Dorne during the war. (Word of God)

A certain number of people think she had a relationship with Ned and fathered a child (Jon) : Cersei, Catelyn through the Winterfell maids who know through Ned's soldiers, Edric (and Allyria Dayne by extension). Harwin tells Arya that it could have been but that he personally doesn't believe it. He also learned it at Winterfell, making him a non-new source of information.

*So, our sources of information on Ashara are : Edric Dayne, the rumours about Westeros, Meera, and Selmy.*

&amp;#x200B;

**3) The weird**

She was ""dishonered"" at Harrenhal by man X and had a stillborn daughter according to only Barristan. She ""looked to Stark"" afterwards, probably for comfort (according to him). It is unclear whether he distinguishes man X and Stark. It is unclear whether he thinks she was in love with the man X or Stark (or both if they're the same.) Stark can be either Ned or Brandon as it is unlikely to be Benjen or Lyanna.  If man X is someone else, it could be pretty much anyone who was at Harrenhall, but it is not likely to be Ned (see later). *It thus seems pretty clear that Ashara was pregnant at some point during the war.* 

The Daynes really like Ned, despite killing the Sword of the Morning, with Edric even going by the nickname ""Ned"".  It seems to be because Ned and Ashara had a passionate love story, which wouldn't dishonor Ned as they both free, and hopefully not dishonor Ashara because she's from Dorne and it's not too thrown upon. Or at least, that what Edric and/or Allyria believe.

Ned barely thinks about Ashara at all in any of his chapters, when we've already been told they might have had a love affair. This is a bit strange if their love story has any significance (Ned could very well think of her without thinking of Jon).

Danny's eyes remind Selmy of Ashara's. Curious detail.

Ashara is one of the only woman we know has thrown herself of a tower, the only one from South of the Wall, and Arya hears Dareon sing about  ""some stupid lady throwing herself off some stupid tower because her stupid prince was dead"". Is it her ? Is ""prince"" an artistic licence for any noble man ? Or is man X Rhaegar ?

Ashara can of course be a mere red-herring mother for Jon Snow. But we learn really new info about both Ashara and Brandon in the last book (ADWD). Especially the stillborn daughter + man X bit, and the lack of Stark's first name, and Brandon's bedding habits. This is a bit bizarre if neither has any significance.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Why did she die ? Or did she ? What about her babes ? The timeline's all fucked up anyway.**

First, by Word of God : no corpse.

&amp;#x200B;

*Baby timeline* 

There is anywhere from one to two years between Harrenhall and Starfall, and as Jon and Robb are thought to be very close in age, it seems unlikely Jon was conceived at Harrenhall.  Babies grow up so fast that it is very clear that Jon couldn't have been conceived anywhere but in the middle of the war. IIRC Catelyn never thinks about a precise timeline or links Ashara and Ned's relationship to Harrenhall, and may have dismissed the rumours if they had talked plainly of that. It leads credence to most of the rumors about Ashara being Jon's mother being false, and the people who think of that are misinformed (Edric Dayne, Cersei (lol of course), the rumors in general).

That leaves the stillborn daughter of man X and Ashara. We don't know if she's stillborn, or even a daughter. But, guessing at her parentage, Selmy clearly believes it is **not** Ned, as he thinks man X is dead when Ned goes to return Dawn to her. 

Who could the baby be, if still alive ?

Allyria seems most probable : she's obviously young enough that her marriage with Beric Dondarrion didn't happen yet in AGOT despite being betrothed for a few years, so &lt;16, but older than Edric who is 11 in ASOS. She doesn't have known parents.

Several theorists propose Ashara as the mother of Meera, Dany or fAegon. which all kind off have shaky timelines, but could work.

&amp;#x200B;

*Reasons for suicide*

Ashara has a wide array of possible reasons for her suicide. In the books people think it is about Ned  killing her brother, which could hold up if they were in love whether they had a child or not. This conflicts what Selmy seems to think :  it is because of her stillborn daughter and/or the baby's father's death. This is quite the contradiction (unless Arthur is the father which is very icky and unlikely). 

But her stillborn daughter died before the end of the war, and Brandon died very early on too, so it seems there should be a trigger event close to Ned's visit, which could be : her brother's death, whether Ned being the killer aggraved things or not, the death of Elia and her children, or not-Brandon-man X's death,  or maybe even Lyanna's death if she was in on Rhaegar's intrigue, which she very well could be. Of course, it could be any combination of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

*And if she's alive ?*

Most of the speculation about Ashara still being alive stem from there not being a body and finding mysterious women who are in their thirties. Septa Lemore, Qaithe and Howland Reed's wife are favourites.

&amp;#x200B;

1154,"Throughout the ASOIAF series, Brynden ""Bloodraven"" Rivers seems to take many forms and control numerous others in order to achieve his objectives.

&gt;""**I have been many things, Bran. Now I am as you see me, and now you will understand why I could not come to you … except in dreams. I have watched you for a long time, watched you with a thousand eyes and one.** I saw your birth, and that of your lord father before you. I saw your first step, heard your first word, was part of your first dream. I was watching when you fell. And now you are come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late."" -ADWD, Bran II

**In this post, I'd like to explore some, if not all of the possible wargs, agents, informers, disguises and glamours of Lord Bloodraven**.

***

#The Last Greenseer

&gt;""In a sense. Those you call the children of the forest have eyes as golden as the sun, but once in a great while one is born amongst them with eyes as red as blood, or green as the moss on a tree in the heart of the forest. By these signs do the gods mark those they have chosen to receive the gift. The chosen ones are not robust, and their quick years upon the earth are few, for every song must have its balance. **But once inside the wood they linger long indeed. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. Greenseers.**"" -ADWD, Bran III

Its well known that Bloodraven uses **weirwood trees and ravens**:

&gt;He turned back to the weirwood and studied the carved face a moment. It is not the face we saw, he admitted to himself. The tree's not half as big as the one at Whitetree. The red eyes wept blood, and he didn't remember that either. Clumsily, Sam sank to his knees. ""Old gods, hear my prayer. The Seven were my father's gods but I said my words to you when I joined the Watch. Help us now. I fear we might be lost. We're hungry too, and so cold. I don't know what gods I believe in now, but . . . please, if you're there, help us. Gilly has a little son."" That was all that he could think to say. **The dusk was deepening, the leaves of the weirwood rustling softly, waving like a thousand blood-red hands.** Whether Jon's gods had heard him or not he could not say. -ASOS, Samwell III

and:

&gt;""Fair."" The raven landed on his shoulder. ""Fair, far, fear."" It flapped its wings, and screamed along with Gilly. The wights were almost on her. **He heard the dark red leaves of the weirwood rustling, whispering to one another in a tongue he did not know**. The starlight itself seemed to stir, and all around them the trees groaned and creaked. Sam Tarly turned the color of curdled milk, and his eyes went wide as plates. Ravens! They were in the weirwood, hundreds of them, thousands, perched on the bone-white branches, peering between the leaves. He saw their beaks open as they screamed, saw them spread their black wings. Shrieking, flapping, they descended on the wights in angry clouds. They swarmed round Chett's face and pecked at his blue eyes, they covered the Sisterman like flies, they plucked gobbets from inside Hake's shattered head. There were so many that when Sam looked up, he could not see the moon. -ASOS, Samwell III

I can list numerous examples of weirwoods/ravens and we can debate all day about crowns/ravens, but for spacing, I didn't feel the need to elaborate. 

***

**The mother direwolf**

It is very possible or even likely that Bloodraven (who has been watching the starks for years) sent her south of the wall (there are only a few ways to get south of the wall):

&gt;""It's no freak,"" Jon said calmly. ""That's a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.""

&gt;Theon Greyjoy said, **""There's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.""** -AGOT, Bran I

***

**The bridges in Braavos**

I think this is a stretch, but included it for discussion:

&gt;Yorko swung them north of the docks and down the gullet of a great canal, a broad green waterway that ran straight into the heart of the city. They passed under the arches of a carved stone bridge, decorated with half a hundred kinds of fish and crabs and squids. A second bridge appeared ahead, **this one carved in lacy leafy vines, and beyond that a third, gazing down on them from a thousand painted eyes**.  -AFFC, Arya I

***

**Dead person in Meereen**

I love this one, even if I don't 100% believe it is Bloodraven:

&gt;Little children with swollen stomachs trailed after them, too weak or scared to beg. Gaunt men with sunken eyes squatted amidst sand and stones, shitting out their lives in stinking streams of brown and red. Many shat where they slept now, too feeble to crawl to the ditches she'd commanded them to dig. Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten stood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick lest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. **Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies**. Skeletal women sat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength called out. ""Mother … please, Mother … bless you, Mother … -ADWD, Daenerys VI

***

**The dwarfs in the *Mystery Knight* that steal the dragon egg**

If you are interested, I wrote a theory about how Bloodraven later either [kept this egg or gave it to Euron](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bu3fyq/bloodravens_egg_spoilers_extended/)

&gt;""Or a dwarf,"" Dunk blurted. **A thousand eyes, and one. Why shouldn't some of them belong to a troupe of comic dwarfs?** -The Mystery Knight

***

**Maynard Plumm**

&gt;Dunk whirled. **Through the rain, all he could make out was a hooded shape and a single pale white eye. It was only when the man came forward that the shadowed face beneath the cowl took on the familiar features of Ser Maynard Plumm, the pale eye no more than the moonstone brooch that pinned his cloak at the shoulder.** -The Mystery Knight

Also I love the depth of this quote:

&gt;Egg's ears pricked up at that name. **""Plumm… are you kin to Lord Viserys Plumm, ser?""**

&gt;**""Distantly,"" confessed Ser Maynard, a tall, thin, stoop-shouldered man with long straight flaxen hair, ""though I doubt that His Lordship would admit to it.** One might say that he is of the sweet Plumms, whilst I am of the sour."" Plumm's cloak was as purple as name, though frayed about the edges and badly dyed. A moonstone brooch big as a hen's egg fastened it at the shoulder. Elsewise he wore dun-colored roughspun and stained brown leather. -The Mystery Knight

- The first time you read it, you think **Maynard is saying he's a lowly distant cousin of Lord Viserys**

- The second time you read it, you realize **its Bloodraven and its just a lie**

- The third time you read it, you realize that there are (likely) **rumors that Elaena cheated on Lord Plumm and that the current lords of Plumm are descended from Aegon IV’s bastard**. Which of course they would be loathe to admit.

- Then you realize that **Bloodraven/Maynard is actually a half brother of Viserys Plumm**.

Damn I love this series!

***

**Theorizing necessary**

While this could easily be considered just world building, sometimes I thoroughly enjoy exploring quotes like this (see [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gvt9nl/the_sixth_direwolf_in_the_snow_spoilers_extended/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/eeoo8r/mels_glamour_quote_spoilers_extended/) for some more examples):

&gt;How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have? the riddle ran. A thousand eyes, and one. **Some claimed the King's Hand was a student of the dark arts who could change his face, put on the likeness of a one-eyed dog, even turn into a mist. Packs of gaunt gray wolves hunted down his foes, men said, and carrion crows spied for him and whispered secrets in his ear.** Most of the tales were only tales, Dunk did not doubt, but no one could doubt that Bloodraven had informers everywhere. -The Mystery Knight

Like the quote says, some of these are probably only tales, but lets have some fun:

**One Eyed Dog**

- One Eye is one of Varamyr's wolves who is later a part of Summer's pack

- Some other good possible ones (Septon Meribald's dog and the blind dog at LF's keep) but neither is a one-eyed dog

**Mist**

&gt;Tormund turned back. ""You know nothing. You killed a dead man, aye, I heard. Mance killed a hundred. **A man can fight the dead, but when their masters come, when the white mists rise up … how do you fight a mist, crow?** Shadows with teeth … air so cold it hurts to breathe, like a knife inside your chest … you do not know, you cannot know … can your sword cut cold?"" -ADWD, Jon XII

**Gaunt Gray Wolves**

This could easily describe Summer or Nymeria:

&gt;The moon was fat and full. **Summer prowled through the silent woods, a long grey shadow that grew more gaunt with every hunt**, for living game could not be found. The ward upon the cave mouth still held; the dead men could not enter. The snows had buried most of them again, but they were still there, hidden, frozen, waiting. Other dead things came to join them, things that had once been men and women, even children. Dead ravens sat on bare brown branches, wings crusted with ice. A snow bear crashed through the brush, huge and skeletal, half its head sloughed away to reveal the skull beneath. Summer and his pack fell upon it and tore it into pieces. Afterward they gorged, though the meat was rotted and half-frozen, and moved even as they ate it. -ADWD, Bran III

and:

&gt;Warm and dry in a corner between Gendry and Harwin, Arya listened to the singing for a time, then closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep. She dreamt of home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. It was not a good dream, though. She was alone outside the castle, up to her knees in mud. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and the castle faded before her, until it looked more like smoke than granite. **And there were wolves as well, gaunt grey shapes stalking through the trees all around her, their eyes shining. Whenever she looked at them, she remembered the taste of blood**. -ASOS, Arya III

Both Summer and Nymeria later obtain packs and then we have this Old Nan quote:

&gt;Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods."" -AGOT, Bran IV

If it means anything, it def speaks to Bloodraven's ambiguous intentions imo.

**Carrion Crows**

Obviously it can be debated about crows/ravens, but my intention here is just to point out possible theories that match this quote. There are numerous quotes regarding carrion crows after battles, etc. which could fit here easily, but instead Ill use one of Jaime's since he is speaking more thematically:

&gt;**This is a time for beasts, Jaime reflected, for lions and wolves and angry dogs, for ravens and carrion crows**. -AFFC, Jaime IV

***

As I mentioned some of the examples are probably just tales for world building and others (the bridges in Braavos) most likely don't involve Bloodraven.

I know I shamelessly self promote  (like a lot) but its the easiest way to share more thoughts that someone tie into what I am posting without having to expand the post longer than it already is.

The hat is used to help keep Eggs head from getting sunburnt as we know. Bc he shaves his head to keep his hair from growing out and being recognized. To hide his identity. Then the first time we meet Young Griff he has a wide brimmed straw hat and he’s also hiding his identity. On to the next one.

But the point here is what Littlefinger says about Brandon: that he still carries a “token of his steem”, it is precisely that “token”, Jon, that triggers Ned's dream.

Ned has the dream after he is attacked by Jaime Lannister when he was leaving a brothel in which he met one of Robert's bastards. That leads him to think of two things, one of the lust of men, which, in turn, makes him think of Rhaegar and that he surely didn't frequent brothels. So, for Ned, Rhaegar was not a lustful person.

Ned then thinks of Jon and how much *he looks like him.* Like Ned, Jon is not interested in prostitutes, but there is something else that Jon shares with Ned and not with his father and that is, that Ned is a second son, and as our ""bastard"", he always wanted to show that he could be as good as the first, “the trueborn”, and never could.

We know that what Ned has is a ""fever dream"", we have seen the dreams of other characters and ***clearly,*** they should not be taken as ""truths"", but as a **symbol** of things that may or may not have happened. In this case, the symbology is closely related to the prologue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Ned remembered the way **she** **had** **smiled** then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as *she gave up her hold* on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. **After that he remembered nothing.** They had found him still holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. **Ned could recall none of it**.”

Ned has this dream when it is pretty clear that the confrontation with the Lannisters is imminent and amid Robert's endless insistence about Lyanna’s death, even though she is supposed to have been dead for almost 15 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**“*****He dreamt an old dream,*** of three knights in white cloaks, and a tower long fallen, and Lyanna in her bed of blood.”

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see the basic elements of the dream:

· 3 white figures 

· A tower long fallen

· Lyanna

White is definitely a color associated with ghosts, dead, but also weddings. Strikingly the 3 Starks in the crypt have several similarities to the 3 Knights of the Dream, in addition to the quality of being, apparently, dead.

But not only that, the access to the crypt is in a ""tower long fallen"", the First Keep. If we also consider that Lyanna, one of the protagonists of the dream, has a statue in that crypt, ***a statue that she shouldn’t have,*** the dream begins to get far more interesting.

Before continuing the dream, **we need** to talk a little about Lyanna’s statue and everything **that is wrong about that statue**. The statues seem to have a clear purpose, which is to mark the Stark's line of power, that is, to show the order of the dynasty. The Starks' power passes from parent to older child without interruption and only passes to a brother when the older child dies without issue. Possibly, the dynasty has passed to a woman at some point, 8000 years is a long time and it is even possible that the dynasty has changed hands and only kept the name.

But it is clear that **the statue, the sword, and the wolf** are ***there for something bigger than the mere identity of the king or lord who dies***. Furthermore, the fact that the entire Castle was built **after** the crypt speaks clearly that what is important in WF **is the crypt, not the castle**.

Lyanna’s statue **makes no sense** in any way you look at it. She was never the ""Lady"" of the castle, if she had married, she would have ceased to be a Stark, so the statue doesn't belong there, even more, her husband’s line doesn't belong there either, the crypt is a ""Stark place"". Not to mention that had she died single and without issue, the statue makes even less sense, the crypt marks the Stark line ***and she wasn’t part of the line.***

Regarding Ned's ""love"", I really have my doubts.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, basically my theory is that** ***the statue is not Lyanna’s, but Jon’s.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Did you make note ***of the position*** of the bodies?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Will shrugged. ""A couple are **sitting up against the rock**. Most of them on the ground. **Fallen**, **like**.""  Prologue

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at the position of the 3 King’s Guards when Ned finds them in the dream:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Ser Arthur Dayne, ***the Sword*** of the Morning, had ***a sad smile*** on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his *right* shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent *was on one knee*, **sharpening his blade** with a whetstone. Across his white-enameled helm, the **black bat** of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce **old** Ser Gerold Hightower, **the White** Bull, ***Lord*** Commander of the Kingsguard.” Eddard X AGoT

&amp;#x200B;

1) Arthur has a ""sad smile"". In the same dream is Lyanna who has the same sad smile. Arthur never ***wields*** the sword; **he is not a threat**. In the same dream Ned thinks that Lyanna´s ""fingers had clutched his *as she gave up* *her hold*"" so, **she willingly renounces to something, nobody forces her**. If we consider that ""Ser Arthur"" is actually Jon, the ""sad smile"" makes much more sense. *It is Jon who unknowingly ""gave up his hold"" on Winterfell* by announcing that he wanted to join the NW, so in the ***dream the sword is never wielded***, he is no longer a threat to Ned's family.

2) Ser Oswell is “sharpening his blade” he is the only one that appears ***threatening.*** If there's one thing we know about Brandon Stark it's that he loved his sword.

""**Brandon** **loved his sword**. He loved to hone it***. I want it sharp enough*** to shave the hair from a woman's cunt,' he used to say. And how he loved to use it. 'A bloody sword is a beautiful thing,' he told me once."" The turncloack – ADwD

We have no idea if Brandon was good with “the sword” or not, what ***we do know*** is that he was the one who was born to command, and educated to do so, and that is relevant in Part IV. We also know that ""***his sword"" Jon, is ""sharp enough"".*** Jon is by far the smartest of Ned's ""sons"", moreover, he is always ready to learn.

3) Fierce old Gerold, the white, the Lord. He is clearly the oldest, Rickard Stark. But “white bull” also proves that the “white wolf”, the oldest, Jon, is the one ***born to rule***, which is just another way to call him the “true” Lord.

Let's take a look at the position of the 3 Starks in the crypt.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“There were three tombs, side by side. Lord **Rickard** Stark, Ned's father, **had a long, stern face**. The stonemason *had known him well*. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap, ***but in life all swords had failed him***. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were ***his*** children.” Eddard I AGoT

Ned supposedly fought the war for his family - that is, for Rickard, Brandon and Lyanna. For a culture in which the ""lone wolf dies"" so that the ""pack"" can survive, Ned's thought that all swords failed him, is at least striking. Unless as the quote implies, Ned does not consider himself part of ""his children"", but Jon Arryn’s son, which is completely possible, seeing how Theon's mind was a mess after spending half his life among the Starks.

But the worst problem **is the way** and *the order* of his family's death: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“And there's my grandfather, Lord **Rickard**, **who was beheaded** by Mad King Aerys. His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him. Not me, another Brandon, my father's brother. *They're not supposed to have statues, that's only* ***for the lords and the kings****, but my father loved them so much he had them done*."" Bran VII - AGoT

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the first problem, the most obvious. We have two different versions for Lord Rickard’s death. In Ned's mind “all swords had failed him” in Bran's sweetened version, “was beheaded”. 

In addition, we have a *third* version, Jaime’s.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“(…) the Starks had died before him, **Lord Rickard cooking in his armor** while his son **Brandon** *strangled himself trying to save him*.” Jaime IV ASoS

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's continue with the dream, but considering that the 3 ""ghosts"" in Ned's dream are not the 3 KG but Jon (Arthur), Brandon (Whent) and Rickard (Hightower).**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I looked for **you** on the ***Trident***,"" Ned said to them.   
&gt;  
&gt;""**We were not there**,"" Ser Gerold answered.  
&gt;  
&gt;""**Woe to the Usurper if we had been**,"" said Ser Oswell.”

&amp;#x200B;

Let's examine the details of the exchange.

1) Arthur doesn’t answer. He may or may not have been in the Trident. We don’t know. We know that the last place Ned saw Ashara was in Harrenhal, where Lyanna Stark disappeared.

2) Ser Gerold, that is, Lord Rickard, tells him that he wasn’t there, which we know is true, Lord Rickard was in Winterfell.

3) Oswell, who I said represents Brandon, says, ""Woe to the Usurper."" The Trident is where Ned married his brother’s betrothed. Worse, Ned is usurping his brother and his son, Jon. Whent doesn't deny having been in Trident, he only talks about the “usurper”, which means that at some point he was there and we know that this is true, it is from the Trident that Brandon goes to “die” to KL and is also the place where Whent was last seen, in Harrenhal’s tourney.

Now, let's recall Ned's recent experience in the trident.

Arya and Sansa fight over Joffrey ""Baratheon"". Arya escapes, Sansa feigns amnesia, and Ned is forced to kill Sansa's wolf ""Lady"", while Arya's Nymeria manages to escape.

We have two 2 women, two ""wolves"" one who escapes (Lyanna) and another who pretends amnesia, but loses her wolf, Cat. All thanks to a Baratheon prince.

We also know that Brandon was last seen fighting a duel for Cat's hand, which makes the phrase ""woe to the usurper"" sound far more threatening to Ned than to Robert. Furthermore, if the guards are the ones that are *really* saying those things, the threat would come from 3 men who apparently spend the war hidden in a tower in Dorne, which would make the threat sound like a joke. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""When King's Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.""   
&gt;  
&gt;""Far away,"" Ser Gerold said, ""or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and ***our false brother*** would burn in seven hells.""

&amp;#x200B;

Ser Gerold, as I said, is in fact Lord Rickard. There’s a very interesting relationship between Rickard, Jaime, the King and the Lannisters “golden’s word”.

Jaime was one of the witnesses of the Starks hideous murder, and obviously he has no good reason to lie, the Starks didn't mean anything to him.

The ""king"" of the crypt is Brandon, his statue **doesn’t belong there** either, Brandon officially didn’t die “Lord Stark”, because he is supposed to have died ***before his father***, not after.

So, what Gerold (Rickard) tells him is that if Lord Rickard had lived, the one who would “sit the throne” is Brandon, not Ned, the “false brother” who usurped him and deserves to “burn in seven hells”.

But, in addition, there is the detail that Ned tells Robert that the ""sin"" of Jaime killing Aerys is that Jaime was a ""sworn brother"", which does nothing but support the version of Ned usurping Jon but not killing him.

This is what Ned remembers of Aerys's death, speaking to Robert:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his **golden** **armor.** I can see him still. Even **his sword was gilded**. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head. ***How he glittered****!""* (…)  
&gt;  
&gt;""I was still mounted**. I rode the length of the hall in silence**, **between** ***the long rows of dragon*** **skulls*****. It felt as though*** ***they were watching me******, somehow***. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden **sword** **was across his legs****, its edge** **red with a king's blood**.

If we pay attention to Jaime’s symbolism as “the heir” we’ll see that it is so related to Jon that it makes you want to scream. Jon's “armor” is snow, that is, calling him “Snow”, snow also “glitters”. The “silence” that Ned mentions is *his* own armor, nobody knows who Jon's mother is because Ned refuses to talk about her. In fact, Ned never lied, he just kept silent. What he feels that looks at him when he accepts the position as ""Hand"", a position for which he clearly *wasn’t born*, and in which he soon proves to be a complete incompetent, are not the ""dragon skulls"" but the statues of the crypt. *The ""sword across his legs"" is actually the sword between Jon's legs*, that’s the true danger, had Jon been born a girl, he wouldn’t be a threat. The ""red"" of the king’s blood is actually Jon’s “wolf’s blood” that’s no “wild” but Stark to the bone.

This is what Ned think’s as he and Robert walk through the crypt the day the King arrives at Winterfell.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**He** **called** **for a lantern**. ***No other words were needed***. (…) **Ned went first with the lantern.** ""I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,"" Robert complained as they descended. ""In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, **a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.""**

&amp;#x200B;

The “glitter” that he remembers on Jaime is the lantern that he remembers using to go to the crypt that in the dream become the “false brother” that is a clear reference to Jon “Snow”.

The vague location, “far away” that Ser Gerold mentions in the dream is explained by what Robert tells him: “your part is as big as the other six combined” that is, the north, where Lord Rickard was and where Jon is , and far enough to no longer be a danger to the other 6, that is, his own family.

In time, “your part is as big as the other six combined” and that thought of his own family, comes “to shape” thanks to the magic of dreams in 6 northerners that ride with him to the tower: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“In the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. ***Proud*** Martyn Cassel, Jory's father; ***faithful*** Theo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been ***Brandon's squire***; Ser Mark Ryswell, soft of speech *and gentle of heart*; the crannogman, Howland Reed; Lord Dustin on his great red stallion. Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man's memories, even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist.”

&amp;#x200B;

If we pay attention to the description of Ned's companions, we will notice that each one symbolizes one of the members of his own family. Proud is Cat, faithful is Robb, Bran is the squire, Sansa is the ""gentle of heart"", Arya is the ""crannogman"" and Rickon is the great red stallion.

Jory Cassel is the one who died in Ned's arms moments before he passes out and has this dream. In the dream, Jory becomes the body of Lyanna, who I insist, didn’t die as I will prove in Part III.

It's Jory's body that Ned was hugging before Littlefinger arrived with help, not Howland Reed. In the dream, LF becomes the little crannogman.

“**He** **called** **for a lantern**. ***No other words were needed***.”

Ned’s “lantern” was his “honor”, he called Jon ***his*** bastard, “for all the north to see” no other words were needed, what kind of men would claim to have a bastard for no good reason? Except, until Ned had his own sons and none of them looked like a Stark. 

While awake, Ned still didn't realize why Jon Arryn was so interested in Robert’s bastards and why is important. But in dreams, he thinks of *his own problem*, because **someone is asking questions** about his own ""bastard"". In fact, Robert, no less, asked Ned directly who was the child's mother. It is Robert's insistence on talking about Lyanna that makes Ned ""remember"" the lies he told. It is intuiting his own ""bastard"" problem that makes Ned fear for his family.

Ned's problem is that ***he really doesn't think of Jon and Brandon as his family.*** 

The dream is his own mind, his loyalties divided, on the one hand, his desire to be ""the Stark"" and on the other, his honorable side that reminds him that what he did was wrong. Every time he has the dream the two sides fight, so in the dream Jon's side is defended by no less than Ser Arthur Dayne, the quintessential white knight, because that is the symbol of the honorable Ned. But every time, the duel is won by Ned ""the dark"" because he has the numbers. It’s always 7, his family, against one, Jon. 

What Ned and Robert talk about in the crypt explains the next portion of Ned's dream. The Siege of Storm’s End. Let's look at the conversation first:

&gt;""***You need to come south***,"" Robert told him. ""You need a **taste of summer** before ***it flees***. In **Highgarden** there are fields ***of golden roses*** (…) **Even at Storm's End**, with that good wind off the bay, **the days are so hot you can barely move.(…)** **Flowers everywhere**, the markets bursting with food, **the summerwines** so cheap and so good that **you can get drunk just breathing the air**. (…) ""**I swear,** ***women lose all modesty in the heat***. **They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle.** 

It is with the magic of dreams that ""the days are so hot"" are magically transformed into the fever that takes Lyanna (Rheagar). ""Flowers everywere"" is all the Starks maidens involved in the story and the women loosing ""all modesty in the heat"" becomes ""Lyanna’s bastard"" being born in Dorne.

Furthermore, ""You need a taste of summer before it flees."" And  ""women losing all modesty in the heat"" I think is a big part of Ned's problem regarding Jon, because the ""bastard"" was growing and he could have his own bastards. But the cruelest part is that Ned saw that on the night of the banquet, the night that Jon was finally shown that there was no place for him, Jon was drunk and asking to join the NW was a rush thing to do: **“*****the summerwines*** *so cheap and so good that* ***you can get drunk just breathing the air*****”** 

Of course, the “summerwine” is Jon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I came down on **Storm's End to lift the siege**,"" Ned told them, ""and the **Lords Tyrell** and **Redwyne dipped their banners**, and *all their knights bent the knee* to pledge us **fealty.** I was certain you would be among them.""   
&gt;  
&gt;""Our knees do not bend easily,"" said Ser Arthur Dayne.

It is clear that in the conversation between Robert and Ned Storm’s End is mentioned, and the names Tyrell and Redwyne are implicit: Highgarden, the “golden roses” and for Redwyne the summerwines.

The night of the banquet, which in Ned's mind is the ""siege"" because he was with Robert, is the glorious night when Jon finally ""bent the knee"" along with Benjen, who clearly is not part of the Ned family neither. Benjen is identified in the dream as one of the ""knights"" of the enemy who surrendered.

Now, this is the best part of the dream: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Ser Willem Darry ***is fled to Dragonstone***, **with your** ***queen and Prince Viserys****.* I thought you might have sailed with him.""   
&gt;  
&gt;""Ser Willem is a good man and true,"" said Ser Oswell.  
&gt;  
&gt;""But not of the Kingsguard,"" Ser Gerold pointed out. ""The Kingsguard does not flee.""

&amp;#x200B;

Darry is the place where the audience in which Cersei manages to get Lady killed is held. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“He remembered Rhaegar's infant son, the red ruin of his skull, ***and the way the king had turned away, as he had turned away in Darry's audience hall not so long ago.*** He could still hear Sansa pleading, as **Lyanna** had pleaded once.”

The name “Willem” is incredibly similar to another name that we heard regarding Jon: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""**Wylla**. Yes."" The king grinned. ""She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord ***Eddard Stark forget his honor***, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like …""

Wylla is the name that Ned gives Robert as Jon's mother, who of course is “his sister”, that is, his brother’s wife, not Lyanna.

Wylla, we later learn from a Dayne, was a servant in Starfall and was Jon's milk mother, which is absolutely reasonable considering that Jon was born there and not in a random  tower in the middle of nowhere.

But, also, remember that in Darry, there were two wolves (two ""lady starks"") Lady, the one who dies and Nymeria that survives and escapes. 

When Ned and Lyanna talk about Robert, father of countless bastards, Ned says exactly those words to his sister:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" (…) but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that ***he was a good man and true*** ...”

“Ser Willem is a good man and true,"" said Ser Oswell.

Oswell, that represents Brandon says that “Willem” is a “good man and true” talking about his son, Jon a good boy and “true” heir.

There is another name similar to Willem that also has a statue in the crypt.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“***Redbeard had been slain by Artos the Implacable, Lord Willam's younger brother***. **The Watch arrived too late** to fight the wildlings, **but in time to bury them**, the task that Artos Stark assigned them in his wroth *as he grieved above the headless corpse of his fallen brother*.” Jon II- ADwD

""Wylla"" is the name that Ned gives as Jon's mother, Willam is the name of ""Artos the implacable"" **older brother**. The similarities in this story with Ned's are clearly not coincidental. Also, the wildling King name ""redbeard"" suggests “red” as Dorne does.

The proof that Brandon survived and that Ser Gerold (the real one not the one in the dream), realized, is in the prologue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. ""**Dead** **is** **dead**,"" he said. ""***We have no business with the*** ***dead****.""* 

Gerold, as Gared, noted that it wasn’t Brandon the one who was dying, that's why he said this to Jaime:

&gt;“Gerold Hightower himself took me aside and said to me, 'You swore a vow to guard the king, ***not to judge him***.' That was the White Bull, loyal to the end and a **better** **man** **than** **me**, all agree."" Catelyn VII- ACoK

Surely, Hightower believed that Jaime had also noticed, but Jaime had his head elsewhere, he was thinking of Cersei and not paying attention to the men that were brutally murdered.

The dream ends:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""And now it begins,"" said Ser **Arthur** **Dayne**, *the Sword of the Morning.* He unsheathed Dawn and **held it with both hands**. ***The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light***.   
&gt;  
&gt;""No,"" Ned said with sadness in his voice. ""Now it ends."" As they came together in a rush of ***steel and shadow***, he could hear Lyanna screaming. ""Eddard!"" she called. *A storm of rose* *petals* blew across a blood-streaked sky, **as blue as the eyes of death.**

The ""now it begins"" is Ned's own mind that makes him fight against the ""ghosts"" of his family.

The ""Now it ends"" is obviously the end of the dream and the ""duel"" in which Ned beats Jon.

The one screaming Eddard is not Lyanna, but Jon who calls him “Lord Eddard” when they find the wolves. The storm of rose petals is obviously Jon ""flying"" on the Wall, blue as the eyes of death because Jon is already ""dead"" he already has his own statue in the crypt and is now trapped in the NW.

In the tower, not a random tower in Dorne, but in Starfall, Ned receives the final insult from his brother:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“It was the final insult. ""Brandon was too kind to you,"" ***Ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up*** under the little pointed chin beard. ***""My lord, no,"" an urgent voice called out. ""He speaks the truth.” Eddard IV – AGoT***

In this case, the ""small man"" that is put against a wall is Littlefinger. Brandon's final insult was the “little man” on Ashara's belly. 

According to Ned, Arthur would have killed him had if not for ""Howland Reed"", I think that what really saved Ned was the ""howl and deer"", that is, Jon's existence and his friendship with Robert.

Ironically, when the wolves appear in Winterfell, the cubs' mother is dead just like that a “howl and deer”, such a warning…

&amp;#x200B;

# b) This isn’t my Place

&amp;#x200B;

It is time to talk about another ""tower dream"", Jon’s dream.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Do you ever ***find anyone*** in your **dream**?"" Sam asked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jon shook his head. ""No one. ***The castle is always empty***."" He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. ""Even ***the ravens are gone*** from the rookery, and **the stables are full of bones**. That ***always scares me.*** I start to run then, throwing open doors, ***climbing the tower three steps*** at a time, screaming ***for someone, for anyone***. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. **It's black inside**, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow, I know I have to go down there, but I don't want to. **I'm afraid** of what might be **waiting for me**. **The old Kings of Winter** are down there, sitting on their thrones ***with stone wolves at their feet*** and iron ***swords across their laps***, but it's not them I'm afraid of. I scream that I'm not a Stark, that *this isn't my place*, but **it's no good, I have to go anyway**, so I start down, feeling **the walls** **as I descend, with no torch to light the way.** It gets darker and darker, until *I want to scream.""* He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. ""That's when I always wake."" His **skin cold and clammy**, **shivering in the darkness** of his cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, **his warmth as comforting as daybreak**. He would go back to sleep with **his face pressed into the direwolf's shaggy white fur**”

Jon's dream is very interesting for several reasons. Clearly the dream is about his identity, his desire to be recognized as a Stark and to know who his mother was.

Jon's dream has all the elements of the prologue which in turn has the elements of Ned's own dream. That is, Ned's dream of the ""Tower of Joy"" is his own version of Jon's nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

In AGoT’s prologue 3 men go in search of a group of wildlings, one of them, Will says that they are dead, the second, Gared, says that he trusts his word. Both Gared and Will want to leave and end the search because they are afraid. Waymar Royce insists on going to see the bodies personally, and when he arrives on the scene, he finds that there is no one there. ""**The castle is always empty**""

Ned supposedly goes with a group of 6 men in search of his sister and meets the 3 guards, who are keeping her inside the tower. Lyanna, lies dying for unknown reasons. When Ned manages to reach his sister, she dies. ""**The castle is always empty**""

Will realizes that the scene is wrong, ***that something is wrong***, when he sees the wildlings' axe lying on the floor, because it is a valuable weapon and nobody would abandon such a weapon.

Ned's dream suggests that the scene is wrong for **several** reasons, but the main ones are those mentioned in Jon's dream, that in the prologue are symbolized by the howling wolf.

1. The ravens: the physical similarity between Waymar, Jon and the ""true"" Stark look is not accidental, in fact, it is there to point out something. 

2. The stables full of bones: in reality what makes “noise” are the 3 statues together in the crypt as to indicate something important, which is precisely the number 3. This number is going to be important later at the time of Jon's death as I will prove in the last part. What ***really*** ***scares Jon is that he already has his own statue in the crypt, that is, he doesn't have a place to go when he dies, because his grave is already sealed***.

There is one other thing that Waymar’s death and Ned dream share **that is wrong**. The horse. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Lord Dustin on **his great** **red** **stallion**. (…) In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths *on horses made of mist.”*

The “Tower of Joy” is supposed to be located in the northern edge of the Red Mountains, a stallion like the one Lord Dustin rides, is the wrong mount for the mountain, not to mention during winter.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the **wrong** **mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling**.”

We don’t know why Ned choose those 6 men to go ""look for Lyanna"", what is clear is that if one of them mounted a ""great red stallion"" it would have been hard to get where he said he went. That is, the Mountains.

Furthermore, in the prologue, Will says that he had been a ""poacher"" before coming to the NW and that this was the talent for which he was sent ranging. The ""talents"" mentioned for Ned's companions seem more like those of witnesses to a wedding than to a ranging and rescue of a maiden. I think that is exactly the role of these 6 men, they witnessed Ned's wedding.

The ""great red stallion"" in turn symbolizes Ghost the wolf who is clearly the oldest, the one who commands and worse, has red eyes like the mountains of Dorne.

Waymar orders Will to climb a tree, a sentry, and find a campfire that woukd explain the group's disappearance. *They had to be somewhere*.

Will, who should have yelled, is not yelling at Waymar (someone) or Gared (anyone).

In Ned's dream, there is also the tower, but the 3 steps become 3 guards and the scream is Eddard!

In the crypt we have the 3 statues, none of them explain Lyanna’s disappearance, but ***they do explain why Jon dreams of, ""climbing the tower 3 steps at a time""***. With Rickard's death and Brandon's disappearance, the only thing standing between Ned and Winterfell was a newborn baby who had no idea of ​​his ""rights,"" which is why Ned ""killed"" him by naming him his bastard.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. **It's black inside**, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow, I know I have to go down there, but I don't want to. **I'm afraid** of what might be **waiting for me**. **The old Kings of Winter** are down there, sitting on their thrones ***with stone wolves at their feet*** and iron ***swords across their laps***, but **it's not them I'm afraid of.”** 

What Waymar finds in the middle of the night, and that obviously scares him to death, are 6 “beings” that speak an *unknown* language and who wear armor that makes them invisible in the woods, they are white, black, and gray.

Whoever confronts Waymar and challenges him to a duel, has eyes cold as ice and blue as stars. Blue is the star of the ""ice dragon"" that marks the way to the north.

What Waymar is facing is an ice-eyed ""wolf"" who has a sword in which no known human metal has been used to forge it. There's another sword like that in Westeros, the Dayne's. *This is not what Waymar is facing*, but it is what it symbolizes, ***a “frozen wolf” that has a special sword.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“***By ancient custom*** an iron longsword had been laid across the lap **of each who had been Lord of Winterfell,** ***to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts***. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing***, leaving only a few red stains*** ***where the metal had rested on stone.*** Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. **He** **hoped** **not**”

&amp;#x200B;

What Ned faces in his dream, what *he really* faces, is not the 3 guards, it's his own family, his father, his brother and his nephew ""Jon"".

Jon, unlike Ned, isn't afraid of the crypt's ""Old Kings of Winter"", he's one of them.

What Waymar finds are the “old Kings of Winter” that are “down there”, beyond the wall. ***Although not really.***

&amp;#x200B;

“I scream that I'm not a Stark, that *this isn't my place*, but **it's no good, I have to go anyway**, so I start down, feeling **the walls** **as I descend, with no torch to light the way.”**

&amp;#x200B;

Waymar, who went in search of 8 savages, finds himself facing this duel that clearly is not what he expected. ***Waymar looks like a Stark, but he is not***.

Ned who looks like Jon's father, but isn't, is the one who said, ""for all the north to see"" that Jon is not a Stark. In that single statement, Ned “light the way” that Jon had to take, that is, The Wall. 

The Wall, we know, is just a slow and cold way of dying.

On his way to the wall, Jon thinks about his mother and what would she think about his chosen destiny. ""***He's not like the others***,"" Jon said. ""**He never makes a sound**. That's why I named him Ghost. That, and ***because he's white***. **The others are all dark, grey or black**.""

The soundless white wolf, who has no say, is Jon's mother. The mother is the ""white wolf"" who *is not like the other wolves*, the others are gray (Brandon, Ned and Lyanna) and black (Benjen).

Jon's mother is a ""white wolf"" because she is a wolf by marriage, not by birth. Jon's mother, I insist, was Ashara Dayne.

In the middle of the fight Waymar finds his fury and shouts ""for Robert"".

**In his dream, Ned also ""finds his fury"" in the middle of the fight and the scream that is heard, loud and clear is Eddard! Everything Ned did, he did for him.**

&amp;#x200B;

In the duel beyond the wall, the ""Other"" laughs at Waymar despite the fact that he fought as well as he could.

Ned was ashamed: ""The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep for words.""

Ned, like Waymar, also faced a ""dangerous and armed ice monster"" who laughed at him, ""Jon"", the Stark of Winterfell.

Waymar dies of multiple wounds that leave him trembling and with his hands soaked in blood.

Ned wakes up from the dream with the phrase ""promise me, Ned"" and trembling.

Ironically, **Ned dies confessing his crimes, but not about Jon who is not a bastard, but about Joffrey, who is a bastard:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Tell the queen that **you will confess your** ***vile treason****,* command your son to lay down his sword, **and proclaim Joffrey as** ***the true heir***. Offer to denounce Stannis and Renly as **faithless** ***usurpers***. Our green-eyed lioness ***knows you are a man of honor***. If you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your grave, I believe **she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son of yours.""**

&amp;#x200B;

Before ""waking up"" to kill Will, Waymar was lying face down with his face buried in the snow. When he gets up, his face is unrecognizable.

Ned is beheaded using ""ICE"". Jon’s face, like Waymar’s, is ruined by the snow, when he is named ""Snow"" he loses his identity, and as Ned he is ""beheaded using ice"" that is, he is sent to die on the Wall, completely denied of knowing who he is.

There is nothing accidental about Royce's death, just as there is nothing accidental about Lyanna's crowning at Harrenhal or her subsequent disappearance.

Waymar is given the honor of leading his first mission, that is, he is “crowned”. Waymar's death, or rather his disappearance, had the desired result, which was to send Benjen out, and then the NW, to look for him.

Before Waymar's “disappearance”, desertions were normal, someone goes looking for Royce, *because he is Royce*, because he is “someone”, nobody went looking for the others. They just assumed that they had deserted, after all, the NW is nothing more than a bunch of murderers, thieves and criminals.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**“**Centuries of **windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film**, *and it often* ***seemed a pale grey*****, the color of an overcast sky** … **but** ***when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white*** cliff that filled up half the sky.”

1183,"**Prelude 1: Renly as ""Defender of the Faith""**

I've long found it curious that Renly should create his Rainbow Guard. (And no, [it's not because he's gay](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/To_Be_Continued_Chicago_IL_May_6_8/).) Stannis doesn't bother creating a formal order for his bodyguards to join. Presumably because his position is that he is the rightful king, and therefore the Kingsguard owe their allegiance to him.

But Renly's a usurper whatever way you cut it. How did he ever plan to get around that? Talking to Catelyn, he merely states that might makes right. But my theory for a while has been that his actual plan was to pose as a defender of the Faith of the Seven.

He can justify upjumping Stannis because Stannis has turned against the Seven, even burned a sept. *Sadly, my lords, my brother has been ensorcelled by a red witch from across the sea. We cannot let foreign gods rule over us!* That kind of thing.

Meanwhile, Joffrey is an abomination born of incest, who profaned the Great Sept of Baelor with a traitor's blood. (Sidebar: isn't it interesting to note that possible crony Littlefinger is probably the one who talked Joffrey into doing that? And Littlefinger seems to know all about Stannis's new religious convictions, too...)

The King of Westeros's titles include ""Defender of the Faith"". We're all aware of how destabilising Renly's putsch would be if he won. I see no better path to long-term legitimacy than embracing the establishment religion. (He even [""prays"" with Loras](https://storiescdn.hornet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/19004400/Brokeback-Mountain-.jpeg) the night before his battle with Stannis!)

**Prelude 2: The Brave Companions birthed the Sparrows**

This isn't my theory. I first heard it in a Preston Jacobs video. (I believe it was one of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TBfdd_xNVo&amp;list=PLCsx_OFEYH6uvfZSfec35DXBEpvA9fpm0); if someone knows which one specifically, I'll gladly edit the correct link in.) It may even be original to him. ([Here it is in handy writing form](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/109565-oberyns-sellsword-company-was-the-brave-companions/).) All hail Preston of House Theory!

Anyway, I never bought it. It's one element of his giant ""[Dornish Masterplan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TBfdd_xNVo&amp;list=PLCsx_OFEYH6uvfZSfec35DXBEpvA9fpm0)"" theory, which I like, but the Brave Companions angle felt thin.

For our purposes here, though, all we need to do is acknowledge the evidence he marshalled that the Brave Companions seem to be going out of their way to attack the Faith: they rob septs, kill septons, rape septas, submerge a seven-sided crystal in a jar of piss and display it in a public gallery as if it were art, lol - point is, they're committing an enormous amount of sacrilege, *and they're doing it in Joffrey's name*. (And later, in Robb Stark's name.)

This sacrilege is the direct cause of the Sparrow movement - IIRC, Preston has the Sparrows as Dornish agents as well, right? Personally, I don't think this means the Sparrows and the Brave Companions are in cahoots. Call the one blowback for the other.

If only there had been a Defender of the Faith around, eh?

**Theory about Urswyck the Faithful**

After the band breaks up, most of the former Companions make for Essos, by one way or another, which is smart since they're all wanted outlaws. But Urswyck - Urswyck the Faithful - leads a small band to Oldtown.

This is very stupid, since it means he'll be spending more time in Westeros when he should be fleeing to Essos, *and* he's a sept-burning blasphemous monster heading for the very seat of the Faith. Imagine it were the middle ages and you burnt a cathedral and raped a nun. Would you hide out in Rome?

So why's he going to Oldtown, then? Well, very simply, I think he wants to get paid.

I think the Renly/Tyrell axis includes the Oldtown powers, which includes the Faith; I think they engineered the Brave Companions's holy terror to blacken the names of Renly's rivals and justify his claim on the throne.

""Faithful"" is thus a textual hint connecting Urswyck to the Starry Sept, as well as ironic, since he appears to have been setting his erstwhile boss up for a fall from the get-go. A sacrificial goat, if you will.

Questions remain:

The Brave Companions are involved quite early in the war, so how early did the Tyrells make these plans? Earlier than Renly's crowning? I have [speculated in the past](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9rcuwn/spoilers_extended_what_was_in_it_for_renly/) that they planned to make Renly king all along...

It's hard to see such big plans being entrusted to some crusty sellsword; it's easier to see Urswyck as a dumb-dumb who only knows that some feller in Oldtown offered him big money to burn a few septs, and who's heading there to collect.

But if he's not that bright, and only out for the money, why didn't he abscond with Jaime Lannister and rake in a huge payday? He says only a fool would trust an oathbreaker - but then, why does he trust Jaime when Jaime says Brienne's worth her weight in sapphires?

Is he stupid or not?

And anyway, *he's* an oathbreaker. And so's Hoat!

Final nugget: Urswyck squeezes the word ""confess"" into conversation. 100% confirmation right there

-----------------------------------------------------

**TLDR: Urswyck the Faithful was hired to persecute the faithful in Joffrey's name so that Renly could swoop in and save the day.**

Without Renly around, the faithful had to help themselves. It's ironic that the Sparrows ended up arresting Margaery, and may kill her: like I said, blowback.

1185,"It drives me crazy reading these books. There are so many amazing chapter endings that I get annoyed and frustrated switching to a different character. Especially if it's a huge change of perspective, like Jon to Sansa. There are always these suspenseful cliffhangers and it's really hard for me to be so caught up in one story, and then be ripped from it and dropped into another. 

Every time, I try to read the next chapter but have to take a break cause it can't hold my attention. I'm too wrapped up thinking about the implications of the previous chapter to invest in the slow start of the next. But then I return a day later and get just as engrossed in the next chapter.

When I reflect on this staccato rhythm of the series, it actually seems very intentional. The way GRRM writes is very careful, planned and deliberate. It feels like these breaks are built in to the story to give the reader time to ruminate on the material and new information gained.

To me, this is the mark of a master storyteller. He's not only writing what is fun, engrossing and interesting to himself. He is considering the effect his prose on the reader. To contrast, I read the last 4 Harry Potter books in one to three days. I was obsessed with them but I forget so many details that you would think I've only seen the movies. Rowling wrote so that I could never put it down but Martin writes so I have to put it down. 

The downtime is integral to his story because his story is not direct. It is in the subtext and the seemingly throwaway details that you find the meat and motivations. If I consumed it like HP, I would miss the core and be confused. But because of the careful crafting, I can't consume it like that and am forced to think about almost every chapter carefully.

Aurane was captured at the battle of the Shitwater... cough... cough... Blackwater and Knelt to Baster Joffrey Waters, after Tywin's death, Cersei appointed Aurane as the Grand Admiral.

At the end of ADWD, Aurane Waters stole Lannister's ships and sailed to Stepstones.

1195,"There was a post a few days ago about the symbology of the color purple in ASOIAF ([Blue+Red=Purple](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gvle79/spoilers_main_blue_red_purple_significance/)), and, on that topic, there is a detail in the worldbuilding that has bothered/intrigued me for a while.

Short version: in the real world, purple has associations with aristocracy and, to a lesser extent, to classical antiquity. In ASOIAf, one of its main associations is with Braavos, which opposed the Valyrian empire and stands out for having a more modern societal structure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Long version: 

Purple is associated with royalty due to the history of Tyrian purple, an expensive and high-quality dye produced from marine snails in antiquity. In particular, it was an important symbol of political power in Ancient Rome. 

&amp;#x200B;

The historic tidbit of snail dyes was included in the ASOIAF world but in a significantly modified form. This is a bit odd, because a direct transposition would make for a neat reference to Valyria ≈Rome. Valyrians have their extra-special fantasy purple eyes, which are directly related to their source of magical power; it would make sense to have them associated with an expensive purple dye that accentuates their unique physical traits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, in ASOIAF, the snails are discovered in Tyrosh, when it's already a Valyrian colony. Unlike Tyrian purple, the Tyroshi dyes come in a very wide range of colors, which means the connection between purple and quality/wealth is never formed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, there's Braavos. They also discover snails, but these ones only produce purple. Again, unlike Tyrian purple, Braavosi purple is apparently so cheap to obtain that they are dyeing sails and hulls with the stuff. 

Braavos' worldbuilding stands opposite to the connotations of real-world purple. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another tangent, but Braavos' most direct real-world counterpart would probably be the Netherlands (water and canals, a tradition of religious tolerance, sea trade, development of capitalism). Curiously, the Netherlands has a well-defined national color (orange) tracing back to the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs.

&amp;#x200B;

1197,"I've seen various discussions on here about the significance of the colors of the Fork (red, green, blue) and what they might tie to in-universe. Things like the eyes colors which we see. And someone posted about purple and said that it had to do with magic and a comment on that post mentioned light sabers and Mace Windu. In that instance, it was a part of Sam L Jackson's contract that he have that color to stand out in wide shots amongst the other sabers. But the original three colors for light sabers where (if I'm not mistaken) red, blue, and green. My question is do these three specific colors together correlate to something in our world? Like, I've heard that the closest real-world religion to the Jedi order is Hinduism (may have heard or remember wrong). Are these colors specific to something directly from our world? I'm wondering because maybe we could look to our world to decode more of ASOIAF instead of trying to search in-world alone. For instance, Charlemagne's grandfather was Charles **Martel**, literally Charles the **Hammer**. In ASOIAF, the **Hammer** of the waters was used to break the arm of Dorne.

- We can't assume Arthur's relationship with his Elder Brother was a warm one. In fact, I tend to lean that it probably wasn't towards the end. We're told that Dawn is a sought after sword and many people would love to weild it. Gerold Dayne certainly seems envious of Arthur in the current story so I don't think Arthur been granted Dawn would not have affected their realtionship be it positively or negatively. Perhaps Arthur forgoing his familial duties and joining the kingsguard is more telling than we think. And if the Elder Brother wasn't in on Tower of Joy gate I can see him being angry with Arthur's actions. Perhaps, the elder brother saw Arthurs death justified/deserved or necessary. What I'm trying to reiturate is that the reaction to Arthurs death may not have necessarily been rage.

-Dawn is a **very important** weapon/symbol/heirloom to house Dayne. Their hereldry/history and prestige are so intertwined with it that if someone stole it they would essentially be making a mockery and disnnouring the Daynes. Ned returning the sword when he could have taken it is no small deal. By returning the sword Ned ensured that he showed honour to the Daynes.  It truly is something to br grateful to Ned for.

- The whole Ashara thing is a can of worms so I won't delve into that.

This is just my opinion. Obviously,we don't know or will might ever know enough about these chracter to deal with definites, but this is what I've deduced. Edric's name is simply an honour to someone who has shown honour to them. It's not that strange or far fetched and probably isn't tied to some grander conspiracy.",asoiaf,[Spoliers Published] The Elder Dayne Brother honouring Eddard is not so far fetched.

1231,"So we know Joffrey turned out to be a terrible person by the end, so much so that lady Olenna (with LF) stepped in to get rid of him for her grandchildrens' sake.

BUT, we know Joffrey also adored Robert, but never got attention from him, and only got attention from his narcissistic mother, whom we know made sure Joffrey never suffers any consequence for any action he takes, and drilled into his head that they are above everyone else.

It is also implied that Joff's attempts at taking authority like the execution of Ned, are him attempting (and failing) to emulate what Robert would do.

Even in the incident in which he cut open a cat, he first went to proudly show it to his ""father"".
Robert hit him, but Cersei made sure to cover for it, threatened Robert to never touch him again, and told Joffrey it was okay, in retrospect calling it ""some mischief with a cat"".

We don't know much more about his childhood, but it is reasonable to think that any sign of kindness would have been interpreted by Cersei as weakness, and any cruel or unusual act (like the cat or bullying Tommen) would've been encouraged as ""willfullness"" (in Cersei's words)

So, is it possible that Joffrey was actually a normal kid, that was simply put in a position of power and had no one to ever tell him no, and would've turned out to be a good person had Robert and Cersei raised him better?

1233,"So I recently finished ADWD and really enjoyed it and I've since been thinking over it. The first thing I did was take to the internet to find out what Quaithe's cryptic advice to Dany actually meant. Here's the full quote, for reference:

""The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.""

While most of it has been clearly explained by people smarter than I am (the ""Kraken"" is Victarion, ""the sun's son"" is Quentyn, etc.), the last warning left me confused. My first thought was that it referred to Reznak mo Reznak, who is repeatedly described as wearing a lot of perfume, called a ""seneschal"" and seems less than trustworthy. I even thought he might be the Harpy, but I don't think this is the case, nor is he ""the perfumed seneschal"", because:

1. It would just be way too obvious for GRRM.
2. The Harpy almost certainly isn't him (I'm inclined to say it's actually the Green Grace).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is probably obvious to you dear readers who have been thinking and theorising for years, so I apologise. It seems that, instead, ""the perfumed seneschal"" is the ship the Selaesori Qhoran, as we've been told that's what the name roughly translates to (I think the fact that GRRM chose to dedicate about a paragraph of dialogue to explaining the ship's name means it's of some significance).

We know that the ship, before it was wrecked, was carrying three characters who are all headed in Danaerys' direction - Ser Jorah, Tyrion and Moqorro, the red priest. This trio have, by the current point in the story, been split up, with Tyrion and Jorah being with the Second Sons and Moqorro working with Victarion. However, it seems pretty clear from Tyrion's TWOW sample chapter that all of them are going to be part of the Battle for Meereen on Danaerys' side - the Second Sons have betrayed the Yunkish and the Ironborn are attacking the slavers from the sea.

But for me, this is all leading to one big question. If all of these characters seem to be supporting Dany, *why was she warned about their approach?* I would say Quaithe was telling her to beware the ship because of its passengers, so which of them should she fear? Let's look at them each in turn:

**Ser Jorah** \- He's pretty desperate to return to his queen to try and win her back, no matter how low his chances of success are. I would say he's very unlikely to harm her, even if she rejects him once again.

**Tyrion** \- Considering that he's been travelling east for the specific purpose of allying himself with Danaerys, I can't see him acting against her in the near future, especially if he learns she saved his life in the fighting pits. It's possible this could change as the story develops, but that's speculative.

**Moqorro** \- This is where things get a bit harder to judge. He has clearly aligned himself with Victarion, at least for the meanwhile, and we know that the Iron Fleet have arrived to fight for Danaerys. But let's nor forget that Victarion intends to marry her and steal one of her dragons with the dragonbinder horn. Once he's got what he wants, he'll to head back to Westeros, claim power for himself and exact vengeance on Euron. Of course, it seems very unlikely things will go this way and he isn't the type to take ""no"" for an answer. If he turns hostile towards Danaerys because she won't go along with his plans, will Moqorro stay on his side? I'm not sure, but my gut instinct would say no. Unfortunately, this red priest is an inscrutable man and we don't really know what he's planning or thinking.

So I have to conclude this overly long and detailed train of thought to say that I'm really not confident in any of these characters being a threat. But if that's the case, why warn Dany of the ship? Quaithe's prophecies have been pretty reliable so far, so I doubt that she's wrong on this one.

1234,"Today, I was thinking about Tyrion Lannister and what did he do in all the 5 books majorly that had turned tables in the game of thrones.

All I could get into my head are only 2 situations.

1. Battle of blackwater:- He did a good job there in support of Lannisters and played a major role in that wildfire thing.

2. Killing Tywin Lannister:- He killed Tywin Lannister before escaping to Essos. And this is against Lannisters.

And majorly in the second case it was the major thing for the other powerful kingdoms which are against Lannisters. I accept that!

Like compare him with other ""adult"" major characters are like doing so many things (and most of them are stupid) but atleast doing them. Like Cersei, Catelyn,  ned and robb(in past) , Tywin, olenna, LF, varys and even Kevan did try to do something.

1240,"Currently rereading ACOK and had a thought that’s really nagging me. Stannis could have ended the whole drama in book 2, had he only killed Renly a little later! 

The Baratheon brothers could have easily won the war ( or wars) together. I get that Stannis the  Mannis wanted the throne but why didn’t he just pretend to give up his claim for a while? They could have smashed the Lannisters and Starks together, with Renly thinking he’ll be king. And after the last battle Stannis could have done his whole shadow thing a killed Renly. Not very honorable of course but I doubt there’s an honorable way to let a shadow kill your brother.

Same goes the other way around. Renly could have used the power of Highgarden and Storm’s End to give Stannis what he wants and poison him after the war. Stannis had no male heir so he would have been next in line and no one would have known.

1246,"I’ve just finished Fire &amp; Blood and I love how brilliantly the Dance is written: all its different players, betrayals, folly and shifts of power, but most of all due its mysteries which stay mysteries. Three completely different sources are mainly used and the truth is sometimes not even in one of them. I know everyone probably loves Mushroom, but I wonder, which explanations do you really believe the most? 

After a short introduction of the three sources I list down each event around the timespan of the Dance in which our sources differ. In all events, you can choose A (Eustace), B (Grand Maester Orwyle / Munkun / other GMs), C (Mushroom) or D (none of the above). Furthermore, the choices are only given when the stories contradict and are uncertain, not when Mushroom only gives some extra (debatable) details, such as Jace marrying a Snow in Winterfell, or when one story is considered as likely the truth nowadays, such as Addam and Alyn being the bastards of Corlys Velaryon. 

Our sources or choices:

**Septon Eustace** \- The septon in the Red Keep. Mainly biased towards Aegon II. 

**Grand Maester Orwyle / Munkun** \- Orwyle escaped his execution many times and starting writing down his work in the cells awaiting one of them. Biased towards himself and somewhat to Rhaenyra. The writings are later used as basis for the works of Grand Maester Munkun. 

**Mushroom** \- The court fool who included a lot of gossip, extravagancy and bizarre stories in his work, probably in order to sell his book more. Biased towards Rhaenyra and the size of his member. 

We must also not forget that the summary of the Dance, using mainly these sources, was written down by an Archmaester (possibly not in favor of Mushroom and in favor of their own guild)

In the beginning, Grand Maester Orwyle was not present and we sometimes resort to the source of other Grand Maesters for the third option. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Why was Daemon sent into exile in 112 AC?**

A: Eustace: He seduced Rhaenyra and claimed her maidenhead.

B: GM Runciter: The brothers just quarreled again.

C: Mushroom: He gave Rhaenyra lessons in the art of love in order to seduce Cole, which failed and Daemon tried to claim her hand to the king when Viserys heard of it.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. What is the reason for the ‘break-up’ between Rhaenyra and Criston Cole?**

A: Eustace: Cole confessed his love to Rhaenyra and she refused.

C: Mushroom: Rhaenyra confessed her love to Cole and he refused. Afterwards, she slept with Harwin Strong.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Why did Qarl Correy killed his presumed lover Laenor Velaryon?**

A: Eustace: Jealousy, as Laenor had a new favourite, a squire of six-and-ten.

B: GM Mellos: They just quarreled and Laenor was killed. 

C: Mushroom: Daemon paid Qarl to dispose of Rhaenyra’s husband, arranged a ship for him and cut his throat afterwards.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. The Harrenhall fire which killed Harwin Strong (and the Hand Lyonel Strong) was lit by:**

A: Eustace: Daemon Targaryen, removing a rival for Rhaenyra’s affections.

B: GM Mellos: King Viserys, removing the man responsible for the bastards of Rhaenyra and thereby making sure the truth could never come out.

C: Mushroom: Corlys Velaryon, vengeance for cuckolding his son Laenor.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5. King Viserys died in its sleep during the night. Was there a darker story to it?**

A: Eustace: Viserys death was anticipated for some time and the guard was instructed what to do when the day came.

C: Mushroom: The death of Viserys was planned, using some poison.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**6. The first blood of the Dance was the aged Lord Beesbury. How did he die?**

A: Eustace: Criston Cole opened his throat with a dagger.

B: GM Orwyle: He was seized and perished of a chill in the black cells.

C: Mushroom: Criston Cole threw him out of the window, where he died impaled on the spikes in the dry moat.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. What about the fight between the twins Arryk and Erryk?**

A: Eustace: Arryk prayed for forgiveness before they slew each other (no further details given).

B: Orwyle / Munkun: Arryk was sent to slay Rhaenyra and there was brotherly love until the end, after a long romantic fight.

C: Mushroom: Arryk was sent to slay Rhaenyra’s remaining bastard sons and there was brotherly hate during the short fight.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Afterwards, Rhaenyra was still reluctant to attack King’s Landing. Why?**

A: Eustace: She didn’t want to risk the lives of her remaining sons.

B: Orwyle / Munkun: She didn’t want to be seen as a kinslayer.

C: Mushroom: She was still griefsick over the loss of Lucerys.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

No main conflicting stories of Eustace and Mushroom between this moment and the taking of King’s Landing by Rhaenyra.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Why did Aemond let Criston Cole go south with his army alone (without Aemond and Vhagar) and did he not command obedience from him?** 

A: Eustace: Aemond could not bear the thought of leaving Alys Rivers.

B: Orwyle / Munkun: Out of respect for the older man.

C: Mushroom: The two men had become rivals for the affections of Alys Rivers, due to her love potions.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**10. What happened with Queen Alicent (and Queen Helaena) after Alicent mentions the bastardy in a plea for peace to Queen Rhaenyra?**

A: Eustace: “Speak again of bastardy, and I will have your tongue out.”

B: Orwyle / Munkun: “Speak again of bastardy, and I will have your tongue out.”

C: Mushroom: Alicent and Helaena were taken to a brothel and sold for a good price until they had bastards themselves.

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Helaena threw herself from the window after half a year of captivity. Why?**

A: Eustace: Lady Mysaria told her this night of the death of her son Maelor.

B: Orwyle / Munkun: Seeing the failing rescuers of Corlys Velaryon die drove her to this act.

C: Mushroom: She was with child (a bastard) after her whoring days.

D: None of the above (or below).

E: The King’s Landing gossip: She was murdered, ordered by Queen Rhaenyra

&amp;#x200B;

Again, we skip some time up to the time of the many regents of Aegon III. Aegon III was King after the poisoning of Aegon II. The final differing story between Eustace and Mushroom.

&amp;#x200B;

**12. Why did Cregan Stark spared the life of Corlys Velaryon?**

A: Eustace: The Mother moved him to mercy and he feared the wroth and power of Alyn Velaryon. 

C: Mushroom: A hand for a head. He granted the boon of Alysanne Blackwood in exchange for the marriage. 

D: None of the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hereafter, Mushroom is smart enough to decipher the murder of Queen Jaehaera Targaryen, but there are no major claims by the others in this matter.

My current thoughts are 1 D (there is truth in Mushrooms story, but not all), 2 C, 3 A, 4 A, 5 C, 6 A, 7 C, 8 AC, 9 AB, 10 D (only Helaena was sold I think), 11 C, 12 C. Yours?",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Extended) Here, AGAIN, our sources differ. Who do you believe the most during The Dance of Dragons?"
1247,"I just finished the final Jon chapter in ADWD. After reading it, I can't help but feel confused about his decision to ride south with the Night's Watch. It seems 1) completely foolish, 2) dishonorable, and 3) inconsistent with his previous actions.

For one (1), what exactly was his plan? We are told how the Kingsroad is completely snowed over and it would likely take MONTHS to get to Winterfell, especially considering that it took Stannis 53 days from Deepwood Motte. Many of the NW would probably die on the way. Also, is his plan to straight up join Stannis' army? Or directly attack Ramsay and then retreat to the wall? What is the long game here? He thinks that Arya is in trouble, but he wouldn't even know where to look because Ramsay says ""he wants his bride back,"" but there's no indication of her location.

2) Riding south, especially with the threat of the white walkers looming more than ever, is straight up desertion. Moreover, by taking men of the NW with him, Jon would be actively weakening the wall's defenses. I'm surprised he even offered his brothers to go with him. 

3) Jon actively tries to avoid showing favor towards Stannis the entire book. Although the lines may blur at times, Jon is always trying to remain impartial as is required of the NW. The pink letter makes him throw all this out in an instant? After reading this, I am disappointed with Jon because it doesn't seem like there is any clear plan for his venture south. Did he really make this rash decision on the premise that maybe he saves Arya (actually Jeyne) and kills Ramsay because it feels good?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Was Jon's Decision Here Out-Of-Character?
1248,"New to this sub so if this questions been asked and answered before apologies. 

I was mega into the series about 7 years ago, deep into the lore, reading the world book and the lands maps and regularly posting on the Westeros forums, however as time wore on we got no progress on winds of winter and the show began to disappoint I lost interest. With all my free time in quarantine and in vain hope Winds might arrive soonI’ve been doing a first reread since then and surprised how much I’m loving it. 

With 200 pages of Storm of Swords to go I’m starting to think about how to read the next two books. I always enjoyed Dance and Feast more than most people on the forums but still found the experience of missing half the story in each book deeply frustrating, even reading them back to back. So I think I’d like to read a combined version. 

I know several suggested combined chapter reading orders are out there and you might have some of your own. 

In general I love how Martin fleshes out the detail of the world and the plot and all it’s minor characters events and storylines, and want to get a sense of them unfolding in parallel as I read. I find both books 4 and 5 frustrating as they don’t really feel like complete narratives (other than Maybe Jon and Cersei’s stories) but segments of a connecting bridge from Storm of Swords to the last books of the series, which are themselves incomplete as the conclusions to Sansa’s story, Meereen and Ramsay in Winterfell were pushed back. 

I have the UK version of Dance with Dragons which was split into two volumes in order to physically bind the huge manuscript, the second book was subtitled “After the Feast” and supposedly starts at the point at which Dance catches up with the end of Feast and goes beyond it so characters reappear. I doubt the publishers actually bothered to find this point as it’s fairly randomly split halfway through between Tyrion’s 9th chapter and the turncloak. 

For that reason while I’m happy to jump between books I largely want to stick to reading order within them (particularly Dance) rather than moving back and forth in time, I do however wish to preserve [AFFC] &gt;!the reveal of Quentyn’s mission until Doran tells Arianne if possible, as I think without it the suspense/stakes in Ariannes story is lost. !&lt;

1249,"I'm going to be starting my second read through of the series after I finish Fire&amp;Blood, so my points may be completely wrong or irrelevant but this has been nagging at the back of my head for a while now so I'll write it here.

Tyrion and the Dragons.

Throughout the books George has dedicated several paragraphs to just how obsessed Tyrion was with dragons, from asking his uncle for one as a name day present to staring into a fireplace for hours on end, imagining that it is dragonfire. While he seems to come to terms with their extinction as he grows older he still holds a fascination for them. 

I don't see/understand why Tyrion wouldn't have more interactions with them, if not becoming a rider. The show gave him his moment of freeing Viserion and Rheagal without dying (replacing Quentyn) but after that there is really no further development of this supposed relationship/ability to not be devoured by two chained hungry dragons.

Tyrion's backstory is filled with his love of dragons and I find it difficult to believe it is simply a humanizing trait and not some sort of plot device, but there of course is no confirmation whether DnD actually followed Martin's idea or they did whatever the fuck they wanted...

1253,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't have any theory to offer. But that I only want to point out something in our real world that reminds me so much of Planetos' oily black stones: chromite and ophiolite deposits. If you're interested to know why, please read ahead.

Chromite ([wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromite) — (Fe, Mg)Cr2O4 — is a chromium resource. Chromium is a critical compotent of modern steel (~13% Cr makes steel stainless. And harder as we found out in the 1800s). As to whether ASOIAF's steel contains it, therefore establishing knowledge and demand of it, I wouldn't know. (The maester links have steel and valyrian steel, but no mention of chromium. In which case, any chromite deposit would not be purposely mined out, leaving it where it sits).

So anyway, why I always think of chromite everytime I hear ""oily black stone"" is because of the mineral's diagnostic property of luster. That and its color and where it is usually found. 

In my time at uni, we identified the mineral chromite by its iron-black or ""pitch black"" color, a metallic or ""greasy"" luster, and a brown streak (streak is a mineral's color in powdered form). 

Looking at it now, mineralogy websites don't mention the ""pitch black"" color (only ""black"") but [mindat.org includes ""greasy"" for its luster](https://www.mindat.org/min-1036.html). Moving on.

&gt;The throne of the Greyjoys, carved into the shape of a kraken from an ***oily black*** stone.. (WOIAF)

&gt;Born a bastard on the Iron Islands, [Maester] Theron noted a certain likeness between the black stone of the ancient fortress [of Oldtown] and that of the Seastone Chair.. (WOIAF)

Oily is just another word for greasy. That is even how the stones of Asshai are described in WOAIF:

&gt;Some say as well that the stone of Asshai has a ***greasy***, unpleasant feel to it, that ***it seems to drink the light***, dimming tapers and torches and hearth fires alike. The nights are very black in Asshai, all agree, and even the brightest days of summer are somehow grey and gloomy. -Asshai-by-the-Shadow

Remembering chromite with ***pitch black*** color, and the notion of black stone that ""seems to drink the light"" (like the image of pitch as in viscous tar) is just so amusing to me everytime I read the line. 

Chromite (SG= 4.5 to 5.1) is twice denser than *Earth's* average crustal density (2 to 2.6) but whether it's as dense as the oily stone blocks, it's hard to make sure:

&gt;Maesters and other scholars alike have puzzled over the greatest of the enigmas of Sothoryos, the ancient city of Yeen. A ruin older than time, built of oily black stone, in massive blocks so heavy that it would require a dozen elephants to move them. -Sothoryos (WOIAF)

I'll just leave that there and move on.

Chromitite (the rock containing many chromite minerals) is commonly found in ophiolite deposits. Ophiolite is consisted of materials from the oceanic crust and the upper mantle (the chromitite lenses are found in the mantle), scraped into the surface in a process called obduction — a process which simultaneously occurs when the denser oceanic plate subducts to the continental plate. [See the upper image of this figure to understand obduction.](https://i.ibb.co/jJS9BBv/P785798.jpg) Also note that mantle part or the chromitite is found in the lower layers of an [idealized ophiolite sequence](https://i.ibb.co/wgZPcYR/op3.jpg), meaning chromitite is expected to be desposited farther from the heart of the continental landmass compared to the other ophiolitic materials - like the Iron Islands and Oldtown perhaps?

So. What is the importance of ophiolite formation? It tells us where ophiolite can be found thus where chromite is: usually at the boundary of a (converging) continental plate and an oceanic plate. And while Planetos' geology is wack, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of ophiolites forming on the west coast of Westeros, where a Sunset Sea plate might be subducting to a Westeros plate, giving us the oily black stones obducted into where Oldtown and the Iron Islands sit. The only weird thing about this is why there is no line of volcanoes along the west coast of Westeros (Consider our very own Pacific Ring of Fire. What Westeros only has are the gold-rich westerlands and Winterfell's hot springs, which are proof of volcanic activity, but not enough for me). For the others, however, I have no starting point nor energy to locate the source of the oily black stones found in Asshai-by-the-Shadow or Sothoryos' ancient Yeen.

Going back, the point is that all these thoughts make me wont to imagine chromite rocks or a mystical derivative of it whenever I read ""oily black stones"".

**Tl,dr;**

1. I imagine chromite (or a mystical derivative of it) with its pitch black color and greasy luster everytime I read about the oily black stones

Chromite ([wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromite)) — (Fe, Mg)Cr2O4 — is a chromium resource. Chromium is a critical compotent of modern steel (~13% Cr makes steel stainless. And harder as we found out in the 1800s). As to whether ASOIAF's steel contains it, therefore establishing knowledge and demand of it, I wouldn't know. (The maester links have steel and valyrian steel, but no mention of chromium. In which case, any chromite deposit would not be purposely mined out, leaving it where it sits).

So anyway, why I always think of chromite everytime I hear ""oily black stone"" is because of the mineral's diagnostic property of luster. That and its color and where it is usually found. 

In my time at uni, we identified the mineral chromite by its iron-black or ""pitch black"" color, a metallic or ""greasy"" luster, and a brown streak (streak is a mineral's color in powdered form but that's not important for this post). 

Looking at it now, mineralogy websites don't mention the ""pitch black"" color (only ""black"") but [mindat.org includes ""greasy"" for chromite's luster](https://www.mindat.org/min-1036.html). Moving on.

&gt;Born a bastard on the Iron Islands, [Maester] Theron noted a certain likeness between the black stone of the ancient fortress [of Oldtown] and that of the Seastone Chair.. (WOIAF)

Oily is just another word for greasy. That is even how the stones of Asshai are described in WOAIF:

&gt;Some say as well that the stone of Asshai has a ***greasy***, unpleasant feel to it, that ***it seems to drink the light***, dimming tapers and torches and hearth fires alike. The nights are very black in Asshai, all agree, and even the brightest days of summer are somehow grey and gloomy. -Asshai-by-the-Shadow

Remembering chromite with ***pitch black*** color, and the notion of black stone that ""seems to drink the light"" (like the image of pitch as in viscous tar) is just so amusing to me everytime I read the line. 

Chromite (SG= 4.5 to 5.1) is twice denser than *Earth's* average crustal density (2 to 2.6) but whether it's as dense as the oily stone blocks, it's hard to make sure:

&gt;Maesters and other scholars alike have puzzled over the greatest of the enigmas of Sothoryos, the ancient city of Yeen. A ruin older than time, built of oily black stone, in massive blocks so heavy that it would require a dozen elephants to move them. -Sothoryos (WOIAF)

I'll just leave that there and move on.

Chromitite (the rock containing many chromite minerals) is commonly found in ophiolite deposits. Ophiolite is consisted of materials from the oceanic crust and the upper mantle (the chromitite lenses are found in the mantle), scraped into the surface in a process called obduction — a process which simultaneously occurs when the denser oceanic plate subducts to the continental plate. [See the upper image of this figure to understand obduction.](https://i.ibb.co/jJS9BBv/P785798.jpg) Also note that mantle part or the chromitite is found in the lower layers of an [idealized ophiolite sequence](https://i.ibb.co/wgZPcYR/op3.jpg), meaning chromitite is expected to be desposited farther from the heart of the continental landmass compared to the other ophiolitic materials - like the Iron Islands and Oldtown perhaps?

So. What is the importance of ophiolite formation? It tells us where ophiolite can be found thus where chromite is: usually at the boundary of a (converging) continental plate and an oceanic plate. And while Planetos' geology is wack, I wouldn't dismiss the idea of ophiolites forming on the west coast of Westeros, where a Sunset Sea plate might be subducting to a Westeros plate, giving us the oily black stones obducted into where Oldtown and the Iron Islands sit. The only weird thing about this is why there is no line of volcanoes along the west coast of Westeros (Consider our very own Pacific Ring of Fire. What Westeros only has are the gold-rich westerlands and Winterfell's hot springs, which are proof of volcanic activity, but not enough for me). For the others, however, I have no starting point nor energy to locate the source of the oily black stones found in Asshai-by-the-Shadow or Sothoryos' ancient Yeen.

Going back, the point is that all these thoughts make me wont to imagine chromite rocks or a mystical derivative of it whenever I read ""oily black stones"".

1. I imagine chromite (or a mystical derivative of it) with its pitch black color and greasy luster everytime I read about the oily black stones

1258,"When I read the series after seeing the television show (so basically knowing the Plot of the first 3 books) I was at several points a bit dumbfounded. What comes to mind is how the direwolves react to Tyrion in Winterfell when he offers the plans for Bran's special sattle. They growl at him and almost bite him, which seems like pretty big foreshadowing. In every other instance I remember, a Direwolf not liking someone is a direct hint for a betrayal or someone dishonest.

In this case, this is far from happening: Not only does Tyrion came there in good faith, he is through the books the most ""stark-friendly"" Lannister. So, since we know from his POV that he had no bad intentions, the direwolves' reaction means that they can be wrong, that sometimes they just dislike people for no reason with no meaning behind it. That doesn't really fit with the rest of the series. You could say it is a red herring, but that being the only time the direwolves are wrong in their judgement, it would seem kinda random.

I read somewhere that the reaction of the direwolves comes from a time when George had other plans for the plot - if that is true, then it actually is kind of an error that it is in there.

What would you think of a rewrite of parts like this?

1265,"I was thinking about what Theon could have done differently in the series to improve his lot in life. This question has about a billion answers since his entire arc is a series of shitty decisions with disproportionately shitty consequences. But I also realized that even if Theon had made the right decisions every time, he would still be in a horribly unfair situation that spares him very little honor. He was destined to be named ""Theon Turncloak"". It's almost unavoidable.

His biggest problem as the series begins is his identity crisis the size of casterly rock, so IMO the best possible outcome for him would be one in which that identity crisis is resolved.  Unfortunately that situation is impossible right from the get-go. 

We know from a POV in Dance that deep down Theon wanted to be truly accepted by the Starks as part of the family but that is almost impossible for political reasons that we all know.  Even if that somehow came to pass, and somehow they adopted him, it's not a super healthy dynamic given that he lived with the knowledge that said family might behead him for things out of his control. Real world psychologists would have a tough time unraveling that tangle of trauma. 

Anyways, he cannot pursue his true desire for family in the Starks because, in addition to the previously mentioned threat of beheading, it would also cost him a lot of honor even IF he succeeded. He would be disavowed by his own blood as a turncloak right before a rebellion breaks out, which may actually result in the family he truly wants killing him in a twist if irony.

We know that sticking to blood and heritage over his true desires is also far from ideal since that's exactly what he does in Clash, but he didn't even have much of a choice. 

I cannot state this enough: His meeting with Balon leads to an absolutely impossible crossroads (such a stupid decision for Robb to send him) and it's incredibly unfair to give him shit for picking either path. He can stick with his family and ""betray"" the people who raised him under an unspoken death threat OR turn his back on family and return to the people that raised him under an unspoken death threat, only with the knowledge that his family will now be waging war on him as well. What the fuck kind of choice is that?? Either way he will be named a turncloak and betrayer.


So exactly how the hell could Theon ever hope to have a happy ending? Doesn't look good from the start, but some possibilities are better than others. Here are my three best case scenarios for Theon resolving his crisis. Feel free to add your own.

1. If Balon has said fuck it and rebelled while Theon was a hostage sometime AFTER Ned's death but BEFORE Robb sends Theon to Pyke, that might have made things easier. Neither I nor anyone else can say for sure that Robb would have killed Theon as Ned threatened to, but I don't think he would have. That's just my opinion.. Theon would be feel hurt and betrayed by his family giving him up for dead over a crown, but it would have cemented his wish to be a Stark even as it became his only option. Crisis resolved? Maybe not, seems to me that depends entirely on Robb.

2. If Ned had not been so kind to Theon than this identity crisis would likely never have developed in the first place. By raising the kid as one of his own he put Theon in a super confusing situation. Had Ned kept Theon away emotionally and emphasized his position as a hostage, not a ward, Theon would probably have doubled down on his heritage. It wouldn't be a happy upbringing but it would be less conflicting. When Theon finally gets an opportunity to leave, by escape or otherwise, it would not be seen as a betrayal. Enter confident Pirate Theon.

3. I considered Nights Watch Theon as the easiest course to honor and an identity crisis remedy, but Ned would never have allowed his hostage to do that.

4. Outlaw Theon rejects both Stark and Greyjoy and lives his life as a member/leader of some kind of Wolfswood Brotherhood outlaw band.

Doubtless there are other possibilities but my point is that a truly happy ending was never likely for Theon and i really do feel for the guy, despite some of his awful behavior. I cannot wait to see how GRRM decides to bring him peace.",asoiaf,The game is rigged against Theon. [Spoilers extended]
1266,"To say that Sansa Stark is one of the more controversial characters in ASOIAF is hardly going to raise any eyebrows. In the eyes of fans, she is both victim and screw-up, a vapid young girl and a noble soul. 

It's not hard to see why she inspires so much hatred. After all, GRRM casts her as the unsympathetic Stark, the aloof and surface-focused foil to Arya's more down-to-earth approach. That the show dropped her plot line of telling Cersei about her father's plans was not entirely surprising, as it could be argued that it stacks the cards too much against her. Yet the show bungled her arc from then on forwards, misinterpreting the point of the character in the same way that I think a lot of readers do as well. 

In this post, I will focus what I believe to be one of Sansa' most important themes: the burden of being a disappointed idealist. I will try to showcase that the point of Sansa is not to become a hardened cynic, nor a badass Machiavellian power manipulator, but rather the Queen of Love, a woman who inspires others perhaps even more than they inspire her.

Central to this argument is my belief that Sansa is just one of many disappointed idealists in ASOIAF. I'll argue that she meets three of them during her captivity in King's Landing (Sandor, Littlefinger, and Cersei), and that GRRM uses juxtaposition to showcase why Sansa ultimately won't become like them.

Side-note: one could argue that there are other disappointed idealists  like Jaime, Dontos Hollard, and Barbrey Dustin. Jaime and Lady Dustin aren't really juxtaposed that directly with Sansa, so I won't discuss them here. And while Dontos *is* closely linked to Sansa (both plot-wise and thematically), I've decided to mostly disregard their relationship in this post, primarily to save space.

**Sansa's change**

When the story begins, Sansa is a naive young girl, a [real-life Disney princess](https://racefortheironthrone.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/chapter-by-chapter-analysis-sansa-i/). She has an annoying habit of thinking beauty = goodness (which makes her blind to the true nature of Joffrey and Cersei), she has a deeply problematic view of the smallfolk, and she views knights as the upholders of justice and chivalry.

Needless to say, these views are changed quickly. While Sansa doesn't exactly internalize the struggles of the smallfolk during AGOT, she gets a sharp and brutal lesson in the true nature of both Joffrey and Cersei, finally seeing them both for who they really are at the end of the book.

She also learns that knights are not the heroes she's been led to believe, but would-be monsters, as evidenced by the Kingsguard beating her frequently at Joffrey's behest (Arys Oakheart protests to Joffrey and beats her less hard than Meryn Trant and Boros Blount, but he still beats her).

Yet she still carries some blindspots. When Littlefinger begins to plan his escape with Sansa, he deliberately enlists Dontos Hollard, who not only gaslights her, but plays on her still-existing beliefs that knights can be warriors of justice.

Here, I would argue that there is some mummery going on GRRM's part. Because the Kingsguard are such obvious monsters, and because Dontos is revealed to be a fraud, both Sansa and the readers are tricked into believing that cynicism is the answer, that the only way Sansa can evolve is to embrace nihilism.

I don't think things are so easy.

**Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane**

At first glance, Sandor has little in common with Sansa. He is a giant of a man, a cynical soldier who's seemingly uninterested in keeping the company of young girls. Yet GRRM pushes him in Sansa's direction anyway, often more than she is comfortable with (and who can blame her, considering his behavior?). Yet I'll argue that Sandor has more in common with Sansa than he is comfortable admitting. 

Like Littlefinger and Cersei, Sandor Clegane offers a twisted version of what Sansa Stark might become as an adult. As we glimpse in his backstory, sometimes directly and sometimes through hints, Sandor was an idealist himself once. After all, it took a deeply traumatic event (caused by his own brother, no less) to turn him into the angry man he is today.

We don't know too much about Sandor's thinking as a child, yet I think it's telling that he is playing with a *toy knight* when Gregor burns him. It's circumstantial evidence, yet it's bolstered when we learn that Sandor renounced knighthood forever after Gregor was knighted later, which soured the concept forever in the eyes of the young Clegane:

&gt;""I'll tell you what it was, girl,"" he said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath. ""I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father's keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don't remember what I got, but it was Gregor's gift I wanted. **A wooden knight**, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they know? Only a man who's been burned knows what hell is truly like.  
&gt;  
&gt;""My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me ointments. Ointments! Gregor got his ointments too. Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and **he recited his knightly vows** and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, ‘Arise, Ser Gregor.' "" 

In Sandor's mind, knighthood and Gregor are inherently linked, and his burning is the original sin that made him renounce knighthood forever. As Sandor sees it, knightship is inherently false, a "" prettyribbon around the sword."" 

Yet he doesn't challenge this conception by actually upholding the vows of knights himself (that's Brienne). Sandor might not want to be a ""ser,"" but neither does he want to do the hard work of protecting the weak. By renouncing not just knighthood, but heroism as well, he mentally finds a way to justify his own brutality.

We see that clearly when Sandor kills Mycah, a brutal act that seemingly casts Sandor more like his brother than an opponent of false knights. This cements his status as a cynic and believer that the world is bad, that there is no point in upholding knightly vows. Instead of facing the reality (that being an upholder of justice is hard and demanding work), Sandor takes the easy way out.

Yet we see the young idealist slip through once in a while. While Sandor is cruel when *speaking* to Sansa (which he does often), his *acts* paints a more complicated picture. When Joffrey orders her naked after Robb's victory at Oxcross, Sandor steps forward and drapes her in his cloak. And when the smallfolk later rebel, Sandor rescues her from the mob.

For all his tough and cynical talk about nihilism, the real Sandor slips through occasionally. His mission to ""educate"" Sansa fails, and when he breaks at the Blackwater, it is Sansa he seeks out, drunkenly asking her for a song. And while she complies with his request, I think he realizes that he has failed to educate her in his ways. Sansa still fears him, yet instead of submitting to his escape, she feels sorry for him:

&gt;Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers. The room was too dark for her to see him, but she could feel the stickiness of the blood, and a wetness that was not blood. 

That wetness is tears, of course. Sansa passes the test. She doesn't succumb to Sandor's nihilism.

**Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish**

Despite posts springing forth every once in a while proclaiming Littlefinger to be a champion of the smallfolk (flat no), I think it's safe to say he has less shades of grey than Sandor, and that he's a more full-fledged villain. After all, this is the guy that started the War of the Five Kings!

True, Littlefinger can point to a rags-to-riches story, but there's another aspect I want to focus on in this post, namely his duel with Brandon Stark:

&gt;They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. ""He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die."" And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her.  
&gt;  
&gt;That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair, raining steel on him with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds. ""Yield!"" he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly. When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr's rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal. He looked at her as he fell and murmured ""Cat"" as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers. She thought she had forgotten that. 

This passage is usually analyzed through the prism of Littlefinger's obsession with Catelyn (even after her death), but there is also something else that's important: Littlefinger's idealism. Call it dumb if you will (I will bear you no ill will), but there's actually something *Sansa-esque* in Littlefinger's belief that this is a duel worth fighting. 

True, he is hopelessly in love with Catelyn in this moment, probably fearing he'll lose her forever, but it's still a duel against Brandon Stark, who has the temper and size to not only beat this young INCEL, but also kill him.

I believe that, apart from Littlefinger not heeding his better instincts, there's a hint of romanticism driving him here. After all, he is not challenging Brandon to a 10-lap run round Riverrun here, but actual swordplay. Littlefinger might never admit so himself, but perhaps the young boy actually thought true love would conquer all that day, maybe even lend strength to his sword? (I guess you could argue that love *did* win, considering Catelyn saying she loved LF as a brother, but let's not dwell on that).

Needless to say, Littlefinger learned a lesson from the duel (not the *right* lesson, mind you). The grown man we meet in AGOT has not only left his fighting days behind him, but he's learned to thrive as a merchant and politician as well. More importantly for this post, however, is the fact that he's also left his idealism behind for a great deal of cynicism:

&gt;Her father's decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up, she'd been sure she was about to see one of Old Nan's stories come to life. Ser Gregor was the monster and Ser Loras the true hero who would slay him. He even looked a true hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses around his slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And then Father had refused him! It had upset her more than she could tell. She had said as much to Septa Mordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery, but the septa had only told her it was not her place to question her lord father's decisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;That was when Lord Baelish had said, ""Oh, I don't know, Septa. Some of her lord father's decisions could do with a bit of questioning. The young lady is as wise as she is lovely."" He made a sweeping bow to Sansa, so deep she was not quite sure if she was being complimented or mocked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Septa Mordane had been very upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard them. ""The girl was just talking, my lord,"" she'd said. ""Foolish chatter. She meant nothing by the comment.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Lord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said, ""Nothing? Tell me, child, why would you have sent Ser Loras?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Sansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters. The king's councillor smiled. ""Well, those are not the reasons I'd have given, but . . . "" He had touched her cheek, his thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone. **""Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.""** 

Look at this manly grown-up, wise beyond his years, giving away his life lessons (free of charge!) to this young girl. Gone is the chivalric buffoon from yesterday, replaced by a wise and and wealthy businessman!

Joking aside, it is a point in Littlefinger's favor that it is him, the cynic, and not the honorable Ned Stark, that survives the book (and still is alive). He may have become jaded, but he's learned to not pick the wrong fights anymore. It's not hard to see why both Sansa and the readers fall for this sales tactic. After all, it's working!

Still, Littlefinger's pitch remains just that: a pitch. Sandor becomes jaded because it's easier to deal with the pain, but it doesn't earn him much of a profit, and he becomes depressed. Littlefinger, on the other hand, sees his cynicism earn him both power and capital, and as honorable men fall around him, it's not hard to see he's got somewhat of a point.

On the other hand, as evidenced by the show, Littlefinger might not last forever. For the moment, he's got Sansa in his grasp, yet I don't believe for a second that her affections for neither him or his life lessons will outlive him. For Sansa, his will be a cautionary tale, not a source for inspiration.

**Cersei**

I wanted to do Cersei last because I feel that, more than Sandor and Littlefinger, her portrayal in the show is the strongest evidence of how Sansa is misunderstood. 

Just to be clear: while whe showrunners softened Cersei somewhat in the adaptation, painting her with more grey shades than in the books, it's my opinion that she remained a compelling character for a long time, all the way from the first season through the sixth.

But something changed in S7. Perhaps to fill the hole left from Aegon's removal, the showrunners felt a need to ""level up"" Cersei, portraying her as more effective than in previous seasons. Whereas the old Cersei could hardly climb the ladder without setting it on fire, S7 Cersei saw her nearly conquering Dany's coalation, smashing the Ironborn and the Dornish, completely blindsiding the Unsullied, before finally realizing how strong Dany's dragons *truly* were (not that it made her bend the knee).

However, more important to this post is a set of comments made by Sansa to Jon in the first episode of the season. First:

&gt;Sansa: ""You have to be smarter than father, you have to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, but they made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it.""

Then:

&gt;Sansa: ""You're the military man, but I knew her \[Cersei\]. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jon: **""You almost sound as if you admire her.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;Sansa: ""I learned a great deal from her.""

There are two points to made here. The first is that showrunners seems to have internalized the belief that ASOIAF is a world where ""good = stupid"" and ""evil = smart,"" and that Ned and Robb failed because they were good people. A counter to this argument could easily take up a whole other essay, but I wanted to bring it up because I believe it exemplifies how thoroughly the showrunners botched the thematics of Sansa's arc.

Equally infuriating is the thinly veiled insinuation that Sansa *admires* Cersei. While Sansa definitely learns a great deal from Cersei, we're not talking *direct* lessons. Rather, Sansa learns to that ""courtesy is a lady's armor,"" and that blabbering out her thoughts (like in the show) is not good politics. As evidenced in S8, show-Sansa never learned such things.

But let's talk about Cersei and why she's important. Like Sandor and Littlefinger, Cersei is frequently paired up with Sansa during her captivity in King's Landing. Also like Sandor and Littlefinger, Cersei is very much a disappointed idealist:

&gt;""When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart. Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other's clothes and spend a whole day each as the other. Yet even so, when Jaime was given his first sword, there was none for me. 'What do I get?' I remember asking. We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime's lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood."" 

Cersei is perhaps not entirely a proto-feminist (but rather a woman who internalizes the gender culture while still resenting it), but I do think we can see somewhat of a young idealist in this quote. It's hard to say if giving Cersei a sword would have softened or butterflied her later crimes (probably not), yet I don't think it's far-fetched to suggest that her hardened stance as an adult is carried over from her childhood.

Cersei spends a lot of time lecturing Sansa, not entirely unlike Sandor, only letting compassion slipping through on the rarest of moments (their conversation about Joffrey after Sansa's first menstruation being the prime example). Like Sandor and Littlefinger, it is not enough for Cersei to be a disappointed idealist; she must be certain other idealists become disappointed as well, lest the reveal the fraudulence of her own hypocrisy.

Time will tell, but I doubt we will see book-Sansa ever express the kind of views her show-counterpart expresses. Sansa may not reach out Cersei, but neither will Cersei end up having the major influence on her that the show claimed will have.

After all, this is the same show that had Sansa claim that, without Ramsay or Littlefinger, she'd still be a ""little bird."" Littlefinger (and Sandor and Cersei) are important pieces to Sansa's future evolution, but they are cautionary tales, not inspirational idols.

**Conclusion**

In this post, I've made the argument that, while Sansa must cast off her initial naivety for wiser ways, her trajectory is not leading her into becoming darker and more cynical, but rather a disappointed idealist who refuses to throw away her ideals, ultimately ending with her becoming the Queen of Love.",asoiaf,Sansa and the Burdens of the Disappointed Idealists [Spoilers EXTENDED]
1267,"One of my favorite parts of of the grayness of the ASOIAF are the outlaws, robber knights and robin hood type characters that have existed in it. And how the lines on who exactly the outlaws are can be easily blurred:

&gt;""That turned the whole world on its head. **We'd been sent out by the King's Hand to deal with outlaws, you see, but now we were the outlaws, and Lord Tywin was the Hand of the King.** There was some wanted to yield then, but Lord Beric wouldn't hear of it. We were still king's men, he said, and these were the king's people the lions were savaging. If we could not fight for Robert, we would fight for them, until every man of us was dead. And so we did, but as we fought something queer happened. For every man we lost, two showed up to take his place. A few were knights or squires, of gentle birth, but most were common men—fieldhands and fiddlers and innkeeps, servants and shoemakers, even two septons. Men of all sorts, and women too, children, dogs . . ."" -ASOS, Arya III

**With this in mind, I thought it would be interesting to come up with a list and some thoughts on different outlaws/groups of outlaws in ASOIAF**

***

#Groups

**The Kingswood Brotherhood**

The Kingswood Brotherhood existed during the Mad King's reign and is where Jaime Lannister earned his stripes. Characters like Ulmer (on the Wall) fought for them and they were led by Simon Toyne and had their own version of the Mountain in the [Smiling Knight](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/es0g62/fununlikely_theory_the_smiling_knights_identity/):

&gt;""The Smiling Knight?"" She sounded lost. ""Who was that?""

&gt;**The Mountain of my boyhood. Half as big but twice as mad**. -AFFC, Jaime IV

and especially Wenda the White Fawn:

&gt;""A woman?"" He would have thought that the White Fawn would have taught Merrett to stay clear of outlaw wenches. ""There was a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood as well.""

**""I know of her."" How not, her tone suggested, when she left her mark upon my husband?** ""The White Fawn was young and fair, they say. This hooded woman is neither. The peasants would have us believe that her face was torn and scarred, and her eyes terrible to look upon. They claim she led the outlaws."" -AFFC, Jaime IV

and:

&gt;""You fought against the Kingswood Brotherhood together,"" sniffed Lady Amerei. ""Father used to tell me stories.""

&gt;Father used to boast and lie, you mean. ""We did."" **Frey's chief contributions to the fight had consisted of contracting the pox from a camp follower and getting himself captured by the White Fawn. The outlaw queen burned her sigil into his arse before ransoming him back to Sumner Crakehall. Merrett had not been able to sit down for a fortnight**, though Jaime doubted that the red-hot iron was half so nasty as the kettles of shit his fellow squires made him eat once he was returned. Boys are the cruelest creatures on the earth. He slipped his golden hand around his wine cup and raised it up. ""To Merrett's memory,"" he said. It was easier to drink to the man than to talk of him. -AFFC, Jaime IV

They were defeated when Arthur Dayne was able to gain the trust of the smallfolk:

&gt;""Good luck getting answers then,"" said Jaime. ""If you want their help, you need to make them love you. That was how Arthur Dayne did it, when we rode against the Kingswood Brotherhood. He paid the smallfolk for the food we ate, brought their grievances to King Aerys, expanded the grazing lands around their villages, even won them the right to fell a certain number of trees each year and take a few of the king's deer during the autumn. The forest folk had looked to Toyne to defend them, but Ser Arthur did more for them than the Brotherhood could ever hope to do, and won them to our side. After that, the rest was easy."" -AFFC, Jaime IV

***

**Brotherhood of the Bones**

&gt;For a century thereafter, the Basilisks were shunned. **It was not until the coming of the corsairs that men returned to the isles once again. The Qartheen pirate Xandarro Xhore was the first to raise his banner there, using the stones he found on Ax Isle to erect a grim black fort above his anchorage. The men of the Brotherhood of Bones soon followed, settling at the western end of the chain upon the Isle of Flies. From these bases, Xandarro and the Brotherhood were perfectly placed to prey upon merchantmen rounding the shattered, smoking remnants of the Valyrian peninsula.** Within half a century, almost every one of the Basilisks was home to a nest of corsairs.

&gt;In our present day, **the Brotherhood of Bones is long forgotten**, and all that remains of Xandarro Xhore is the fort he left on Ax Isle, but the corsairs still haunt the Basilisks. Once every generation, it seems, fleets are sent to the islands to clear out these vermin of the seas. The Volantenes have been especially assiduous in this regard, often in alliance with one or more of the other Free Cities. Some of these raids have ended in failure when the corsairs fled, forewarned. Others, more ably led, have seen hundreds hanged and scores of ships seized or sunk or put to the torch. One ended in infamy, when the Lysene captain Saathos Saan, commanding the fleet sent to destroy the corsair strongholds, himself turned pirate and reigned as King of the Basilisk Isles for thirty years. -TWOIAF, Beyond the Free Cities: The Basilisk Isles

***

**The Brotherhood without Banners**

Led by Beric and later Lady Stoneheart.

Initially sent out to kill Gregor Clegane, their members include Lem Lemoncloak (probably Richard Lonmouth who was Rhaegar's squire and Robert's drinking buddy) as well as characters like:

- Anguy (bowman who won the archery competition at the Tourney of the Hand)

- Thoros (red priest)

- Tom o' Sevenstreams (currently inside Riverrun)

- Harwin

- Gendry

as well as supporters and cohorts like the Lady of the Leaves and sometimes the Ghost of High Heart.

I’ve also always wondered if Richard Lonmouth = Lem, what was he doing between Robert’s Rebellion and the War of the Five Kings?

***

**The Giant of the Trident**

Robber knight who troubled the Trident in the Riverlands during Aegon I’s reign. We don’t know his name, but he was defeated by Prince Maegor Targaryen in 31 AC. 

***

**Deserters of the Night’s Watch**

&gt;His lord father smiled. ""Old Nan has been telling you stories again. **In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile.** But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it."" -AGOT, Bran I

Lord Ryswell's youngest son is perfect example, as he and his fellow deserters were returned to the Wall and sealed in the Wall as punishment, forever known throughout [ghost stories](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/g5gi80/ghost_stories_of_ice_and_fire_spoilers_extended/) as the seventy-nine sentinels.

***

**Harren the Red**

&gt;The first of these was the bandit and outlaw named Harren the Red, who claimed to be a grandson of Harren the Black. With the help of a castle servant, Harren the Red seized both Harrenhal and its current ruler, the infamous Lord Gargon (remembered as Gargon the Guest for his custom of attending every wedding in his domain to exercise his right to First Night). Lord Gargon was gelded in the castle's godswood and left to bleed to death while Red Harren proclaimed himself Lord of Harrenhal and King of the Rivers.

He was later killed by Bernarr Brune, a squire to the Hand of the King, Alyn Stokeworth. After Harren slew Alyn, Bernarr avenged him, earning a knighthood.

***

**Aegon Frey**

Aegon Bloodborn is the eldest son of Aenys Frey and Tyana Wylde. He became an outlaw according to the AFFC, Appendix.

***

**Ser Joffrey Doggett**

Also known as the Red Dog of the Hills. He led the Poor Fellows against Maegor, but was later named to Jaehaerys. 

A perfect example of how relative the term outlaw is.

***

**Black Robin**

Black Robin was the leader of an outlaw band. There is a song called “The Day They  Hanged Black Robin”.

If you are interested I theorized about Robin’s identity a bit [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/g622e5/the_day_they_hanged_black_robin_spoilers_extended/)

***

**The Vulture King**

Some of the vulture kings can be seen more as rebels then true outlaws, it should be pointed out.

This is somewhat of a [legacy character](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/by8rzi/legacy_characters_in_asoiaf_spoilers_extended/) but there have been 4 Vulture Kings. 

The [first](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vulture_King_(Aenys_I)) was a Dornish outlaw who gathered thousands of supporters during the Second Dornish War.

The [second](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vulture_King_(Jaehaerys_I)) only had a few hundred followers and they were known more for robbery and rape.

The [third](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vulture_King_(Aegon_II)) was active during the Dance of the Dragons.

The [fourth](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vulture_King_(Daeron_II)) lived during the reign of Daeron II (amid the Blackfyre rebellions) and was killed by Lords Dondarrion/Caron.

***

**Borys Baratheon**

Borys turned outlaw after his brother had a child and he was no longer heir to Storm's End during the reign of Jaehaerys I. This led to him joining with the second Vulture King.

***

**Walter Wyl**

Joined with the Vulture King during the Second Dornish War. Had his hands and feet removed by Orys Baratheon as usury for his father (The Wyl of Wyl).

***

**Broken Men**

I just wanted an excuse to include this awesome passage:

&gt;""Ser? My lady?"" said Podrick. **""Is a broken man an outlaw?""**

&gt;""More or less,"" Brienne answered.

&gt;Septon Meribald disagreed. ""More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They've heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.

&gt;""Then they get a taste of battle.

&gt;""For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they've been gutted by an axe.

&gt;""They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that's still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

&gt;""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the worl

&gt;""And the man breaks.

&gt;""He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them . . . but he should pity them as well."" -AFFC, Brienne V

You could probably also technically consider groups like **Mountain's Men or the **Brave Companions** as outlaws, even if they currently don't have that exact title.

**Other Characters**

There are also plenty of well known characters who can be considered outlaws for their actions:

- Sandor Clegane (robbery)

- Davos Seaworth (smuggler)

- Tristan Rivers (exiled outlaw)

- Gerold Dayne (on the run for attack on Myrcella)

- Brynden Tully (fled Riverrun)

But my goal here was to focus more on actual outlaw groups, etc.

***
 
Just a summary of some of the more known outlaws from the ASOIAF universe. Im sure I missed one or two.

I'd say my biggest takeaway is outside of the worst crimes, the term ""outlaw"" is relative depending on who is in power and rebels, etc. can be considered outlaws, while they consider the ""true knights"", etc. the real outlaws.

1269,"This is not a well thought out post (argument?). Just something I thought about last night. 

If Jon is a Targaryen, will he ever desire the throne? We see that he clearly can be ambitious when he desires Winterfell and low key wants to run away with Ygritte. But, I think this ambition is more so wanting to fit in, prove a point, and make Ned proud rather than lusting for power. Furthermore, Jon never wanted to be Lord Commander, an arguably less prestigious role than Lord Paramount of the North. He only took the role out of much coaxing by his peers and feeling obligated to protect the realm and the innocents. 

This leads me to believe that Jon will never sit on the throne. He is one of my favorite characters and I want to see his story end well, but I don’t think it’s in his nature to ever want to rise that high. However, if Jon is resurrected, this could change (Beric and Catelyn became completely different people).

1276,"# Introduction

Stemming from the thought of how Arthur Dayne may be based on King Arthur, I expanded the idea to look for parallels between other Arthurian artifacts/characters and those in asoiaf.

# Arthur Dayne &amp; King Arthur

Does anyone think Arthur Dayne is based on King Arthur? I mean, it is difficult not to associate a knight with this name from a fantasy series with King Arthur, given the many references to the Arthurian legends in fantasy books. On top of being a king, Arthur is depicted to be a great warrior and knight with good virtues. These features are in line with the descriptions of Arthur Dayne by other people in the world of asoiaf.

# Dawn &amp; Excalibur (Lightbringer?)

If Arthur Dayne is based on King Arthur, his sword, Dawn, would most likely be based on Excalibur. There makes things very interesting. Especially in older tales, Excalibur is a magic sword mentioned to shine and blaze when it is drawn or used, ""When Arthur drew it from the scabbard, it cast a great light as if two torches had been kindled there.^(1) "" This is in line with the descriptions of the real Lightbringer. This may serve as another evidence supporting the theory that Lightbringer is Dawn.

# Excalibur's Scabbard

Besides its glow and sharpness, another feature of Excalibur which makes it distinct from other swords is its scabbard. The scabbard is mentioned to have protective powers which keep the wielder from losing blood. Is it possible that the scabbard made it into asoiaf?

# The Other Wielder of Excalibur

Now that we have established Excalibur=Lightbringer=Dawn in this post, let us examine who else, other than King Arthur, has used the legendary sword. This may give us hints as to who would wield Lightbringer in future. In several early French works, Excalibur is also used by Gawain. Generally, Gawain is depicted as a handsome and courteous knight with excellent skills. In certain tales, however, he is a symbol of the unfitness of secular knighthood and responsible for the deaths of many of his fellow Knights in the Round Table. He is also mentioned in some tales to be the slayer of King Pellinor^(2), making him a kingslayer. (Granted, Pellinor is not the king he serves, but you get what I am going for.)

# Jaime Lannister &amp; Gawain (Successor to Dawn?)

In asoiaf, Jaime is a knight who is handsome, nonreligious, known for his fighting skills and responsible for kingslaying. These features are in line with those regarding Gawain mentioned above. Therefore, it is possible that Jaime wields Dawn/Lightbringer in the future, thus succeeding the title 'Sword of the Morning'. Besides, I personally believe Jaime's knighting ceremony may be something of greater implication, e.g. a ritual determining the succession of Dawn and 'Sword of the Morning'.

&gt;*When* ***dawn*** *came his knees were raw and bloody.*  
*All knights must bleed, Jaime, Ser Arthur Dayne had said, when he saw.* *Blood is the seal of our devotion.*  
*With dawn he tapped him on the shoulder; the pale blade was so sharp that even that light touch cut through Jaime’s tunic, so he bled anew.*  
Jaime I (AFFC)

I do not think this word choice (in bold) is a coincidence. Besides, House Dayne has first men ancestry. Blood plays an important part in the rituals of the first men. As such, the knighting (using Dawn) may have something more to it.

# Rhaegar Targaryen &amp; Tristan

This is not related to any unconfirmed theories, but interesting nonetheless. Sir Tristan is a member of the Round Table and a good friend of King Arthur. He is a figure of tragic romance who is also known for his skill with the harp. Tristan fell in love with Iseult, who was about to marry his uncle, King Mark. He was eventually killed by the enraged King Mark for the affair. Likewise, Prince Rhaegar was friends with Arthur Dayne. He was known for playing the harp, eloped with Lyanna and killed by her enraged fiance, Robert.

# Lancel Lannister &amp; Lancelot

Mentioned by u/User_26 in a previous post. Basically, OP theorized that Lancelot is the namesake of Lancel, and some of his actions are akin to those performed by the Arthurian knight. It would be nice checking out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gsty12/spoilers_extended_a_random_parrallel_involving/) if you are interested.

# Conclusion

I believe the Arthurian legends to be an influence on George when creating asoiaf. In particular, Arthur Dayne is based on King Arthur and Dawn is based on Excalibur. On top of those mentioned in the above paragraphs, there may be some other parallels worth investigating. They may help cement certain theories and increase their credibility.

I personally wouldn't like that story wise and if true I doubt there would be any way to confirm it in the story other than through hints and circumstantial evidence since nearly everyone involved is dead.

However, it'd be an interesting parallel to Jon;

However, they do not completely overwrite this animal or person's consciousness in this state; rather, their essences blend, but the original skinchanger's memory will slowly fade until it ceases to exist.

It is very probable that Jon Snow's spirit/consciousness/what-have-you will survive in Ghost until he can be resurrected. His body will likely be preserved in the ice of the Wall to prevent decomposition; his physical brain, then, shouldn't suffer the same harm that Stoneheart's and Beric's have.

But how long can Jon's essence last inside of Ghost before he ceases to be Jon? Orell's memories seemed to stay with his eagle for a long time. Was it weeks or months between Jon killing Orell in the Skirling Pass and the eagle clawing his eyes out? Even Varamyr mentions that he could feel Orell's  presence in the eagle when he took it over.

I think we can all agree that Jon will be changed in some manner when he returns to life in his own body. But to what extent? How long will he be left as a wolf? How much of a wolf will he become?

1288,"There are several good reasons why he didn't, I suppose. Robb needed to stay close because he was going to grow up to be Lord of Winterfell. Bran and Rickon were too young and the girls are girls (though Ned and Robert were fostered circa age 8, and plans were made to foster Lysa's son, who was only 6 at the time. Also, it's not unheard of to foster female children in Westeros). Catelyn might have forbade it, but she also tried to stop Bran from going to see the Night's Watch deserter beheaded, and tried to prevent both Sansa and Arya from going South, but Ned got his way each time.

It seems strange to me that Ned never thinks about the possibility of fostering his children. He himself is fostering Theon Greyjoy (albeit Theon is also a hostage). And Ned's time in fostering was crucial to his development: Jon Arryn and Robert Baratheon became like family to him, with Robert being like a brother. Not to mention the strong ties that then formed between their three Houses.

Do Ned's reasons for not wanting or considering to foster his children extend beyond the reasons I listed above? Did he just want to practice isolationism and ""bury his head in the snow"" following Robert's Rebellion? Despite participating in them, did he grow to resent his father's ""Southron ambitions?"" Or was it a case of there simply not being any prospective families with children close to the ages of his own children?

**Notes on the New Version**

There are major changes in many sections, which I can’t point one by one. It is better to read this version as brand new.

Those who read my outline for the first time might be confused about some of the early chapters not matching the sample TWoW chapters released by GRRM. It was mentioned in the earlier versions but I will briefly explain it again. Originally, I left these sample chapters as they are. After a couple of versions, I decided to trim and combine these sample chapters, most of which were actually meant for AFfC/ADwD, hence sharing their slow pace. TWoW needs a very fast pacing. A lot of ground has to be covered. I combined Barristan I &amp; II into a single chapter. Similarly, Tyrion I &amp; II, Arianne I &amp; II and Victarion I &amp; II became single chapters each.

There are total 75 chapters without the Prologue and the Epilogue. 5 POVs (Hotah, Barristan, Asha, Mel, Victarion), 3 direwolves (Ghost, Shaggydog, Summer), 3 Sandsnakes (Obara, Tyene, Nym) and lots of known characters die in this outline.

**Prologue**

The rescue attempt fails and Edmure is slain.

**Barristan I**

Barristan makes his battle plans. He sounds the attack at dawn. All goes well. The Windblown turn their cloaks and attack the slavers.

**Theon I**

Preps for the Battle on Ice.

**Victarion I**

Victarion convinces the red shirts to blow the horn. He smears his blood over it. Iron Fleet joins the battle. Kraken and dragon banners fly. Victarion spots Rhaegal circling above.

**Asha I**

Theon is brought before the weirwood tree. He confesses the truth about the boys he killed. His story is confirmed. Theon asks to take the black. Stannis spares Theon and sends him to the Wall along with Massey’s party. Many days pass before the battle starts. Cold count skyrockets. Starvation and cannibalism run rampart. The morale in the camp dips. Desertions start, especially among the Karstark and Peasebury men. Finally, Freys arrive. Battle on Ice starts. Frey vanguard easily breaks the hungry and weak ranks of Stannis. The host of Stannis is routed. Survivors flee all over the frozen lakes. Freys give them chase. This is when the ice breaks. Both the fleeing men and their pursuers drown by the hundreds. Freys still have their reserves and supply train intact. Asha spots the Manderly knights charging to battle. She thinks all is lost.

**Tyrion I**

They learn about the Windblown treachery, Barristan’s charge and the ironmen attacking the slavers with dragon banners. The Second Sons turn their cloaks again. Tyrion hears a creepy horn blowing thrice.

**Victarion II**

Rhaegal lands after the horn is blown. Victarion orders his men to feed pigs to the dragon. Victarion gets on Rhaegal’s back. A brief flight with Victarion. The Battle of Fire is won.

**Jaime I**

Jaime gets mad when Brienne tells him the truth. After a heated discussion, they decide to free the captives and run. While they wait for a proper moment to attempt the rescue, they go over every detail Brienne can remember. They conclude that Brienne never had a real lead on Sansa. Moreover, they piece together that the silent gravedigger at the Quiet Isle is Sandor Clegane and he might know where the real Arya went. The opportunity for saving Pod and Hunt comes when most of the brotherhood goes to join the rescue mission for Edmure as mentioned in the Prologue. They find out that Hunt is already executed. Brienne and Jaime manage to free Pod.

**Bran I**

Bran improves his skills and some cave stuff happens.

**Mel I**

Mel fails to find Jon after the Shieldhall speech. No one knows where he is or what happened to him. Ghost is missing too, along with Val and a bunch of wildlings. Next morning, Marsh declares that Jon deserted and became an oathbreaker. Marsh sends letters to other castles and northern lords, declaring Jon’s desertion and asking them to catch and execute him. Fearing that Castle Black is no longer safe, Mel retreats to Nightfort with Team Selyse.	

**Davos I**

Davos comes to Skagos. Complications arise. Neither Osha nor the Skagosi find him trustworthy. Davos is thrown to a dungeon.

The power vacuum at the Vale and the chaos at the Realm is noted. Stannis declares his intention to lead a military campaign to bring the Vale under his rule, which naturally requires the Manderly Fleet and an army of northmen to crew it. The northmen are not willing to follow him in this campaign. Robb’s Will and the survival of Bran complicate the matter. Jon proposes to take Summer and lead a ranging party to bring Bran back. If the ranging party misses the deadline, they will all be assumed dead along with Bran. Rickon will then be declared the Lord of Winterfell and the northmen will follow Stannis into war.

They get the news that Stannis is alive and well in the north contrary to the prior reports of his defeat and death. Brienne tells Arya about her vows and Lady Stoneheart. They discuss what to do next. Arya and Sandor decide to go and find Lady Stoneheart. Brienne decides that she can’t do anything about Sansa, nor can she go with Arya. It falls on Jaime to protect Sansa whereas Arya should safely reach Lady Stoneheart with Sandor. That leaves only one way for Brienne. She gets on a ship bound for north where she means to slay Stannis and avenge Renly.

**Mel III**

The ranging begins. They are well provisioned and well prepared against the enemy because they know what to expect. As soon as they pass beyond the Wall, Benjen approaches and takes the lead. It is implied that Benjen has become a wight like Coldhands. They have few problems on the way to the cave. The wights try to ambush them at the mouth of the caves. They all flee into the warded space except for Benjen. Just like GRRM concealed Dany’s actual thought process in the liberation of Astapor chapter until the dracarys moment despite we were in her POV, he will do the same trick in this chapter. Mel previously had the vision of Bloodraven and Bran (who appeared to be a boy with a wolf’s head), which she misinterpreted as the servants of the enemy. In the council, Mel saw Bran’s wolf and learned that Bran has been hiding in a cave. Mel noticed that Meera was not telling the full story. On top of that, Mel had a vision of Jon where “he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again”. Moreover, they are travelling to the champion of the enemy under the leadership of a wight. Mel concludes that the Starks are evil, Bran is the wolf-headed boy in her vision who has become a servant to the enemy, and Jon too is becoming a servant of the enemy based on that wolf transformation vision. Mel’s true purpose is to slay the champions of the Great Other even if it means her own life. As soon as Mel sees Bloodraven, she starts a huge fire with her magic and powders, burning weirwood roots and anyone who is caught up in the fire. Val strikes her down with a sword she finds in the cave. Mel dies in peace, thinking that she made a huge service to her god and his savior by dealing this huge blow to the enemy.

In their absence, they were all presumed dead, Rickon was declared the Lord of Winterfell and Stannis took the remaining strength of the North to a campaign in the south. While they are waiting for news from Stannis, they unearth proofs for RLJ(A) from Lyanna’s tomb. Bran sends a raven to the Neck and summons Howland Reed to bring Ned’s bones for proper burial.

The Dothraki will avoid engaging with them and ride hard for Volantis. Victarion is supposed to bring the fleet to the harbor and attack Volantis when the riders reach the city walls. While waiting for the sign to attack, Victarion wants to do another blood smearing but the horn is missing. Victarion is frightened. The sign comes and Victarion gives the order to sail. When he tries to mount Rhaegal, the dragon senses his fear. The second “Oh.”

**Dany IV**

There are just two planned books left in the series to wrap up ASOIAF and so many plotlines to wrap up, including the more central arcs concerning the upcoming invasions of the Others and Daenerys Targaryen, other key plots such as the Starks returning to Winterfell, the endgame schemes of Littlefinger and Varys and the Meereenese Knot, and then countless other plot-lines introduced in the series from the most prominent of the Valonquar question to the fate of the enslaved Wildlings headed for Braavos to what happened to Benjen Stark and then even lesser important but still noteworthy plots like the fate of the Ironborn after Euron's invasion of Westeros, fulfillment of Quaithe's prophecies and whether or not Ashara Dayne is still alive. 

In short, there is so much to wrap up in just two books, so many mysteries and unanswered questions to answer, so many places George has promised we'll see in the books one day like Casterly Rock and Highgarden to visit, so many conflicts and wars to see wrapped up etc. that I feel like one of the two following scenarios will have to happen;

1.) At least one more book will have to be written alongside the upcoming two, this one doesn't seem as appealing and likely given how long it has taken George eleven years to write the current TWOW and still hasn't finished. 

2.) A lot of plot is going to have to be cut and wrapped up quickly within the next two books.

I'm personally leaning more towards the second scenario being the only viable option.

So when it comes to the next two books, which fan theories do you personally believe are canon, which are likely to happen and which side plots do you think stand a chance to be cut?

The first that stands out to me is the Meereeneese Knot - with regards to Daenerys, she has to have her story in Meereen wrapped up, invading Westeros, fight the Others, fall in love with Jon Snow and if the show is anything to go by die and lose her war within the span of just two books; thats quite a lot of story and things to move through so quickly within just two books. There are still lingering questions in the plot of Meereen, like who is leading the Sons of the Harpy, who poisoned the Locusts, how will the plague in Meereen end, who are the figures presented in Quaithe's prophecies to Daenerys etc. It just feels like so much to get done for Daenerys' arc within two books that I think its possible that Daenerys will just return to Meereen in one or two POV chapters and choose to either abandon it completely or burn it done 'Three fires you will light, one for death.'

The second is whats going on with the Faceless Men - what Jacquen is up to in Oldtown, what might the Faceless Men have planned for Daenerys, their future in the series etc. It feels like the series has built them up to be a massive game changer in the plot and to have so much power to change things going forward but beyond Arya's character arc they haven't achieved much. But then again, with them only being based in Braavos and not directly connected to the plot of the Others, Daenerys or the Westerosi houses I'm not so sure that they're a necessity to wrap up before the series ends.

Then there are also a lot of fan supported conspiracies in ASOIAF that are currently unconfirmed - the Grand Northern Conspiracy, the Dornish Master Plan, the Grand Maester Conspiracy in killing off dragons, the Grand Tyrell Conspiracy, Littlefinger's Debt Scheme etc. - all that have a lot of excellent evidence backing their well crafted arguments for what *has* happened in the series and should be confirmed for the readers before the series ends.

Finally, there's lingering questions and additional beliefs as to characters' hidden heritages or identities that could be further explored or answered but not necessarily needed for the lot and I have to wonder whether will just be left ignored or not - are any of Tywin's children Targaryens, was he the former Hand that built an underground tunnel to Chataya's Tunnel, was he poisoned before he died and who by, whose voice did Varys hear in the flames, will Cleganebowl happen or Krakenbowl or Honourbowl etc.? Who is the Hooded Man in Winterfell, what happened to Ashara Dayne, in short so many lingering questions about the very lore behind ASOIAF and what transpired before the series even began that just seems impossible to wrap up in just two books.

**TLDR: After spending the last five years investing myself in amazing fan theories for the series I feel that I've raised my expectations too high for the series to be fully wrapped up in just two more books and have to wonder if we should lower our expectations for the next two books or debunk any lingering questions or theories.**",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Extended) With just two books left, should we lower our expectations for TWOW?"

""The oarsmen were all big. One was a boy, one a brute, one a bastard’s bastard.""

\-Victarion I TWOW

This line has been bothering me for a few days. At first it looks like Victarion has chosen these epithets because theyre physical descriptions of the men, and he certainly has for the first two. But ""Bastard's Bastard"" isn't a physical description; it's a reference to heredity. Now, it's possible that this is just a way of saying he is lowborn but we've never heard it used before. Plus, it is likely that the other thralls are lowborn as well, so it wouldn't be a good way of distinguishing him from the other two. Again, Victarion chose these epithets to tell these thralls apart without learning their names, so it's likely that the boy and the brute aren't bastard's bastards.

So what is a bastard's bastard? Well, a bastard is a child born out of wedlock who is given a generic surname. However, the child must have at least one highborn parent; common folk in westeros don't seem to have last names so any children they produce out of wedlock won't even get the generic last names of noble bastards. So if this is the case, what is a bastard's bastard? The simple answer is that they're nobody. Bastards are only important because of their tenuous connection to a noble and bastard's bastards are even further removed. That is, unless they're the child of a bastard and another noble. We see a couple examples of nobles taking bastards as their paramours, the most prominent being Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand. This would explain the epithet given by Victarion: he may be vaguely aware of this guy's parentage. Not enough that he actually learned the guy's name (which is definitely ""\_\_\_ Pyke"") but enough that his ""bastard's bastard"" nickname is distinct to this guy.

Going further, there are actually bastard's bastards at three of the four battles at the beginning of TWOW. In addition to Victarion's bastard's bastard in Mereen, Arianne has Elia Sand in her party as she heads to the Stormlands and Euron has Falia Flowers with him in the Reach. Elia is a bastard's bastard through her mother Ellaria, a bastard daughter of the Ullers. We have no information on Falia's mother so we can't say whether she's a bastards bastard, but we know shes pregnant with Euron's child which makes that fetus a bastard's bastard. The only battle that doesn't have a bastard's bastard is the fight up north: the only bastard there I can think of is Ramsey. It is possible that he's a bastard's bastard since we know little about his mother, but we can't assume. That being said, it would be very interesting since right now Ramsey is looking pretty friendless in the North. It would be cool if he had a secret connection to another house that Roose didn't know about.",asoiaf,[Spoilers TWOW] Bastard's Bastards at the battles in TWOW

&gt; madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.

(ASOS, Daenerys VI)

I posit that they are often the same side. Sometimes, a Targaryen who seemed destined for greatness in their youth turns to madness in old age. Examples include Aegon V, who caused Summerhall, and Aerys II, who was a vigorous and ambitious man when he ascended the Iron Throne. Some Targaryens, such as Maegor, Daemon (husband of Rhaenyra), and Aemond can be considered great and mad at the same time.

Apart from dragonriding, one feature of Targaryens is prophetic dreams, often involving dragons.  They often know that their dreams come true. While Daenys accurately predicted the doom, many have been mislead by their visions. Examples include Daeron (son of Maekar) foreseeing Dunk killing a ""dragon"", and Daemon II dreaming of a dragon rising from Whitehall. 

Targaryen madness also often involves an obsession with dragons. For example, Aegon IV made wooden ""dragons"" that spouted wildfire, Aerion drank wildfire to try to turn himself into a dragon, Aegon V killed himself and several of his family in an effort to hatch dragon eggs at Summerhall, and Aerys planned to burn down the city, believing he would rise as a dragon.

I believe that all these acts of madness were inspired by dragon dreams.

My theory is that one common theme in Targaryen dreams is the final battle between dragons and Others, similar to what Dany dreams:

&gt;That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident. But she was mounted on a dragon, not a horse. When she saw the Usurper's rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.

(ASOS, Daenerys III)

Dreams like this might have been the reason Aegon conquered Westeros, and why Jaehaerys and Alysanne flew North, and Alysanne was greatly disturbed when her dragon refused to cross the Wall. 

After the extinction of the dragons, when Targaryens dreamt of themselves or their descendants, saving Westeros on dragonback, it must have chipped at their sanity, since they knew their dreams usually came true. This is why they eventually turned completely mad, and tried to hatch or recreate dragons by drastic means.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) How dreams lead Targaryens from greatness to madness
1310,"The wall was built to protect humans from WW at some point after the end of the long night and the construction might have lasted at least decades if not more so It doesn't seem like an accident that a group of humans stayed there.

Could they have been left behind on purpose as a punishment for some betrayal they committed in the long night?

Or as part of a deal  ? like some sort of cattle for the WW  along with certain babies being passed by the Nights Watch in secret tunnels.

Do they willingly  decided to go there  because they didn't want to form part of this new society and have to bow to a Stark King, so they went beyond the Wall ?( even if there are ice demons who want to murder you there).

Do they crossed  years later for another reason not related to the long night?

I know we only have speculation, but I wonder if there's a clue somewhere in the books about what really happened. There are hints about special bloodlines that the WW seems to want ( Craster babies) and the Wildlings in all this time have never really developed a proper civilization beyond the wall, so it seems like they were not really prepared for willingly establish there.

1316,"I'm rereading the books now and it seems like every time a septa character appears, they have super ugly names that sound like diseases, etc. or that incorporate the ""mor"" sound/syllable derived from ""mortem,"" ""death"" in Latin.

E.g.
Mordane
Lemore 
Scolera (sounds like cholera)
Nysterica (sounds like hysterical)
Unella 
Moelle 
Roelle 

These just aren't very pretty/feminine names. And we never seem to see septas with ""prettier"" names like e.g. septa Arianne, septa Sansa, septa Margaery. Every family wants to give their child an aesthetically pleasing name, and I can't see any family deliberately naming a kid something like Scolera or Nysterica. Just as we in the 21st century English speaking world would never give our kids names like Bertha, Ethel, Gertrude, etc. because they sound so ""ugly"" to our ears. So do you think they pick/get assigned new names to replace their given name when they become septas, as like a humility thing, same as how they dress plain and stuff to avoid ""vanity"" etc.?

This is just my own speculation, pretty sure there's no info in the text that would prove or disprove it.

1319,"The War of the Five Kings is over in all but name. Rob Stark and Renly Baratheon are dead, but Balon Greyjoy and Stannis Baratheon still claim to be Kings, leaving the North and the Iron Islands in a 5 year-long stalemate with the Iron Throne. With Tywin Lannister dead, there is little desire - or ability - for the houses of Lannister and Tyrrell to march against the rebels.

**SANSA**

She spends 5 years as Alayne in the Eyrie, learning scheming, plotting, and politics from one of the best game players out there, Littlefinger. She marries Harry the heir, putting the Vale, the North, and the Riverlands in the circle of Littlefingers influence. We're reintroduced to her showcasing her new game playing abilities. Littlefinger plots to reignite the War.

**ARYA**

She spends 5 years training to become a Faceless Man in the House of Black and White. By this time she's pretty much mastered becoming a magical super-assassin. We're reintroduced to her demonstrating her new assassin powers, gifting mercy to an unsuspecting victim across the Narrow Sea.

**BRAN**

He spends 5 years inside that cave with Bloodraven. He's almost ready to become the new TER, but still has a way to go. We're reintroduced to him mid weirwood vision, only at the end of the chapter is it confirmed to be Bran - and he's seen a vision that he must act on.

**JON**

He spends 5 years as Lord Commander of the Nights Watch, becoming frustrated with the politics that comes along with it, but learing a great deal. Stannis and the wildlings are settled along all the castles of the Wall, and some of the Gift. The north is in a kind of stalemate; the Bolton's still hold Winterfell. We're reintroduced to Jon as he deals with insurrection in his ranks - many of his commanders are becoming dangerously unhappy with the wildling presence.

**STANNIS**

After defeating the Wilding army and giving Mance Rayder to the Red God, Stannis realises he doesn't have the strength to march south. He continues to call himself King of Westeros. He licks his wounds, and bides his time garrisoning the castles of the Wall, plotting with certain Northern lords to overthrow the Bolton's. As we're reintroduced to him, the Grand Northern Stalemate is nearly at an end - and war is nearly upon us.

**DAVOS**

Davos spends 5 years running errands of Stannis: treating with the Iron Bank, Myrish pirates, Tyroshi sellsword companies, and Northern Lords alike, attempting to gain support for Stannis. We're reintroduced to him as he learns the truth about the Stark boys.

**THEON**

He's introduced in much the same way as before, except he's just spent longer in captivity to Ramsay: 5 years, living as Reek. Everyone assumes him dead. We're reintroduced to him as he witnesses something that causes him remember his old identity.

**SAMWELL**

He's spent 5 years Maester-training in the Citedal, and has forged all sorts of links in his chain. Before he can return to Castle Black a fully qualified Maester, however, he must forge one final link: the link of Valyrian steel for the ""higher mysteries"". While training under Marywn the Mage, Sam learns a secret that forces him to head North once again, as he sets sail from Oldtown, he notices a strange ship with black sails and a dark red hull in the docks.

**ASHA/AERON/VICTARION - merging these for a single Greyjoy perspective.**

Balon Greyjoy continues to call himself King of the Iron Islands and the North, though his claim to the North is basically non-existent. The Iron Islands remain in a stalemate with the Iron Throne, neither are making moves against the other as autumn is nearly at an end. But the Iron Islanders, those warrior people, are getting restless and are itching for war.

We're reintroduced to ASHA/AERON/VICTARION as King Balon dies in a mysterious way, falling off a rope bridge during a storm. Aeron calls a kingsmoot,  and a long lost nuncle shows up again at Pyke. Euron Crowseye arrives on his red decked ship to spark the Iron Islands back into open war, and reveals the existence of a Dragon Queen far in the east.

**DAENERYS**

She spends 5 years learning how to rule Mereen. This is a kind of internship for her, learning to be a queen. She's married Hizdar. Rhaegal and Viserion are still locked up, and Drogon is still loose - all have grown significantly. Mereen is largely peaceful while Hizdar is King, but tension bubbles under the surface. We're reintroduced to Dany as pressure mounts on her to reopen the Great Pit of Daznak for her 5 year wedding anniversary.

**TYRION**

After killing Tywin and fleeing Westeros, Tyrion has spent 5 years travelling the free cities and further east. He's eventually taken into slavery by Yezzan so Qagazz, and we are reintroduced to him as he trains to perform at the Great Pit of Daznak, in front of thousands of Mereenese.

**JAIME**

He's spent 5 years running errands for Cersei: he's lead half assed attempts to retake the Riverlands and the Iron Islands, and has grown apart from Cersei as she descends into madness. He doesn't know what he wants anymore. We catch up with him on a mission to the Riverlands to quell the raidings of a mysterious Brotherhood. 

**BRIENNE**

She's spent 5 years searching for the Stark girls. Her first 3 years were spent scouring the Seven Kingdoms, to no avail. Her last two years were spent searching in name only. She's effectively given up hope and has begun to question her vows. We catch up with her as she gets a tip off about a Stark girl/woman leading raids with a mysterious Brotherhood.

**CERSEI**

Tommen is king but as he is not yet of age, a council of regents rules from Kings Landing. Cersei has spent 5 years in a constant power struggle with Tommen's other regents: Mace Tyrrell, Kevan Lannister, and Grand Maester Pycelle. Her mind is slowly unraveling as the change is almost upon her. She becomes increasingly jealous of the young and beautiful Margery. We're reintroduced to her as she gets wind of a new religious uprising in the capital that she feels she can use to her advantage.

**AREO/ARYS/ARIANNE - merging for a single Dorne perspective**

Doran Martell does what Doran Martell always does: wait. Dorne, like the Iron Islands, has spent 5 years waiting as tension bubbles under the surface. The Dornish want revenge for Oberyn, but Doran refuses to grant it. We're reintroduced to Dorne as we learn about a certain pact made in Bravoos decades prior.

***OVERALL***

Most of the characters have withdrawn into their own particular world's: Jon as Lord Commander, Samwell as a Maester, Arya as a Faceless Man, Sansa as Alayne, Theon as Reek, and Dany as Queen in the East.

The 5 year gap has been largely peaceful, though much tension seethes under the surface. Plots begin to quicken. We're reintroduced to Westeros as a tightly strung, highly explosive powder keg, with only a single spark needed to reignite war and chaos. 

Who will be Franz Ferdinand of this new war? Who will provide that spark? Littlefinger, Euron, Stannis, Cersei, the Sand Snakes, or someone else entirely?

1320,"Since AGOT was written about 25 years ago, there are plenty of things that have been abandoned yet still have foreshadowing, such as Jaime becoming king, and Tyrion burning Winterfell. There are also things that seem to be ""first-bookisms"" that just no longer seem relevant due to a larger scope, etc.

With this in mind we can look at things from the latter books (AFFC/ADWD/TWOIAF), as well as more importantly from The Winds of Winter, that if GRRM is mentioning at this point, probably have some relevance.

Sure he creates some red herrings, but he has had the chance to alter things and chose not to and has even doubled down on some (like rarity of valyrian steel).

**With this in mind what is something that is noted in TWOW that has you reconsidering how you previously thought things would end up, etc.?**

For me its this discussion of **the climate in Braavos**:

&gt;**""Seven hells, this place is damp,"" she heard her guard complain. ""I'm chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?""**

&gt;**""Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,""** the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. ""I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King's Landing, fool. Can't you read a bloody map?"" -TWOW, Mercy

Not that I didn't know about Braavos' climate before, just the fact that he chose to word it as such (mentioning fruit trees) when he could easily have worded it differently and still had it make sense.

So I never was a big fan of lemongate (I just thought Dany misremembered or something similar), but this quote always gives me pause.

1321,"When Victorian thinks about killing Euron, he wonders that if ordering someone to kill Euron makes him a kinslayer. This made me wonder about some of the other characters in the book and wether or not they are kinslayers.

Stannis: In my opinion, Stannis is 100% a kinslayer. He had the power to have Renly killed or not be killed, but chose for him to die. 

Daenerys: When Viserys dies, he pleads for Dany to order Khal Drogo to stop what he is doing. Dany instead says nothing and Viserys is murdered. Does this make Dany a kinslayer? I believe that if she asked Drogo is spare his life, he would have. Does watching your kin be murdered, while not doing anything make you a kinslayer? 

I think this situation parallels the Blackfish, Edmure situation. Blackfish had the power to stop Edmure from being hanged, but chose to stay inside Riverrun. In that case he called the bluff of the Freys and Jamie Lannister.  If Edmure had been hung, would Blackfish have been considered a kinslayer?

All in all, I think that Stannis and Dany should be considered kinslayers, while if Edmure had been hung, Blackfish should not be considered a kinslayer. The differences in these cases is that Dany and Stannis held the power, they were the ones that basically sentenced Viserys and Renly to die.

1325,"Hi all. 

I know a great many people are disappointed with the ending of a game of thrones, and I am too. When complaining about it someone told me to ""make a better show then"" so here I am.

The Show (and the books) and the events in them are all orchestrated by two characters, Varys and Littlefinger (Peter Baelish). The war of 5 kings is squarely the fault of little finger and the restoration of Targaryen rule in westeros is due to the schemings of Varys and his friend, Illyrio Mopatis (I know those two have a much larger plan in the books but this is strictly show related). 

Given that the events in the show started with these two men, even if the majority of watchers didn't even realise it, it seems fitting that the show should end with one final battle between these two, who are polar opposites yet admire the others. 

So, instead of Cersei and Daenerys having the great final showdown (bare in mind book Cersei is a narcissistic idiot and she is only relevant in the shows because the writers love the actress), Baelish battles with Varys.

Baelish, by the end of Season 6 has control over the vale, significant influence over the north (through sansa) and in the books, is lord paramount of the riverlands. 

Say he marches south with all the swords of those lands, by promising the Tully's will have back the river lands, by marrying sansa and simply ordering the Vale, and he also secures a loan from the iron bank akin to what stannis received, and will hire the golden company and other mercenaries. 

Littlefinger now has a massive army, can take king's landing from Cersei and have her executed. A lannister cousin like Lancel or some other relative can be placed as lord of casterly rock. 

Bare in mind that neither the stormlands, dorne or the reach will help Cersei, she has only the lannister army, which is damaged from their war with Robb stark, to defend the crown, and a city that wants her dead. 

Littlefinger crowns himself king, to the disgust and reluctant acceptance of the major houses of the realm. however, daenerys lands at dragonstone, Dorne and the Reach flock to her cause, and Baelish is immediately threatened. 

Baelish has the larger army, but Daenerys has three dragons. 

It won't come down to a fight however, or if it does it will not go in Baelish's favour, because Varys will reveal Littlefinger involvement in the death of Ned stark, the war of the 5 kings (and therefore the death of Robb and catelyn). 

Sansa will turn on baelish, and will also reveal that baelish killed lysa, causing the valemen to turn against him also. The riverlands will likely follow suit. Baelish finds himself with no friends and a lot of enemies, and is ultimately killed and replaced.

This ultimately represents how Varys makes his alliances through mutual gain and friendships, but Littlefinger exploits and manipulates people, and whilst that may allow him to have more lands and wealth than Varys will ever possess, those people he used will seize any opportunity to betray him. 

I think it would be a fitting end to the show.

Obviously then the United westerosi would match north and defeat the night king, maybe daenerys dies and Jon is crowned king out of duty.

Sure, he never really had to honor the pact unless it suited him (the only other people who know about it are a dead man Willem Darry and a dying sealord,) but if the secret ever got it, it meant his kingdom and his life.

The only way I see a guy like Doran making a wager like this is if he knows Viserys will get his army, and who knows Viserys is getting an army more than the people who facilitated it, Ilyrio and Varys. This has the added benefit of giving Doran's secret protection. Varys is one of the few people that has the resources and Essosi contacts to find out about the secret marriage pact. Has anyone else thought Dorne and Ilyrio were working with each other at all? The biggest issue here is that Doran doesn't seem to know about Aegon at all, so if they were in correspondence, Doran wasn't privy to that particular secret",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Doran and Varys
1330," In canon, the magic of the cotf broke the arm of Dorne into the  stepstones to halt the advance of the migrating first men and the same  was attempted at the neck where it wasn’t quite successful. I imagine the firstmen would still reach and settle in the North considering they also reached the barren iron isles and the fact that a swamp might be a lot harder to navigate compared to the seas. How would the event impact Northmen culture who now has no land connection to the south, would they be naval focused, maybe raiders in the winter or maybe get gold from trading with the new sea route? Can they control the neck stones (necklace? Pearls?) Would they fall in the andal invasions?

1335,"How could Jon be the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna from a genealogical perspective?

Okay, so I though of this when I was rereading Game of Thrones. We know that in the ASOIAF universe there are dominant bloodlines. For example, the Baratheons always have black hair no matter what and this information was used to help Ned figure out that the “Baratheon” children were really Lannisters. It seems, then, that the Stark line is not dominant because only Arya, out of all five of the Stark children, has the look of a Stark. The rest have the Tully look from their mother’s side. I would assume that the Targaryen bloodline is a pretty dominant one because it is the blood of the dragon and even with all of the marrying between houses, Viserys and Daenerys still looked like Old Valyrians. So how could Rhaegar, a full-blooded Targaryen, and Lyanna, born from a bloodline that is not dominant, have a child who looks like a full Stark looking at it from a genealogical perspective? I would at least think there would be a mix of characteristics from both bloodlines (maybe there is and I’m just missing something), but Jon is said to look like a Stark. I could be wrong about something but this was just an interesting thought I had.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) A thought on genes.

1343,"Every reader knows the great song, The Bear and The Maiden Fair, and everyone knows all the theories about Dany/Jorah, Jaime/Brienne.  But every single theory misses the most important point.  What exactly is honey colored hair?  Most everyone assumes honey-blond....  it’s easy to remember, it fits the theories easy, and in martins story it is indeed a type, but not the one your supposed to find.  

Dany, Jaime are red herrings.  The entire song itself is the story of TWOW.   The tourney in the Vale, most lords not selling food, the NW and wildlings and Northerners needing to buy food now that Jon has a loan...  and yes Jon is the dancing bear.  How?  He is a figuratively adopted son of Jeor Mormont.  He is given the family sword, trained as Mormonts replacement, is chosen LC after Mormonts bird chooses him....  
Jon is a bearded bear.  All black (NW black), and dark brown, hair and beard....

Who is his three companions?  Pyp, Grenn, and Edison Tollet, who has family in the vale. More than likely. So connections,  and there is one more, the goat.  

Now this one is tinfoil so far, but he is the hooded man in winterfell.  The Blackfish.  Who disappeared from the story, and has not gone to any loyal holdfasts, cannot go to the Vale....
But has been described as a goat.

Her uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper. Brynden Tully had always known how to listen … to anyone but her father. He was Lord Hoster's brother, younger by five years, but the two of them had been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember. During one of their louder quarrels, when Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden ""the black goat of the Tully flock."" Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he ought to be a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward he had taken it as his personal emblem.
AGOT Catelyn 6

In AFFC Brienne 5, the high road to the Vale is closed by now.  Leaving one loyal area, the Neck.  Where the last nobles who went south were headed to find Reed, and deliver the verbal orders.  Basically he is the reason the Frey’s disappear.  His job in Robb’s army was the outriders.  

But back to the point, honey isn’t just honey-blond.  It’s actually the color least associated with honey colored hair.  The darker the honey, the stronger the taste....  and it is shown throughout almost all the books.  Darker honey is brown and looks red in the light.  

The first time honeyed hair appears, it is a redhead.  Yes a redhead.  And tyrion knows women and women’s assets, so we should listen.....

Two other girls sat playing at tiles before a leaded glass window. The freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in her honeyed hair. The other had skin as smooth and black as polished jet, wide dark eyes, small pointed breasts.”
ACOK Tyrion 3

Freckles are a common occurrence with redheads...
But by the time we get to Tyrion 7 we have read to much and forgot when we get the actual hair color.

Is milord feeling unloved?” Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. “I have a cure for that.” Smiling, Tyrion shook his head. “You are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I’ve grown fond of Alayaya’s remedy.” “You’ve never tried mine. Milord never chooses anyone but ’Yaya. She’s good but I’m better, don’t you want to see?” “Next time, perhaps.” Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse.”
ACOK Tyrion 7

Funnily enough, she is a combination of Sansa, and Ygritte.  Long haired like Sansa, pug nose and bouncy breasts like Ygritte.   Ygritte is ACOK Jon 6 for her pug nose, shaggy mop of red hair that is messy, and ASOS Jon 3 for her breasts...

So red heads are honey colored.  And associated with blue flowers in their hair, so let’s see some other examples....

A dark young man and a pretty blonde woman were sharing a horn of mead. A pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens, while a grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat crosslegged on a pillow, playing a lute and singing:”
ASOS Jon 1. 

Val is blonde.

Val looked at him with pale grey eyes. “He always climbed too fast.” She was as fair as he’d remembered, slender, full-breasted, graceful even at rest, with high sharp cheekbones and a thick braid of honey-colored hair that fell to her waist.”
ASOS Jon 10 

Pale grey eyed, honey-colored hair.....  

Val stood beside him, tall and fair. They had crowned her with a simple circlet of dark bronze, yet she looked more regal in bronze than Stannis did in gold. Her eyes were grey and fearless, unflinching. Beneath an ermine cloak, she wore white and gold. Her honey-blond hair had been done up in a thick braid that hung over her right shoulder to her waist. The chill in the air had put color in her cheeks.”
ADWD Jon 3
Grey eyed once again.  Honey-blond hair.  

The light of the half-moon turned Val’s honey-blond hair a pale silver and left her cheeks as white as snow. She took a deep breath. “The air tastes sweet.””
ADWD Jon 8
And in the moonlight honey-blond hair is a pale silver.

Then Ghost emerged from between two trees, with Val beside him.”

“They look as though they belong together. Val was clad all in white; white woolen breeches tucked into high boots of bleached white leather, white bearskin cloak pinned at the shoulder with a carved weirwood face, white tunic with bone fastenings. Her breath was white as well … but her EYES WERE BLUE, her LONG BRAID THE COLOR OF DARK HONEY, her cheeks flushed red from the cold. It had been a long while since Jon Snow had seen a sight so lovely.”
ADWD Jon 11

And here we go, eyes are BLUE, her long braid the color of DARK HONEY.....  Jon is not seeing Val...  it’s the same thing that happens when he sees Melisandre.....  he sees who he lies to himself is Ygritte.....  but when does Ygritte have LONG reddish brown hair?  Jon knows one female with LONG REDDISH HAIR.  Who currently has CHESTNUT HAIR.    SANSA....   Martin makes a great distinction between honey in the hair, reddish, dark honey, brown and honey-blond.  You are supposed to get sucked into honey-blond and miss the true honey.

But the answer lies with Jon 6, and Ghost himself brushing against Jon, Jon is receiving visions, or glimpses of the future while still conscious.  Basically he has become one with ghost already.  It first truly started when Jon takes the new recruits to the hearttree to swear their vows.  He smells better, sees better....

In the shadow of the Wall, the direwolf brushed up against his fingers. For half a heartbeat the night came alive with a thousand smells, and Jon Snow heard the crackle of the crust breaking on a patch of old snow. Someone was behind him, he realized suddenly. Someone who smelled warm as a summer day. When he turned he saw Ygritte. She stood beneath the scorched stones of the Lord Commander’s Tower, cloaked in darkness and in memory. The light of the moon was in her hair, her red hair kissed by fire. When he saw that, Jon’s heart leapt into his mouth. “Ygritte,” he said. “Lord Snow.” The voice was Melisandre’s. Surprise made him recoil from her. “Lady Melisandre.” He took a step backwards. “I mistook you for someone else.” At night all robes are grey. Yet suddenly hers were red. He did not understand how he could have taken her for Ygritte. She was taller, thinner, older, though the moonlight washed years from her face. Mist rose from her nostrils, and from pale hands naked to the night. “You will freeze your fingers off,” Jon warned.”
ADWD JON 6

Once again the night came alive, Jon’s senses are massively increased.  He thinks Ygritte because men see what they expect to see.  Same with Sansa and her unkiss, her dream thing of Payne coming up the tower stairs.  Lady is dead yes, but notice how Martin describes her, Lady’s Shade.  A proper noun.  Not a common shade.  

And as a bonus, in the TWOW Alayne 1 chapter, Harry described his new baby momma like this:

Saffron is very beautiful, tall and slim with big brown eyes and HAIR LIKE HONEY.
Alayne raised her head,” more beautiful than me?”

Google Saffron....  it’s a red spice...  RED.  The most costly spice by weight in the world....

Now here’s Sansa described as her Alayne persona....

And at Winterfell, Sansa was a little girl with auburn hair. My daughter is a maiden tall and fair, and her hair is chestnut. Men see what they expect to see, Alayne.””
AFFC Alayne 1
It’s almost the exact same description.  Auburn Sansa is the true honey haired wench.  Who loves to dance.

And as we have been shown throughout every book, men do see what they expect to see...  especially when one is glamoured.....
And to show that really pale blond hair is not true honey, 

He doesn’t like Ned. The squire seemed nice enough to Arya; maybe a little shy, but good-natured. She had always heard that Dornishmen were small and swarthy, with black hair and small black eyes, but Ned had big blue eyes, so dark that they looked almost purple.
And his hair was a pale blond, more ash than honey.”

1353,"On a re-read of *Game* a passage in Jon I stuck out as an interesting bit of foreshadowing. During the conversation between Jon and Benjen immediately before Jon expresses his desire to join the Night's Watch, they discuss the Young Dragon:

&gt;""Daeron Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne."" Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.  
&gt;  
&gt;""A conquest that lasted a summer,"" his uncle pointed out. ""Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn't a game."" He took another sip of wine. ""Also,"" he said, wiping his mouth, ""Daeron Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that part?""

The irony of this in light of John's future is quite striking. In many ways  Jon's arc is the inverse of the Young Dragon's reign. Like Daeron, Jon rose to leadership at a young age and like Daeron, he was assassinated because of his greatest achievement. 

This got me thinking about George's tendency ti use Targaryen history as a prelude to events of ASOIAF, with the most prominent example being the Dance of Dragons presaging the struggle between the various Targaryen claimants in TWOW/ADOS.

Of course George never just retells the stories with new protagonists, rather he takes the overarching themes of the stories and remixes them into something familiar, but new.

So, is Jon's storyline a remix of the conquest of Dorne? I think perhaps it may be.

**1. Lord Commander Snow and the Young Dragon**

In broad strokes, the Young Dragon started the process which brought the peoples of the southern end of Westeros into the Targaryen realm with a great military achievement, the conquest of Dorne. However, his failure to fully anticipate what would come after the conquest led to the collapse of the conquest and his assassination. This failure however, then led his successor, Baelor the Blessed, to finally complete what Daeron started, but through a change of strategy and use peaceful means.

Similarly, Jon brought the northernmost Westerosi into the realm, not by expanding the territory of the realm, but by accepting the Wildlings into the existing lands. Unlike Daeron, Jon did not conquer the Wildlings and force them into the Seven Kingdoms against their will. Instead, he gave them what they wanted in return for their consent to live according to its laws. Thus, he chose to make peace rather than waste lives seeking a pyrrhic victory. 

However, while Jon wisely chose to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, like Daeron he failed to anticipate the consequences of the massive change he began. Because this is a remix however, it is not a failure to appreciate the Dornish independence, as Jon understands the Wildlings as well as anyone in the Watch. What he failed to appreciate was the mindset of his own men and the difficulty of adjusting to a world in which the enemy you have been fighting for millennia should now be treated as a brother. 

In short, both Jon and Daeron failed to appreciate the level of resistance there would be to their efforts to enact massive change on groups of people. Daeron's failure was his inability to understand the psychology of his enemies while Jon's failure was his inability to understand that of his own men.  As Daeron caused the rebellion of those he conquered, Jon caused the mutiny of those he led. 

Then, as a final twist to this remix Daeron was assassinated while he was attempting to negotiate peace by enemies breaking the promises of parley. By contrast, Jon was assassinated by his own men while attempting to initiate war, which was a violation of his own vows.

If Jon's arc up to the end of *Dance* reflects a remix of the Young Dragon's reign culminating in a parallel execution, then can we look to the aftermath of Daeron's assassination as a guide to how things will develop at the wall in TWOW?

I don't know, but it's fun to assume that we can and then speculate wildly!

**2. Baelor the Blessed.**

After Daeron's death, the nobles of the Six Kingdoms apparently pressed for a war of vengeance and the Hand had thrown the Dornish hostages in the dungeon to await their execution. Then a new king was crowned, Baelor the Blessed, the closest the faith of the seven has to a Christ figure.  Baelor forgave the Dornish, cancelled the execution of the hostages, then journeyed to Dorne and negotiated peace. First he traveled the Boneway to Sunspear on foot (Classic journey into the underworld and back stuff, what with the bones and sun), negotiated peace with the Prince of Dorne through a marriage pact, and then returned. On his return he entered a den of serpents to save Aemon the Dragonknight.

So the overarching themes of Baelor's peacemaking endeavors are: the rejection of the prevailing opinion of the Kingdom generally and his primary lieutenant specifically (the Hand); and the rejection of the prior strategy (the use of force to compel surrender) in favor of its opposite (the use of negotiation to seek consent). 

However, after the agreement unifying Dorne with the realm was completed, Baelor proved to be a poor leader. The very idiosyncrasies which enabled him to forge a peace undermined his ability to rule and to leave an heir. His piety led him to govern incompetently throughthe remainder of his reign and to force celibacy on his wife Daena, which arguably led her to give birth to a bastard, an even which prompted his extreme fasting and, possibly, his own death (he either starved himself or was killed by Viserys to spare the realm further misgovernance). Thus his failure to restrain his madness resulted in his undoing personally and, because that bastard was Daemon Blackfyre, the destabilization of the realm for generations.  

**3. Jon = Baelor, sort of.**

What are the similarities between Jon's return and the reign of Baelor the Blessed? I'm glad you asked.  Wait, no come back, please, I promise I'm not trolling.

* **Similar Ages**: Baelor was 17 years-old when he was crowned, Jon was (probably?) 17 years-old when he was stabbed and, therefore, will be 17 years old (actually or physically depending on how long it takes to resurrect him.)
* **Saint/messiah figures**: Baelor appears to be a universal figure of reverence for Sevenites and a worker of miracles.  If Jon brought back by Melisandre, then much like Beric he will function as an exemplar of R'hllorism simply by virtue of his resurrection. This is not necessarily a validation of R'hllorism. (see weirdo-ness below)
* **Miraculous underworld journeys**: Baelor's first miracle was a journey across the boneway to Sunspear. Jon's miraculous return from death (literally or as ""Ghost""), pulled by the fires of R'hllor, will be an inverse of Baelor's miraculous journey into death (the boneway) towards Sunspear.
* **Complex political conflict left by predecessor**: When he took the throne, Baelor had to defuse a potential war between the Six Kingdoms and Dorne, with factions in both camps favoring further conflict and the imminent execution of hostages. When he returns Jon will face an extraordinarily tense political situation with multiple factions--the pro-Jon Watch, the anti-Jon Watch, the Wildings, the Queen's men along with whatever Northern lords are present--at each others throats, along with a potential hostage crisis. If these factions fail to resolve their differences peacefully, the realms of men will be left defenseless when the Others come.

Now if Daeron is the inverse of Jon before his resurrection and Baelor after the resurrection, then what would be the remix of Baelor's actions in resolving the political situation be?

**4. Different kinds of weirdo, but weirdos nonetheless**.

First, let's look at the respective dispositions of Baelor and Jon. Baelor was a total weirdo; he was pious to the point of absurdity. This led him to eschew violence and forgive the Dornish (good), but it also led him to govern poorly, imprison his sisters to protect their chastity, never have sex with his wife and then (possibly) fast himself to death when his neglect of his wife's needs led her to give birth to a bastard (very bad). (For the Jon/Baelor comparison, isn't interesting that Baelor's death was prompted by the birth of a bastard?). 

I think many if not most fans expect Jon to also come back as a total weirdo. Particularly if he's spent any significant amount of time as a wolf. However, Jon's weirdness will be a mirror of Baelor's. While Baelor was divorced from worldliness and the body (he was celibate and fasted frequently, even to the point of starvation), Jon's time as a wolf will leave him grounded in the visceral and atavistic preferences of a wild animal, which cares nothing for restraint in service to abstractions like piety, but greatly values the pleasures of the flesh, particularly hunting and killing prey, then savoring its flesh and hot blood. 

In other words, Jon will be literally and figuratively bloodthirsty. (And possibly less puritanical when it comes to his own sexuality, though I'm not sure that will be relevant before Dany's arrival at the Wall). This wolfishness will drive Jon's behaviour just as Baelor's piety drove his own.

However, while as Baelor's piety and unworldliness caused him to succeed and then fail when it runs amuck, John's wolfishness will cause him to fail at first, but he will be able to restrain his madness and repair the damage he has done

**5. Rejecting vs embracing retributive justice (i.e. vengeance)**. 

The first challenge faced by Baelor was resolving the question of what to do with the Dornish hostages. The nobles desired vengeance and Baelor's Hand, Viserys, had imprisoned the hostages in anticipation of their execution. 

Although nothing is certain about the milieu in which Jon will find himself, the situation at the Wall provides great potential for a dual-hostage crisis. If I were to guess, I would say that the mutineers, or at least some of them, will have been captured by a pro-John faction, either the Wildlings or the pro-John Watch. However, some or all of the Wildling hostages taken as a precondition for passing through the wall (including Tormund's son) will be held by the anti-Jon Watch. 

**What Baelor did**: Baelor resolved conflict in his time by rejecting the vengeance advocated by his Hand of the King (Viserys) and pardoning the hostages.

**Jon's Remix:** Jon will reject the course advocated by his Right Hand Man (Tormund) and seek justice, though it will be the justice rooted in retribution for wrongs done to him (i.e., vengeance). Thus, instead of creating peace by forgiving the injustices done against him and forgoing vengeance, Jon will aggravate the conflict by seeking retribution. While Baelor laid the foundation for a full unification with Dorne later (through peaceful negotiation (i.e., the marriage he arranged), Jon's aggravation of the conflict will work to undo his own accomplishments in forging peace with the Wildlings.

One scenario I can imagine involves Tormund strongly advocating that Jon spare the conspirators to prevent the killing of the Wildling hostages. Jon might execute the conspirators, prompting the retaliatory killing of the Wildling hostages (again, possibly including Tormund's son). This would alienate Tormund, causing him to actively oppose Jon or simply be unwilling to actively support Jon. Either way Jon will be weakened without Tormund's help. Though, If I had to choose, I think the rule of drama means that Tormund's son will die and Tormund will actively oppose Jon.

Similarly, Jon when faced with opposing factions, Jon will be inclined to reject peacemaking, even when favored by his forces. In particular, members of the Watch might favor peaceful reunification with there erstwhile brothers. Jon however, may feel that he gave the mutineers more than adequate explanations already and to speak further will be pointless.

**6. Serpents Den**:

**What Baelor did**: Baelor entered the serpents den and rescued Aemon the Dragonknight without violence, though resulting in his own serious injury.

**Jon's Remix**: I'm not sure there will be a reflection of this in Jon's story, since I don't think GRRM is looking to repeat the Baelor story point by point. Rather I think he would try to have the themes echo across their stories. However, if I had to find a parallel, perhaps Jon would attempt to rescue someone held captive (Val and Monster?) by storming the tower and killing everyone in it. In the melee, the target of the rescue would be seriously hurt, or even killed. (For extra pathos, Monster dies and this creates a rift with Sam b/c of how it will affect Gilly). Alternatively, the serpents den could be a parley with the mutineers, a parley which Jon violates by attacking the leaders of the mutineer faction, resulting in the death or serious injury of someone Jon values greatly, perhaps even Ghost (his bodyguard in a white coat).

**7. How their arcs end: embracing or rejecting madness**.

**What Baelor did**: Baelor's reign ended when he doubled down on his insanity and it killed him because he either (1) fasted himself to death or (2) was killed by his Hand for the good of the realm.

**Jon's Remix**: Jon will see the error of his ways and attempt to control his wolfish inclinations and desire for fire and blood. Possibly with the help of new arrivals at the Wall (my guess is Arya, who will have had her own experience with moving beyond revenge-brain, or Bran, whose greenseer powers may be helpful, but Sansa, Sam or even Tyrion could also make sense). After he reins in his bloodthirstiness (by switching to Blood Light \[Ha Ha\]), he will then attempt to make amends and play his part in repairing the fragile alliance of humans at the wall (perhaps Sansa will be instrumental in leading this effort). Instead of being killed by his ""Hand"" (Tormund), he will make peace with him. 

However, George is not telling the kind of story in which Jon's bad acts will be forgotten after he decides to turn away from his darker path. The nature of the amends to be made will be significant. And once those amends have been made, things will not just go back to the way they were. After seeing the wildness in Jon, many will be wary and distant. Tormund will work with Jon, but if his son was killed their relationship will not be the warm camaraderie of Dance. If Monster was killed, both Val and Sam will be similarly distant. Perhaps Jon will be viewed in the same way the direwolves are viewed by non-Starks; a wild animal, respected but feared. This could, of course, set the stage for further rapproachment story arcs in ADOS, or it could work as a foundation for a storyline anout his continuing detachment from the world, culminating in a heroic sacrifice.

However, this will be bittersweet as we have been told. So while Baelor's legacy is to be a saint who failed the realm, Jon's legacy will be the survival of the human race and, possibly, peace between the Wildlings and the Seven Kingdoms (some of the time at least). 

**TL;DR Jon's rise and fall was a reverse Young Dragon and his TWOW post-resurrection arc will be a reverse Baelor the Blessed in which he starts as a murder-hobo and ends by learning restraint and forgiveness.**",asoiaf,"[Spoilers EXTENDED] Jon and the Young Dragon, a remix."

1363,"George said in this latest update that he is writing something **every day for several hours.** 

So I agree with the people who think George separated **""returning to Braavos in a later week""** to writing about Arya the week he updated his blog with ""Arya is calling"". This indicates he wrote new chapters of her back in Westeros which he was working on last week and he is going back to make sure that all of her Braavos chapters are polished and line up with the new chapters he wrote about her recently. It was already confirmed that a set of Arya Braavos chapters were completed as early as 2012. (Interesting note: A file of the first chapter in the set was titled ""Mercy""[.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eed51651df58762340314a53d334c8b5302228e/0_1248_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;s=86a83c97279b1c9c5ab3485c1488dc01) It was called ""Arya I"")


Must mean whatever Arya POV he was writing/editing last week includes new material set **after-Braavos.** He said he writes in batches/multiple chapters in the same POV... so getting several chapters of Arya back in Westeros looks likely.

George said Arya would flower or get her moonblood in TWOW. As Mercy, we see her point out she is still *""a year or two""* away from that flowering. So does that mean TWOW pace will pickup and cover a longer time-span? A lot can happen during that space of time in Winds. If he continues that pace in ADOS then Arya could end the series the same age as Lyanna was when she disappeared near Harrenhal.

1371,"So, like most of the readers of ASOIAF series I’ve been intrigued about a lot of stuff that’s happened in the books. One of the things that never fails to intrigue me is the famed birthplace of Jon Snow, the Tower of Joy. Now this thing here makes no sense to me for all the shitstorm that has happened here. Now if you asked me, “Do you believe that what D&amp;D gave us about the TOJ is accurate?” my only answer would be “Hell, no.” The reason for that is not because I don’t believe a single thing that comes out of the mouth of those two sons of sorry excuses(you know them), but overall it does not make any sense to me. To get a clear picture of what I’m trying to say lets look at where the Tower of Joy actually sits in Dorne.

The TOJ is situated right by the Prince’s Pass. For those who don’t know what the Prince’s Pass is, it is one of the pathways through which one could enter or exit Dorne. To put it simply it is the way through which one can move an army into Dorne or one can bring it outside of Dorne. The Prince’s Pass is always heavily fortified during times of wars. Even during Robert’s Rebellion this would’ve been the case as to shut any enemy invasion. The pathway would always be active during war crisis even when Dorne is not participating in the war as we see in the War of Five Kings. Now when people try to tell me that Rhaegar Targaryen hid with Lyanna Stark in this Tower by the Prince’s Pass for an entire war in which the Dornish took part in actively, it makes me feel as if I’m Jon ‘You know nothing’ Snow. But I’m not because I know that idea doesn’t make any sense.

Marching an army forth is not a single process. There will be scouts to make the surroundings are clear for an army to march forth without getting ambushed by enemy forces. If you asked me that tower was the worst place to hide if you didn’t want to get caught by the Dornish forces. Yeah, Rhaegar Targaryen, you dumbass, if you did not want to get caught cheating you wife by your brother-in-law you should’ve chosen a better place to hide you wiseass. The Prince’s Pass would’ve been filled with soldiers during the war. Moreover Doran sent ten thousand men outside of Dorne to the Trident. Now people trying to tell me that these ten thousand dornish spears moved through the Prince’s pass and did not scout this tower standing over there like Mary Poppins’ umbrella I don’t know who is the actual stupid here. Is it smart, beautiful Rhaegar Targaryen, or is it the Dornish army who knows not a thing about warfare or is it George R.R Martin himself who missed that thing here. 

Starting with the Dornish army, the warfare that Dornish people excels in is not field battle like the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. They excel in guerrilla warfare. Does it mean that they don’t know how to march or scout or do the other basic things like the other kingdoms do? No, absolutely not. The reason for that is, Dorne has fought in field battles before. They have invaded other kingdoms before. Granted they were defeated most of the time but scouting is one of the basic knowledge of warfare. You don’t have to be a master strategist or tactician like Alexander the Great to know how to use scouts. Any clown with a basic knowledge about warfare would know how to use scouts because it is very essential in both medieval and mordern warfare. So the chances of this huge dornish army passing through the Prince’s Pass without taking a look at the tower standing nearby which could potentially hide an enemy army waiting to ambush them is next to none. These guys could’ve passed through the Boneway you can say but both the pathways are heavily fortified during wars even when Dorne is not taking part in it as I already mentioned. To say that Doran Martell failed to guard the gateway to his realm is obviously saying that he is a stupid.

It could’ve been overlooked by George as it is just a historical aspect of the story, right? You can ask me and the answer is, Yes, it could’ve been overlooked. But given the fact that George takes complete care even when writing the past events (Ned’s arrival to Sisterton with a random fisherman’s daughter, the battles of Summerhall, the Battle of Bells) it is quite a stretch to think it as such. Every time George writes a battle plan in the story he never fails to include the scouts in it. The books make clear of it. In fact it was the scouts under the command of Brynden Tully who lured Jaime into a trap and won the Whispering Woods for Robb. So I don’t think that George would come out and say that the dornish kinda forgot about scouting.

That leaves us with, is it the product of Rhaegar Targaryen’s famous stupidity? As much as I like to prove that this guy is a moron again and again, I don’t think even Rhaegar is such a goner to do that. He wouldn’t have been sitting ducks for the dornish army to hunt him and mess up all his faultless plans. Even if he was a retard, the men with him were not. Arthur Dayne and Oswell Whent, I don’t think them to be such. I don’t have any proofs to prove that in Whent’s case but Arthur Dayne defeated the infamous Kingswood Brotherhood in a brilliant and strange manoeuver, while passing through the camp of the Golden Company, Jon Con thinks that it was well set that even Arthur Dayne would’ve approved of it, meaning he was no stupid. 

So does that mean that the dornish knew they were there and did nothing? Does that mean Elia showed the green light to the famous Targaryen polygamy? I can hear a couple of R+L fans with their applause, “I told you she was on board with the plan. Its bloody brilliant.” Well to them, Sorry, mates, but its absolute bonkers. Why is Elia a hostage in King’s Landing then? Rhaegar had ten thousand swords behind him. The moment Aerys told him about his wish to keep his family as hostages, he would’ve said “Damn you, dad. I’m not taking your crap anymore.” He would’ve sent both Elia and Lyanna to Sunspear where they both will be safe and Elia could take care of Lyanna. Unfortunately that was not the case. 

So what is the truth about the TOJ mystery? Honestly guys, I don’t know, I’ll admit. As far as I know, I believe that it makes little sense that R+L hid there, that is realistically speaking. But GOT and Ned’s dream in the books...? The show is pure dumpster even before Season 8 (they even had only two kingsguards in place of three) and Ned’s dream in the books is a fever dream. He even dreams of rose petals in the sky. It doesn’t mean that his dream is accurate. Like everyone else I’m waiting for TWOW to arrive so that we could get to know more about it. Until then you guys stay classy. ",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Tower of Joy and the dumbassery of Rhaegar Targaryen... or was it the Martells'?
1372,"“... the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat, and choke the life from you.”

Strangling is a particularly ugly, personal way of killing someone.

If Jaime is the valonqar:
-he somehow survives Stoneheart
-fights the Others
-possibly even befriends the Starks or joins the BWB
-eventually hears that his children have died

He feels intense grief and guilt, and is determined to reunite with Cersei. During his journey south, he even fantasizes about consoling and protecting her.

Then he finds her. She’s visibly pregnant and drunk off her ass. She sees him and flies into a rage. She accuses him of betrayal, calls him weak, and blames him for the deaths of Tommen and Myrcella. Her hatefulness and infidelity anger him, and he attacks her. Cersei fights back viciously. He strangles her while she stabs him with a shard of glass. He bleeds out, dying not too long after her.

If Tyrion is the valonqar:
-she’s not even the first woman he’s strangled to death
-Cersei (somewhat) sealed her own fate by having abused him first
-hopefully, she takes him down with her

1377,"Hey guys,   


This is a message to all this community. I owe you a big big one, and here is why :   


So growing up as a kid, I started to read Harry Potter and had the idea to become a writer. I wanted to be as badass as JRR Tolkien and build a huge fantasy world with swords and stuff. As the years went by, that faded away, though never completely. After rereading the stuff I had tried to write down, I realized that the imagination was there, but not the talent in writing beautifully constructed sentences, second degree writing, etc. Other passions also gained territory in my mind, such as music.   


I started being involved in different music bands since high school, and my interests in being involved in bands evolved until adulthood. I'm now in a band in which we play mainly prog psych rock, it's mostly in French as we live around Montreal. Cool association with cool bandmates, good spirits, freedom of creativity as our souls go. Our main songwriter is a biologist and writes a lot about science stuff, Tardigrades, brain-chemistry, the beneficial effects of the sun and nature contemplation on a wandering mind, etc. A couple of songs are also classic blues with love as a main theme. Some songs will go and tell the story about specific characters we will introduce, such as Éric Lambert, a space pirate who flees the authority, and Richard Landry, some iconical super-capitalist industrial.   


As a big fan of fantasy worlds such as Lord of the Rings, The Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem and ASOIAF, there was always some motivations to go back to writing, or to world building. I'm always excited to discover the secrets of the scenario, the tiny details that frame a story. At night, when I have trouble sleeping, I often go, since I discovered the R+L=J theory, on this specific reddit community and love to explore all through the ideas, the theories, the genuine good ones and the most farfetched, tinfoilish and crackpot ones just to know what crossed the mind of the writer, and to also see how redditers will react. The first time I stepped on some Euron = Benjen = Daario theories, I couldn't stop laughing at how funny it was to see people counter argue and completely dismiss the possibility. I also was picturing this Euron running super fast between the Iron Islands castles and go back to his ship and run to Daenerys and other stuff around these guys and couldn't stop laughing at how funny it was to build a different universe in reading through somebody's stuff with a different idea, and messing with the codes and the logic of the world building. I myself thought Rhaegar was Jaqen at some point and started to dismiss this whole thing while looking for hints in this reddit and laughed it off quickly.  


At some point, I have a flash. I run through the songs of my band in my head and I start picturing those Euron, Benjen, Daario, Rhaegar, Jaqen. And then I send a joke to the guys in my band and say ""Oh my god guys I have an outstanding theory, you won't believe it, Éric Lambert = Richard Landry"". And just for the joke, I started saying that as a space pirate, Éric Lambert couldn't stop fleeing from the space authorities and had to hide by transforming his identity. But then, still just to make my bandmates laugh, I started to integrate all the original songs of the band repertory and farfetchedly built a huge story about how a guy on earth became cynical of love and politics on earth, died in a volcano and saw his DNA being shipped off in space by some tardigrade of earth, got cloned and all this brain-chemistry made all its way back, and he became a space-pirate only to become a capitalist emperor of the galaxies.   


Guys laughed. And said ""well that's pretty f\*cking dope, let's actually do this"". And I was like ""well it was just to mess with you this is pure bullsh\*t"". They said ""no no no man, we do this stuff"".  


So basically, the singer of my band is a pure author, he can write smooth sentences, frame a scenario with different storytelling, and has a creativity of framing an object that goes beyond my mind. I wrote him a scenario based on my tinfoil stuff and he ended up writing the whole story. The book is achieved, printed and the word goes on. Earlier today, we launched the book in pre-order.  


All this to say a huge, huge, huge, huge thank you. As a community, your conversations here gave me the fuel to revive a childhood dream that was to build a crazy-ass world. Now instead of swords, it is space-craft, and it is mainly driven by the songs material from our songwriter, but then all those pieces fitting together was really, and I mean it, really, triggered by all the idea floating around here, the theories, the counter arguments... And it was really important to me to say a huge thank you for this. I released the most messed up material I ever was involved around in my life today, and it all started here.   


**TL;DR : My band and I launched a novel today around our songs. I came up with the scenario and the fuel of the ideas came from this community, speaking about theories, secret identities and hidden ideas. And I thought it was important to say a meaningful thank you, I am very grateful for the activity going on here, and please don't stop, you guys are absolutely inspiring.**",asoiaf,"[Spoilers extended] To all this community, a HUGE thank you."

1385,"First post here!! So I believe this subreddit as a collective have correctly worked out a deal of the meanings of Daenerys's visions in The House Of The Undying. In this thread, I would like to call attention to one particular vision and what I think it means for the future of Queensguard Barristan Selmy.

# The Vision

Daenerys is shown a number of visions, pasts that were, futures that will be, and futures that never will. The vision I wish to call attention to is: 
&gt;**""Behind a silver horse, the bloody corpse of a naked man bounced and dragged.""** 

At first instinct, this is merely a callback to the fate of the wine merchant assassin who attempted to poison Dany and was made to walk naked behind her horse until his death.

However, I believe this is a literary misdirection by GRRM, making a part of the vision strongly resemble a prior event to make us *think* we have it figured out. I do not believe a half-assed assassin is weighty or important enough to warrant a vision from The Undying. I believe the naked corpse is actually Barristan Selmy after dying in the Battle Of Slaver's Bay.

# Foreshadowing

A master of foreshadowing in many different ways, GRRM has also potentially provided foreshadowing for this event to pass. In AGOT, upon being dismissed from the Kingsguard, Barristan Selmy removes his white cloak and armor, and boldly asserts that he will die a knight.

&gt; **""A naked knight, it would seem,""**
 
is Littlefinger's reply, to the great amusement of everyone at court.

The Essosi in general (and the cities of Slaver's Bay in particular) seem to abhor the use of armor or at least see it as shameful to a degree. There are countless examples of this throughout the series, from the Dothraki shouting insults at Jorah Mormont for donning armor before combat in AGOT, to Barristan's fight with Khrazz; one of the best fights in the series, where Khrazz repeatedly berates Barristan for his use of armor, even going so far as to shout mid-combat:

&gt; **""Take off that armor!""**

Another factor (thanks to u/markg171) from a spoiler chapter from TWOW, is that Barristan has chosen to ride Dany's silver into battle to inspire the Meereenese in the fight. Daenerys silver is explicitly NOT trained for combat or war, as evidenced when she was forcibly pulled from her saddle by Mero, the Titan's Bastard in his attempt to assassinate her. 

&gt; **""The ground came up and knocked the breath from her, as her silver whinnied and backed away.** 

That was her silver's response to a relatively tame combat scenario. It didn't rear or try to bite Mero or protect Daenerys at all. Ironically, Barristan comes to her rescue immediately after this. Yet he still opts to use this untrained horse in war.

He is additionally impaired by the use of his helm in this TWOW reading, which he explicitly mentions in the *Kingbreaker* chapter to be less than effective.

&gt; The helm he left upon its hook. **The narrow eye slit limited his vision,** and he needed to be able to see for what was to come. The halls of the pyramid were dark at night, and foes could come at you from either side. Besides, though the ornate dragon's wings that adorned the helm were splendid to look upon, **they could too easily catch a sword or axe.**

And if you're one of those who believe that Skahaz mo Kandaq poisoned the locusts as detailed in The Meereenese Blot, and that he is not as friendly to Daenerys' regime as he portrays himself, then his continual and repeated urging of an attack which he knows would be led by Barristan seems suspicious. He is in a prime place to close the gates behind Barristan's vanguard, putting them in a crippling position if they need to retreat.

# Daenerys's Dark Turn

If you are one of the many like me, who believe that the endgame contains a darker Daenerys embracing ""Fire And Blood"" as hinted at in her hallucinations of Viserys and Jorah in the Dothraki Sea, then you will be searching for catalysts to spur her further along this path.

Barristan is currently the only trusted advisor she has who is Westerosi like her, his loyalty has never wavered since he swore her his sword, and Daenerys has always thought highly of and respected him. In fact, here is one of her first thoughts upon meeting him, while he was still under the guise of Arstan Whitebeard:

&gt;  ""She studied Arstan's face. **He had a great dignity** to him, a quiet strength she liked.""

There is no better way to ignite a Fire and Blood campaign across Essos, than Daenerys returning from the Dothraki Sea to find the terrible aftermath of the battle, to find the bloody, naked corpse of a knight who loved and served her being dragged behind her silver. It is the perfect catalyst to set up ruthless retaliation by Daenerys. An undignified end for a man of great dignity.

It's so sadistic and that's why I'm absolutely sure this is GRRM's intent, haha. Feel free to discuss, theorize, pick it apart. I love this sub and am excited to hear people's thoughts.",asoiaf,A Naked Knight. (Spoilers Extended)

1390,"In AFFC, we are told tales of a man wearing the Hound's helm pillaging across the Riverlands and committing atrocious crimes;

""There is a knight at Saltpans,"" Ser Arwood insisted. ""He hid behind his walls whilst Clegane and his mad dogs ravaged through his town. You have not seen the things he did, ser. I have. When the reports reached the Twins, I rode down with Harys Haigh and his brother Donnel and half a hundred men, archers and men-at-arms. We thought it was Lord Beric's work, and hoped to find his trail. All that remains of Saltpans is the castle, and old Ser Quincy so frightened he would not open his gates, but shouted down at us from his battlements. The rest is bones and ashes. A whole town. **The Hound put the buildings to the torch and the people to the sword and rode off laughing. The women . . . you would not believe what he did to some of the women. I will not speak of it at table. It made me sick to see.""**

In response to this, Lyle Crakehall 'The Strongboar' promises to hunt down the Hound after Riverrun has fallen.

&gt;""He was seen,"" Ser Arwood said. ""That helm of his is not easily mistaken, nor forgotten, and there were a few who survived to tell the tale. The girl he raped, some boys who hid, a woman we found trapped beneath a blackened beam, the fisherfolk who watched the butchery from their boats . . .""
""Do not call it butchery,"" Lady Mariya said softly. ""That gives insult to honest butchers everywhere. Saltpans was the work of some fell beast in human skin.""
This is a time for beasts, Jaime reflected, for lions and wolves and angry dogs, for ravens and carrion crows.
""Evil work."" Strongboar filled his cup again. ""Lady Mariya, Lady Amerei, your distress has moved me. You have my word, **once Riverrun has fallen I shall return to hunt down the Hound and kill him for you. Dogs do not frighten me.""**
This one should. Both men were large and powerful, but Sandor Clegane was much quicker, and fought with a savagery that Lyle Crakehall could not hope to match.

Now, we know that this man wearing the Hound's helm isn't actually Sandor Clegane, who's presumed dead and may or may not be serving penance as a grave digger on the Quiet Isle, but nevertheless the Strongboar is still intent on hunting the Hound down.

Among the characters that appear in the books, Monterys Velaryon is the most junior descendant of the Conqueror and thus the last in this line. It is worth mentioning that Elaena Targaryen had three Penrose daughters and Rhaena Targaryen, younger sister of Baela, had six Hightower daughters. It is inconceivable that none of those nine women have legitimate descendants in 300 AC.

The Young Griff is not included because his existence and true identity are unknown. If he truly is Aegon Targaryen, he is the rightful king and Daenerys is the first in line; if he is a legitimate Blackfyre, he comes between the Tarths and the Martells; and if he is an unrelated impostor or of illegitimate descent, he does not figure in the line of succession at all.

**Notes:**

^(a) The succession to the Iron Throne was originally held to be governed by the same principles as lordships, with daughters succeeding in the absence of sons. The great councils of 101 and 233, however, established the principle that the Iron Throne could not pass to a female dynast or a female dynast's descendant for as long as there were male dynasts. This no longer applies after the extinction of House Targaryen in the male line with the death of Viserys Targaryen.

^(b) House Tarth is known to have ""ties ... recently to House Targaryen"". Here I accept as valid the conclusions of many fellow Redditors that ""ties"" means descent and specifically descent from one of the two daughters of Maekar I Targaryen, Daella or Rhae Targaryen, both of whom are explicitly said (by Aemon Targaryen) to have had issue. Excluding Rhaelle, Daella and Rhae are the most recent Targaryen princesses to marry outside House Targaryen. Descent from one of them would thus qualify as recent ties to House Targaryen.

^(c) Manfrey Martell is introduced in *A Feast for Crows* as a cousin of Doran Martell. Here I assume that ""cousin"", without any qualifications, means first cousin, the child of one's aunt or uncle. The assumption is based on the common meaning of the unqualified word in both the books and real life. If he is a first cousin of Doran Martell, Manfrey Martell is also a grandson of the first Daenerys Targaryen.

^(d) Bellegere Otherys's inclusion in the line of succession is contingent upon the legitimacy of herself and her mother. It can be argued that one or all the women in the line are likely illegitimate, being daughters of courtesans, but their legitimacy is never discussed. All the women passed the name of their noble family to their daughters, which may point to legitimacy.

**Observations**

* The line of succession is astonishingly short considering that the Iron Throne has existed for 300 years and passed through 13 generations of kings. This is partly explained by the incestuous unions of the Targaryens, as two children would have a single line of descent instead of two. The line shows that in all this time, only five Targaryen princesses married out of their house and had descendants surviving up to 300 AC. There is also the well-known problem of ancient houses being inconceivably small, however, suggesting that the characters in the books probably have unmentioned relatives.
* Seven people who are in the line in *A Game of Thrones* are dead by the end of *A Dance with Dragons*: Robert Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Quentyn Martell, Oberyn Martell, Cortnay Penrose, and Monford Velaryon.
* The first adult in the line is Stannis; of all the characters in the line, he is also the closest one biologically related to Daenerys. If Tommen and Myrcella are exposed as bastards, he becomes first in line and everyone else moves two places up.
* Arianne precedes Trystane in the Dornish line of succession but he precedes her in the line to the Iron Throne.
* No character in the line keeps the Old Gods. Bellegere Otherys, fourth generation Braavosi, and Ben Plumm, half-Dothraki and only about 1/8 Westerosi, are the characters who almost certainly do not follow either of the major religions of the Seven Kingdoms.
* Bellegere Otherys is the only descendant of Aegon IV's legitimized bastards included in this line. She and Brynden Rivers, who removed himself from the line by taking the black and then disappeared beyond the Wall, are the only descendants of Aegon IV's bastards whom the reader knows to be alive in 300 AC.
* While no-one in this line except the Baratheons claims any right to the Iron Throne, the Martells and the Plumms are very much aware of their Targaryen heritage. Quentyn Martell dies in an attempt to claim his place among the dragonlords. Daenerys notes that her dragon Viserion likes Brown Ben Plumm, who then surprises her by explaining to her his descent from the Targaryens. Quentyn and Ben are the closest relatives, except her brother Viserys, whom Daenerys meets as of *A Dance with Dragons*.
* The line of succession features Stormlanders, Dornishmen, a Braavosi of noticeable Summer Islander heritage, Westermen, a half-Dothraki mongrel, and a Valyrian, but no Northmen, Valemen, Rivermen, or Reachmen.
* The only ethnic Valyrian in the line of succession to Daenerys, herself an ethnic Valyrian, is the boy who is last in the line: Monterys Velaryon. This is noteworthy because the Seven Kingdoms were united by Valyrians and the Iron Throne passed from one Valyrian to another for 13 generations. Incidentally, if female dynasts had not been historically excluded from the succession, Monterys Velaryon would be the heir to the Iron Throne as the senior descendant of Rhaenys Targaryen.",asoiaf,(Spoilers ADWD) A Delineation of the Succession to Daenerys I Targaryen According to the Law and Custom of the Realm and Some Observations Upon the Matter

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/hkrv2l)",asoiaf,Will Azor Ahai be real or a hoax?
1400,"Spoilers ahead —

I was rewatching S1 of the show and made it to E9. One part of it still puzzles me:

The big twist is, of course, Ned’s death but I’ve long felt curious about the fact that he of all people confesses to false charges of treason.  

To the best of my recollection, this doesn’t change the game much. He’s murdered anyway, tons of people are gossiping about Joffrey/Cersei/Jaime and I can’t recall a single soul saying, “Oh he *was* committing treason? Dang guess I’ll abandon my northern loyalties.”

But I doubt GRRM would put it in there for no reason. My best guess is it ties in somehow to the “love is the death of duty” tension, but I’m still not sure what to make of it. 

So what impact does Ned “confessing” have on the show and books, and how is it different from what would’ve happened if he’d stuck to his guns?",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] What significance does it have in the books and the show that ___________ confesses?
1401,"As anyone who reads ASOIAF knows, GRRM really likes his parallels between characters. This is also true for the main characters. I'm counting Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Arya, Bran, and Sansa as main characters. (I'm including Sansa because based on the show she is a main ending character.)

Here are a few of the parallels and contrasts that I think GRRM sets up between the main characters.  What do you think? What is the point of these parallels? Do you disagree with them? Are any mising?

**Jon and Dany** 

Both Targaryens, one knowing and one unknowing.

Both have brothers that die.

Both are mentored by a Mormont.

Both thrown into foreign cultures and have to adjust accordingly including being forced into their first sexual relationship.

Both struggle to create new situations that will allow a place for people that were despised, Dany with the slaves in Meereen and Jon with the Wildings.

Both have servants where a same-sex relationship is teased or actually happens (Satin and Irri).

Both are offered the opportunity to marry someone from another culture to make peace (Hizdahr and Val).

**Jon and Tyrion**

Both see themselves as ""bastards."" 

Both feel left out of their families. Jon is not trueborn like his brother and sisters. Tyrion has Jamie and Cersei, who have their own relationship, as his siblings.

Both can feel sorry for themselves. 

Both are required to lead the defense in a crucial battle.

**Tyrion and Bran**

Neither can fulfill the traditional expectations of being a warrior.

Both are younger siblings.

**Dany and Bran**

Both make journeys through desolate areas where there is little to eat (Bran to the weirwood trees and Dany through the desert to Quarth).

Both are accompanied by people who swear to them, for Bran the Reeds, for Dany her bloodriders and Ser Jorah.

Both eat an unpleasant substance that becomes pleasant upon further tasting that lets them see (Bran's weirwood paste and the substance Dany drinks in the House of the Undying). The descriptions of how the tastes change are remarkably similar with both drinks calling up memories.

Bran eats the paste to web the weirwood while Dany sees it as a wedding when she is in Drogo's funeral pyre.

**Arya and Bran**

A recent post I read suggested several things.

Both make a descent underground, Bran to the weirwood cave and Arya to the underground of the House of the Undying. Note the House of the Undying uses both weirwood and ebony wood.

Both are surrounded by the dead or dying.

The candles in the House of the Undying call up memories to Arya similar to the memories the weirwood paste calls up for Bran.

Both warg into multiple creatures. 

**Sansa and Bran**

Both have a ton of bird imagery and are mentored by birds (three-eyed crow and the Mockingbird).

Both as children like the romanticized ideals of the South. Bran wants to be a knight and loves knightly stories. Sansa likes stories of courtesy and heros and their ladies.

**Sansa and Dany**

Both as young girls are thrust into marriages/betrothals to those who are or will be kings and who hurt them.

Both at one point want their older brothers to help them.

Both are married very young. (Sansa is a bit different as she was married to Tyrion.)

Both deal with the deaths of the king who hurt them. Obviously, Dany changes her views about Drogo.

Both deal with ""knights"" who protect them but are interested in them sexually (Jorah and Sandor also Dontos is a sort of foil as a fool knight).

**Dany and Arya**

Both are interested in punishing wrongdoers, especially those who hurt their families.

Both along with Bran deal with odd magical groups that gain power from the dead or the dying. 

Both have man-killing beasts. Nymeria and her pack are taking down humans in the Riverlands. The dragons have also killed people. Ghost may have killed people too, but I don't remember.

Both deal with the after effects of war, especially if Arya comes back soon to Bravos from the Riverlands.

1403,"He's supposedly a great fighter but has no appetite for glory. He's described as a snack, essentially Loras with muscles and a beard yet he's happily married to a low-key Fossoway girl. He's one of the most powerful men in the realm after he was named lord of Brightwater Keep, yet he's humble and nice enough to comfort Sansa and Tyrion during their moment of public humiliation. 

It seems the guy is too perfect, almost suspiciously so. He's practically the classic ideal of a knight: brave, handsome, a defender of the weak...and thoroughly at odds with GRRM's deconstruction of traditional tropes.

1422," 

The question everyone was wondering after the end of the show was almost the same; Will Dany go mad the same way? Will she be cruel? Will it be similar? Or was it one of Dan and David's nonsense?

I also read her POVs from scratch to achieve this answer; I came to the same conclusion by examining the development of her story and character. She is going to enter a darker path.

So, according to Isaac (Bran) and D&amp;D's statement, Bran would also be a “king,” although I have serious doubts and inquiries that this “king” figure will be in 7K shape, we don't expect another of Bran to sit on the Iron Board at the end of the series. This reason we have to think that the “death” of Dany will happen as well, because the only purpose of Dany's life is to sit on the throne and take over 7K.

So far all kings / queens acting for this purpose have died, will die (Stannis, Euron, Cersei, Marg, etc.). Therefore, it does not seem possible in terms of story mathematics to expect Dany to return to Essos when she loses her throne and lives quietly somewhere. So we have to accept her death.

*What I want to discuss here is how will Daenerys die? Will she be stabbed by Jon or die from someone else's hand? By fighting or the scene in the series takes place exactly? Is there any sign in the books?*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Blue Flower on the wall and Sweet Smell**

&gt;Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. **A** **blue** **flower** **grew** **from** **a** **chink** **in** **a** **wall** **of** **ice**, **and** **filled** **the** **air** **with** **sweetness**… . mother of dragons, **bride of fire** … - Daenerys, ACoK

The biggest and strongest evidence of Daenerys' death is actually this sentence.

Dany is warned by the Undying Ones. They told her that some events would happen and that it would be her disaster. Dany didn't understand the jigsaw words. So Dany asked them to explain and show her and they did.

This vision is an image shown to explain those disasters. To show Dany things and people that will hurt in the future ... The blue flower on the ice is Jon Snow. This flower emits sweet scent into the air. This is not a ""love"" sign, but a ""death"" sign. In books, the word ""sweet"" appears to be a sign of death in weight (or to face death). In addition, the word sweet and death are used side by side. So we need to pay attention to the places where this word is used.

For example, Sweet Raff, nicknamed ""sweet"", shows that GRRM sentenced this person to death. He died in his Mercy POV. Dany remembers Sir Willem smelling ""sweet"" when he was on his deathbed. (Sickness)+dead=sweet We see that later. Bran's fall. Before fall he felt sweet pain in his body and also he used ""sweet peach"" word and he almost died, he was in coma. Who gave poison to Jon Arryn? ""A sweet old friend.""(Lysa and LF). Varys calls Lancel as ""sweet boy"" And Tyrion too in second book. He almost died in Battle of Blackwater and he may die in the future. Dany's wine was described as ""sweet"" The wine was poisonous. Drogo's wound smeel ""sweet"" He died. Jorah even gave Dany a sweet peach. Just like the Renly and Stannis scene (both brothers are dead, will die) (These are just a few examples, more dozens. [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cr8me0/a\_death\_mark\_in\_asoiaf\_sweet\_spoiler\_main/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cr8me0/a_death_mark_in_asoiaf_sweet_spoiler_main/) )

Whether there is a love between Jon and Dany, the result will not change; this sentence points to Dany's death and Jon's (direct or indirect) connection with it (in fact, it would be a mistake to add Jon alone here, the prophecy describes the complete disaster of Dany, so everyone and everything that is part of that prophecy will be a part of it, like a kind of paving stone).

*Of course, ""love"" is sometimes sweet, but it is also a deadly poison. We saw the expression of this several times in the series; From Cersei to Sansa and Selmy to Daenerys…*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Love is a poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same."" - Cersei, ACoK  
Her love for Daario is poison. A slower poison than the locusts, but in the end as deadly."" - Selmy, ADwD

If we were only talking about love, GRRM could describe it with many different words such as “nice” smell, “pretty” smell or “smell that will warm the heart” instead of sweet, but he chose the word “sweet”.

**So the blue flower (Jon) that emits sweet smell = will cause the death (direct or indirect) of the person (Dany) who smells it.**

If we understood the sweet smell and blue flower, now let's move on to other (possible) signs.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Wolves and Crows**

&gt;“My flesh will feed the wolves and carrion crows, she thought sadly, and worms will burrow through my womb.” —Daenerys, ADWD

It is not very interesting when it is first read, but it is a remarkable sentence afterwards. ""Wolves"" and ""crows"" will eat her flesh…

There is a character in the series that is both ""wolf"" and ""crow"".

Other than that, if we call Jon only as ""wolf"", another character called ""crow"" is ""Euron Greyjoy"".

It should not be forgotten that Daario is the commander of the Storm Crows (remember the word Selmy said).

So three (or two; if the daario-euron is the same) are people who are related to the character ""crow + wolf"" and will be associated with the death / fall of Dany (along with prophecies, etc.).

Let's not forget the prophecy of Moqorro that Euron is chasing Dany (of course it is obvious that he does not intend to kill, but I think he will be on her side and have a bad effect on her. [https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gdjb4t/spoiler\_published\_euron\_greyjoy\_ice\_or\_fire/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gdjb4t/spoiler_published_euron_greyjoy_ice_or_fire/) )

&amp;#x200B;

* **Sweet Peach Metaphor**

The sweet peach issue is directly related to the ""sweet"" issue. I think we first heard that word when Robert said to Ned, and then Bran used that phrase before he fell. Then there is the scene where Jorah offers a sweet peach to Dany and Dany eats it, and Renly has the scene of offering it to Stannis and eating it in himself. Finally, Asha has a memory that she talks about it and remembers eating.

To sum up, sweet peaches are also a concept with a death relationship. Of course there are things such as sweet wine, locusts fries (poisonous) or milk (sweet sleeping poison), but the interesting part here is that the “sweet” and “peach” and is always presented as an inseparable duo, and in every book there is a definite repetition at least once (this is a special metaphor like a bloody orange metaphor).

If you didn't read this ([Sweet Peach and Women](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dbbk0z/sweet_peach_and_women_spoiler_published/) ) thread, you should. For those who read, continue… As you know, the concept of “peach” expresses the woman as a metaphor and as mentioned in the thread, many characters related to sweet peach died because of a woman; directly or indirectly.

I think of the possibility that Arya Stark, referred to as ""sweet peach"" in the series, may be the main person to pull the sword. I have two bases and a + theory for this.

My first stop is a word used by GRRM.

&gt;GRRM’s favorite line in the books is often repeated (denoting its importance later on) a line Jon tells Arya when they last meet, “Stick 'em with the pointy end.” &lt;&lt; This line comes up several times in both Jon &amp; Arya’s POVs.

As you know, there are repetitive sentences in the series; You know nothing Jon Snow; If I turn around, I will be lost… like. These sentences mean something important in the life of those characters, there are references like an FS.

GRRM's favorite line is ""Stick'em with the pointy end""... well, its important line for him.

The question is; Against whom should Arya use this sword? In the first book, if we do not count the child in the city of KL, Arya did not technically use this sword against someone.

If we don't count Cersei, the people on Arya's list are not very important. Of course, I keep the dead (like Tywin) out of it. Cersei will be killed by someone else, then who? Technically it doesn't work on Others. Then this must be a human.

According my ""[The Campions](https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/cvceq7/spoilers_extended_a_song_of_ice_and_fire/)"" theory, these two characters will be enemies to each other. Considering Jon's share in Dany's death, it makes sense to make things like Arya being the sword. Remember, this sentence is Arya's first sword lesson and Jon teaches her that. We read this sentence not only in Arya's but also in the chapters of Jon. These are very important and notable details.

This brings us to the third base. This will be a little out of the series. There is another fantastic series that makes a great contribution to the writing of the series; ""Memory, Sorrow and Thorn""

&gt;Definitely. I was a huge fan of Tad's MEMORY, SORROW, AND THORN -- in fact, I doubt I would ever have written my own series without the inspiration his provided. There are a number of other ""nods"" to my favorite fantasy authors buried in the books as well. - SSM, 1999 February

There is a video of GreyArea [""AA is A False Messenger""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MzyP-i-BHg&amp;feature=emb_logo)

She talks about this book series. There are 31 similarities between “A Song of Ice and Fire” and “Memory, Sorrow and Thorn” Here, you can read [https://ostenard.com/2014/06/16/25-similarities-between-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-and-memory-sorrow-and-thorn/](https://ostenard.com/2014/06/16/25-similarities-between-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-and-memory-sorrow-and-thorn/)

Many characters and items such as Arya and Jon are inspired by these books.

Arya's character is also hidden in the male disguise in this book and meets Jon's character, and these two fall in love. (Another inspiration for Jonrya is these books)

SPOILER FROM THIS BOOK

He is now a bad person, and years later his soul enters the body of another person and returns to the world.

1430,"My theory is simple, Targaryens suffer from reverse incest. Where breeding out of the bloodline leads to deformities. I.E. The Targaryens have magic in their blood, so they would probably want keep the blood pure so as to prevent magical issues. Imagine it like this, introducing new blood is like transfusing a different blood type and the magic acts like an anti-body. 

Edit 1: I would also point out that I am only considering super-magic families that are Valyrian, so only the Forty Freeholders. No Celtigars or Velaryon because they have no *true* Dragonblood.

Proof of concept:

1. Maegor Targaryen &amp; Alys Harroway: The child Maegor spawned with Alys was said to be a deformed eyeless creature with wings and scales. Alys was Non-Valyrian.
2. Viserys I Targaryen &amp; Alicent Hightower: Aemond Targaryen has long been shown to be a criminally insane dragon rider with a lack of moral compass and only singular loyalty to his brother. Alicent was Non-Valyrian.
3. Aegon II Targaryen &amp; Helaena Targaryen: Jaehaerys Targaryen had polydactyly with 12 toes and 11 fingers, this could be caused by parents sharing a Non-Valyrian grandmother.
4. Daeron II Targaryen &amp; Myriah Martell: Rhaegel Targaryen was long said to be completely mad. He was once said to have danced around the Red Keep naked. Myriah was Non-Valyrian.
5. Maekar I Targaryen &amp; Dyannah Dayne: Aerion Targaryen was a cruel madman who died drinking wildfire believing it would turn him into a dragon. Dyannah was Non-Valyrian.
6. Jaehaerys II Targaryen &amp; Shaena Targaryen: Aerys II Targaryen had the worst case of madness to date, willing to genocide half a million people in order to turn into a dragon and a strange combination of necro- and pyrophilia which caused him to rape his wife after burning people alive. This could be caused by extreme torture alongside parents sharing a Non-Valyrian grandmother.
7. The Entirety of Valyria: It's said that Valyrians constantly practiced incest. If this did cause madness and deformities their Freehold would've collapsed in a few years, yet it lasted nearly 8000 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Counter-Arguments:

1. Maegor Targaryen: While Maegor was pure Targaryen he was still mad. However I would argue this was due to his necromantic resurrection at the hands of Tyanna of the Tower as he was a stern, but arguably normal (For Medievals) king.
2. Baelor Targaryen: While Baelor was pure Targaryen he was still mad. However I would argue this was due to religious fanaticism and not pure madness, he believed in the Gods and had some highly unbreakable faith which wasn't removed because he was never raised to be King, once again normal by Medieval standards.
3. Jon Snow (If R+L=J): Jon Snow is not pure Targaryen and isn't mad or deformed. However I would remind you that all the aforementioned proofs all had siblings who turned out perfectly fine. Thus could be a similar case in Jon's situation, he wasn't an anti-incest bad apple.

&amp;#x200B;

In the normal world, incest doesn't make all offspring deformed or mad. Similarily Targaryen anti-incest doesn't make everyone deformed or mad (Edit 1: Including Targ Bastards like Bittersteel and Bloodraven), but it still weakens the gene pool with every generation.

How much blood do the current baratheons actually share with Durran godsgrief after 8000 years, maybe a drop? Even if we assume that only males tranfer the seed genes or something, the continent shouldve been overrun with baratheon lookalikes. 

 Is it even a Baratheon or a Durrandon feature? what does it mean for Argella Durrandon who married Orys Baratheon, Orys has black eyes not blue so its not from him. Ned didn’t even look deep into 8000 years of genealogy or whatever record was left behind at the citadel before deciding Joffrey is a bastard. With hundreds of houses, I dont think a single book no matter how thick contains all the features of all the great houses.

 I think both Jon and Ned were just disturbed by Joffrey and it subconsciously affected their judgement (I dont think they would even investigate if Joffrey didnt exist and Tommen is heir) I don’t think Jon Arryn was certain in his suspicions yet when he died, Ned assumed it was true because he trusts his father figure and Littlefinger was nudging him to that direction.

1438,"I posted most of this in a comment over on r/pureasoiaf but I thought it was an interesting topic that warranted a post. 

In this post I’ll discuss Bloodraven’s potential payoff for being such a powerful figure in AsoIaF. 


Bloodraven in the past was notable for employing a huge spy network and using it (and other abilities) to shut down the Blackfyre rebellions while he was hand of the king. This was ultimately to solidify the Targaryen dynasty. He removed threats however he could no matter how dishonorable. This caused him to be exiled, but he clearly didn’t regret it. He was widely disliked by Blackfyre supporters and more people since he essentially tried to make a surveillance state.

Most of this is establish his main motivation: preservation of the Targaryens, no matter the cost. So far we see him as an opposing force to the Others, but I don’t see why he wouldn’t use his new power to try to help his family too since that was what he was did the rest of his life. Essentially there would be no point in adding Bloodraven specifically as the last greenseer if his past doesn’t factor in. 

We know Bloodraven can’t change the past. Bran however might be able to, it’s all but confirmed by external sources (hodor moment in the show). But how does this the into his goal of Targaryen preservation? Maybe when he learns this, Bloodraven will encourage Bran to try to change his family’s past so they never lose the throne to begin with. This leads into the popular “omniscient bran” theory, maybe he tells Aerys to “burn them all” in reference to the Others, but this drives him mad and fixates him on fire, similar to Hodor situation. This is all just conjecture though.

As of right now, he is allied with the children of the forest against the Others. As a brother and former lord commander of the nights watch, the Others would be his enemies. It’s possible his Nights Watch vows have become more important to him than his past, and that bloodraven wont have any involvement with today’s Targaryens. 

Additionally the Golden Company founded by his rival Bittersteel is back in Westeros. Maybe his hatred of Blackfyres and Bittersteel will play into Aegons story?

Either way I can’t help but feel like choosing to make the last greenseer and a powerful skin changer also be a famous Targaryen is significant. I think in the end Bloodraven’s story while supplementary to Bran’s journey, will tie him and Bran back into the Targaryen Restoration in some way though Aegon or Dany, maybe even Jon. Otherwise there’s no real purpose to make him a Targaryen with such a fleshed our past instead of just a random wildling or something.

Yet, apparently that’s too complicated for the smallfolk, so they just end up worshipping the one deity as seven different gods.

This has always bugged me. The parallel to the Catholic Holy Trinity is obvious, GRRM has mentioned it was the inspiration. But, Catholics don’t exactly crumble into worshipping a polytheistic triad.

Theory: The world of *A Song of Ice and Fire* has a little *American Gods* in it. Worship can feed deities and possibly magic. Thousands of years ago, the Andals were given a faith which leads them to worship six almost suspiciously relatable divine beings all so worship will also flow to the Stranger who is really just one aspect of the God of Many Faces.

1448,"Unlike Melisandre and Moqorro who are almost unnmoving in their belief and support of R'hllor (don't @ me, I know we get some doubts in Mel's chapter). Thoros is described as not very ""priestly"":

&gt;She screwed up her face, trying to remember if her father had ever talked about Thoros. **""He isn't very priestly, is he?""** -ASOS, Arya IV

Whle the other two have a [goal/agenda](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gtzzi6/the_three_red_priests_and_azor_ahaispoilers/) it seems, Thoros begins by only caring about drinking, etc:

&gt; ""Master Mott said **Thoros could outdrink even King Robert. They were pease in a pod, he told me, both gluttons and sots.**"" -ASOS, Arya IV

With this in mind, I was thinking how crazy it must have been for Thoros to realize that his ""god"" (to him, to the reader, I would probably consider it more ""source of magic"") is in fact real.

**As compared to The Damphair, who in *The Forsaken*faces the fact that his god has basically ""abandoned him"", Thoros realizes that he was wrong all these years and there is a purpose to his life.**

***

While he was a drunk and sot, Thoros most definitely did not lack for courage.

**First over the walls at Pyke**

&gt;He liked feasts and tourneys, that was why King Robert was so fond of him. And this Thoros was brave. **When the walls of Pyke crashed down, he was the first through the breach. He fought with one of his flaming swords, setting ironmen afire with every slash.**"" -ASOS, Arya IV

and:

&gt;The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red robes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword in hand. -AGOT, Sansa II

Even Ned remembers (assuming why he calls Thoros fearless):

&gt;The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword. **He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened the mounts of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros**. -AGOT, Eddard VII

And there is a reason Ned made the choice to send him after Beric:

&gt;Ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon's misshapen throne. His eyes searched the faces along the wall. ""Lord Beric,"" he called out.** ""Thoros of Myr.** Ser Gladden. Lord Lothar."" The men named stepped forward one by one. ""Each of you is to assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregor's keep. Twenty of my own guards shall go with you. Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the command, as befits your rank."" -AGOT, Eddard XI

***

**Realizing R'hllor's Power:**

So I guess what I am getting at is this badass drunk who was set to try and convert Aerys II to the Red God, has basically stopped believing (the opposite of Aeron Greyjoy who started off the other way) all of a sudden comes **face to face with his god**:

&gt;""I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time, his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I knew there was no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave him the good god's own kiss to send him on his way. I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him, down his throat to lungs and heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord's servants as they died. I had given it a time or two myself, as all priests must. **But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come open. It was not me who raised him, my lady. It was the Lord. R'hllor is not done with him yet. Life is warmth, and warmth is fire, and fire is God's and God's alone.""** -ASOS, Arya VII

***

With that in mind, everything he has ever learned about R'hllor is probably coming back to him and he has to  not only be in awe, but a little terrified due to things like this:

&gt;Melisandre put her hand on the king's arm. **""The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more precious.** From his king's blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born."" -ASOS, Davos V

We see him growing more and more depressed as well:

&gt;""Justice."" Thoros smiled wanly. ""I remember justice. It had a pleasant taste. **Justice was what we were about when Beric led us, or so we told ourselves. We were king's men, knights, and heroes . . . but some knights are dark and full of terror, my lady. War makes monsters of us all.**"" -AFFC, Brienne VIII

and:

&gt;He looked down at his ragged robes, and smiled ruefully. ""The pink pretender, rather. **I am Thoros, late of Myr, aye . . . a bad priest and a worse wizard.**""-AFFC, Brienne VIII

I think it can be inferred that Thoros is ashamed of some of his actions and while it could be just the hanging without trials and Lady Stoneheart, it could also be alluded to things that his ""god"" requires.

***

There is also plenty that the ""Lord of Light"" has shown him that has not been revealed to the reader:

&gt;Yet I am not the false priest you knew. **The Lord of Light has woken in my heart. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land. I have seen them in my flames.**"" -ASOS, Arya VI



**TLDR: Thoros has come to terms with the power of his ""god"" and while nothing scares him, it seems to truly terrify him and he has become ashamed of his recent past actions and/or possible future ones.**",asoiaf,A Man Meeting His God: Thoros and R'hllor (Spoilers Extended)

Sounds a lot like how *Lady* Ashara Dayne threw herself from a tower after Ned brought back news from the Tower of Joy and the Trident. 

In Dance, Ser Barristan mentions that someone wronged or scorned her at Harrenhal, and she turned to Stark for comfort. I saw a theory that proposed the man was none other than Rhaegar, who may have slept with Ashara at some point. She was Elia’s handmaiden after all, and was sent away. If that was the reason, it could explain House Dayne and House Martell’s chilly relations. Also, she likely harbored love for Rhaegar even after she was sent away. This could be why she threw herself off the tower after hearing of his death at the Trident. 

If we adjust our tinfoil hats, we could also postulate that Daenerys could be the daughter of Ashara and Rhaegar. It’s entirely possible that Dany could be older than we or even she thinks. 

The story of her birth is odd since it involved a massive storm that shook the castle and ripped grotesques and gargoyles off the battlements. Except, no other character recalls that storm. Dany hears the story from the manipulative Viserys, who could easily be lying or could be misinformed himself. 

There *was* a storm of sorts that could have ripped the battlements apart, however, in the form of an invasion by *storm*lord Stannis Baratheon. Perhaps that is the storm that gave Dany her name?

**Lets look for any instances of ""magic"" associated with the Faith of the Seven**

***

**Arrival of the Targaryens**

The High Septon claims to have been spoken to by the gods, but keep in mind a logical person should have been able to reach this same conclusion without any magic or divine intervention.

&gt;To the west, Aegon Targaryen met a warmer welcome. The greatest city in all of Westeros, Oldtown was ringed about with massive walls and ruled by the Hightowers of Hightower, the oldest, richest, and most powerful of the noble houses of the Reach. Oldtown was also the center of the Faith. There dwelt the High Septon, Father of the Faithful, the voice of the new gods on earth, who commanded the obedience of millions of the devout throughout the realms (save in the North, where the old gods still held sway), and the blades of the Faith Militant, the fighting orders the smallfolk called the Stars and Swords.

&gt;Yet when Aegon Targaryen and his host approached Oldtown, they found the city gates open, and Lord Hightower waiting to make his submission. **As it happened, when word of Aegon's landing first reached Oldtown, the High Septon had locked himself within the Starry Sept for seven days and seven nights, seeking after the guidance of the gods. He took no nourishment but bread and water, it was said, and spent all his waking hours in prayer, moving from one altar to the next. And on the seventh day, the Crone had lifted her golden lamp to show him the path ahead. If Oldtown took up arms against Aegon the Dragon, His High Holiness saw, the city would surely burn, and the Hightower and the Citadel and the Starry Sept would be cast down and destroyed**. -TWOIAF, The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest

***

**Trial of  Seven**

The [Trial of Seven](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_of_seven) is a form of trial by combat.

&gt;It is another form of trial by combat. Ancient, seldom invoked. It came across the narrow sea with the Andals and their seven gods. **In any trial by combat, the accuser and accused are asking the gods to decide the issue between them. The Andals believed that if the seven champions fought on each side, the gods, being thus honored, would be more like to take a hand and see that a just result was achieved.**"" -The Hedge Knight

I've posted about an upcoming [Trial by Combat](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dl8e9f/trial_by_combat_the_faiths_champion_spoilers/) and it is very possible that Cersei's trial or even [Jaime/Brienne's current situation](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ey87np/surviving_lady_stoneheart_theories_welcome/) could end up being solved this way.

But as of right now we know of two instances where this occurred: (Maegor/Duncan the Tall).

- **Maegor** (from the wiki)

&gt;In 42 AC during the Faith Militant uprising, Ser Damon Morrigen, the Grand Captain of the Warrior's Sons challenged King Maegor I Targaryen to a trial of seven, believing the right to rule the Seven Kingdoms did not belong to Maegor. Maegor accepted the challenge, and faced Damon and six other Warrior's Sons. The man-at-arms Dick Bean inspired five knights to defend the king. While the tales about the trial are often contradictory, they all agree that Maegor was the last one standing. However, Maegor was severely injured by the last of the Warrior's Sons, fell to the ground shortly after killing his last opponent, and was unconscious for several weeks.

It seems that while Maegor survived, some type of outside magic was involved. Tyanna of the Tower and his mother Visenya were both reputed to be involved in black magic. After he awoke from his coma (or was possibly resurrected), he used Balerion to burn the [Sept of Remebrance](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Burning_of_the_Sept_of_Remembrance).

- **Duncan the Tall** (from the wiki)

The plot of the *Hedge Knight*

&gt;A trial of seven, the first in a century, occurred during the tourney at Ashford Meadow in 209 AC. After a hedge knight named Ser Duncan the Tall attacked Prince Aerion Targaryen in defense of a Tanselle, a Dornish puppeteer, Duncan was challenged to a trial by seven. Duncan was accused by both Aerion and his older brother, Prince Daeron Targaryen, who had falsely accused Duncan of having kidnapped Prince Aegon Targaryen. After Daeron was defeated and Aerion withdrew his accusation during the trial, Duncan was declared innocent. However, the popular Prince Baelor Targaryen was mortally wounded in the trial by his brother, Prince Maekar.

**Baelor the Blessed**

The story of Baelor walking to Sunspear and retrieving the Dragonknight is well known and probably has some later details added to make it more religious:

&gt;As an act of piety, he declared, he would go to Dorne ""with neither sword nor army,"" to return their hostages and sue for peace. And so he did, walking barefoot from King's Landing to Sunspear, clad only in sackcloth, while the hostages rode fine horses behind him.

&gt;There are many songs of Baelor's journey to Dorne that found their way out of septries and motherhouses to spill from the tongues of singers. Mounting the Stone Way, Baelor soon came to the place where the Wyls had imprisoned his cousin Prince Aemon. He found the Dragonknight naked in a cage. It is said that Baelor pleaded, but Lord Wyl refused to free Aemon, forcing His Grace instead to offer a prayer for his cousin and swear that he would return. Many generations since have wondered just what Prince Aemon must have thought of this, seeing his reedy-voiced, slender kinsman—haggard and with bare, bleeding feet—making this promise. And yet Baelor pressed on and survived the Boneway, which had proved the undoing for many thousands before him.

&gt;The crossing of the desert between the northern foothills and the Scourge on foot, practically alone, nearly undid him. And yet he persevered. It was an arduous journey, but he survived to meet with the Prince of Dorne in what some consider to be the first miracle of Blessed Baelor's reign. And the second miracle might well be that he succeeded in forging a peace with Dorne that lasted throughout his reign. As part of the terms of the agreement, Baelor agreed that his young cousin Daeron—grandson of his Hand, Viserys, and the son of Viserys's eldest son Prince Aegon—should be betrothed to Princess Mariah, eldest child of the Prince of Dorne. Both were children at the time, so the marriage was to take place when they were of age.

&gt;After a sojourn in the Old Palace of Sunspear, the Prince of Dorne offered Baelor a galley to take him back to King's Landing. **However, the young king insisted that the Seven had commanded him to walk**. Some in the Dornish court feared that Prince Viserys would take it as a new cause for war when (not if) Baelor died upon the road, so the prince made every effort to make certain that the Dornish lords along the route would be hospitable. When he mounted the Boneway, Baelor turned his attention to recovering Prince Aemon from his imprisonment. He had asked the Dornish prince to explicitly command the Dragonknight's release, and this Lord Wyl accepted. **Yet instead of freeing Aemon himself, he gave Baelor the key to Aemon's cage, and an invitation to use it. But now, not only was Aemon naked in a cage, exposed to the hot sun by day and the cold wind by night, but also a pit had been dug beneath the cage, and within it were many vipers. The Dragonknight is said to have begged for the king to leave him, to go and seek aid in the Dornish Marches instead, but Baelor is said to have smiled and told him that the gods would protect him. Then he stepped into the pit.**

&gt;**Later, the singers claimed that the vipers bowed their heads to Baelor as he passed, but the truth is otherwise. Baelor was bitten half a dozen times while crossing to the cage, and though he opened it, he nearly collapsed before the Dragonknight was able to thrust open the door and pull his cousin from the pit.** The Wyls are said to have laid wagers as Prince Aemon struggled to climb out of the cage with Baelor flung across his back, and perhaps it was their cruelty that spurred him to climb to the top of the cage and leap to safety.

&gt;Prince Aemon carried Baelor halfway down the Boneway before a village septon in the Dornish mountains gave him clothing and an ass on which to carry the comatose king. Eventually Aemon reached the watchtowers of the Dondarrions, and then was conducted to Blackhaven, where the local maester cared for the king as best he could before sending them on to Storm's End for further treatment. And all the while, it is said, Baelor was wasting away, still lost to the world.

&gt;He only regained consciousness on the way to Storm's End, and then only to mutter prayers. It was half a year and more before he was well enough to travel on to King's Landing; and in all that time, Prince Viserys managed the realm as King's Hand, maintaining Baelor's peace treaty with the Dornish. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Baelor I

**Storming of the Dragonpit**

Like most of the others on this list there is a more reasonable answer, but some people believe that the Faith helped them kill the dragons:

&gt;Young Joffrey Velaryon, the Prince of Dragonstone, plummeted to his death when trying to ride his mother's dragon, Syrax, to the Dragonpit in order to save his own dragon, Tyraxes. Neither dragon survived. Wild tales and rumors followed about the deaths of the dragons: that some were hewn down by men, others by the Shepherd, **others by the Warrior himself.** Whatever the truth, five dragons died that bloody night as the mobs broke into the huge dome and found the dragons chained, and people perished in droves. Half the dragons that began the Dance were already dead, and the war was not yet over. Rhaenyra fled the city shortly after. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon II

***

**Summerhall**

During the attempted dragon hatching/blood magic ritual at Summerhall, we know that not only was a septon present, but they used 7 eggs for the 7 gods:

&gt;...the blood of the dragon gathered in one... ...**seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned**... ...pyromancers... ...wild fire... ...flames grew out of control...towering...burned so hot that... ...died, but for the valor of the Lord Comman... -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon V

Obviously it went wrong (sorcery is like a hilt, there is no safe way to grasp it), and it was not solely tied to the Faith of the Seven.

***

**Possible Ties to Other Religions**

&gt;Even as she set the quill aside and asked for sealing wax, Catelyn sensed that the letter was like to be too little and too late. Maester Vyman did not believe Lord Hoster would linger long enough for a raven to reach the Eyrie and return. Though he has said much the same before . . . Tully men did not surrender easily, no matter the odds. After she entrusted the parchment to the maester's care, Catelyn went to the sept and lit a candle to the Father Above for her own father's sake, **a second to the Crone, who had let the first raven into the world when she peered through the door of death**, and a third to the Mother, for Lysa and all the children they had both lost. -ASOS, Catelyn I 

and:

&gt;""**The Father reached his hand into the heavens and pulled down seven stars**,"" Tyrion recited from memory, ""and one by one he set them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill to make a glowing crown."" -ADWD, Tyrion II

and:

&gt;""I fear no shade, ser. It is written in **The Seven-Pointed Star that spirits, wights, and revenants cannot harm a pious man, so long as he is armored in his faith.**"" -AFFC, Jaime III

***

It should be noted that there are numerous tales that involve something happening 7 times, which is probably added later to make the story appeal to the Faith more (such as attempts to subdue Storm's End by  the Andals):

&gt;And besides the legendary kings and the hundreds of kingdoms from which the Seven Kingdoms were born, stories of such as Symeon Star-Eyes, Serwyn of the Mirror Shield, and other heroes have become fodder for septons and singers alike. Did such heroes once exist? It may be so. But when the singers number Serwyn of the Mirror Shield as one of the Kingsguard—an institution that was only formed during the reign of Aegon the Conqueror—we can see why it is that few of these tales can ever be trusted. **The septons who first wrote them down took what details suited them and added others**, and the singers changed them—sometimes beyond all recognition—for the sake of a warm place in some lord's hall. In such a way does some longdead First Man become a knight who follows the Seven and guards the Targaryen kings thousands of years after he lived (if he ever did). The legion of boys and youths made ignorant of the past history of Westeros by these foolish tales cannot be numbered. -TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Age of Heroes

There are also numerous events that are attributed by characters to the power of the Seven, but I still think there are logical explanations for each of them as well as theabove and unlike other religions, there are no true ""sources of magic"" tied to the Seven.

Maybe the best example of the Seven giving some influence is the fact that [Septon Barth is always right!](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/g3o153/septon_barth_is_always_right_spoilers_extended/), but he was more scholar than septon.

1479,"# Three-Eyed Crow

The Three-Eyed Crow is ""three-eyed"" because Brynden was known for his omniscience, hence ""a thousand eyes and one"". 

The ""crow"" part could come from his identity as a man of the Night's Watch, his raven-like birth mark, or the rumour that ""carrion crows spied for him and whispered secrets in his ear"".

The Three-Eyed Crow, which Bran encounters following his fall in the first book, is not some kind of mystical or eternal being. **The crow is a direct manifestation of the character of Brynden Rivers**.

# Winged Wolf

 Jojen says the following in aCoK:

&gt;""I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains,"" he said. ""It was a green dream, so I knew it was true. A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them."" 

Obviously Bran is the winged wolf, due to the Stark sigil and his link to ""flying"", and Brynden is once again a crow, trying to free Bran from him restraints.

&amp;#x200B;

# Greenseer Tradition

I hypothesise that **every greenseer has some kind of avatar which reflects their identity**. There was almost definitely another human connected to the weirwood throne before Brynden ventured north of the wall. This person would most likely have lured Brynden north of the wall with his own animal avatar, just as Brynden lured Bran with a three-eyed crow. There is probably a **chain of human greenseers connected to the weirwood net going back thousands of years**, each one finding their own replacement.

During Bran's first vision, he sees ""the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points"", which suggests that this process is far older than Bloodraven.

Brynden left the wall in the year 252, meaning that he was roughly 125 years old before appearing to weaken and require Bran as his replacement. We could speculate about who his predecessor was. Maybe Alys Rivers is a possibility, or someone else connected to magic and mysticism.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Extended] Greenseers and their Avatars - The Three-Eyed Crow and The Winged Wolf
1480,"Fair waring: this post is going to be kind of messy.

So we know that the battles of Ice and Fire were cut from ADWD for a couple reasons, the greatest being that they apparently would’ve resulted in the book being too big to be bound. We also know that the original ADWD was split into two separate books for similar reasons.

So...how is this not going to happen with TWOW? GRRM has said that TWOW is going to be huuuge. Wouldn’t the publishers be faced with the same problem? 

Let’s look at an example (one of many) of a long book that was successfully bound in a paperback version, Stephen King’s “The Stand.” The version of this book I read was paperback and over 1400 pages IIRC. I expect TWOW of winter to be long but I personally don’t think it will be as long as The Stand.

So...if GRRM is resisting the notion of splitting TWOW as he as said in the past, then TWOW should be able to be published as a single long book, RIGHT? But here are my issues.

If yes, then this essentially means that we were robbed of a much better ending in ADWD. If the editors/publishers had followed the same process that The Stand had went through for ADWD, then we would’ve been able to see the highly anticipated battles that were teased throughout then annoyingly cut. So does this mean this happened because the editors/publishers wanted to save money for a book that was surely going to be selling in high numbers? This is almost a question that I don’t want the answer to.

If no, then it would be even more infuriating. We would’ve waited all this time for a book just to learn that we have to wait even longer so they can figure out how to split it into two separate books just like Feast/Dance. If the answer is indeed no, it better be because TWOW turned out to be a huuuuuuuuge book (bigger than the Stand for example).

The point I am trying to make is that regardless of the answer to the question of TWOW being published as a single book, there are going to be things that make me frustrated. Thanks for reading this long vent session.

TL;DR: ADWD most likely could’ve been published with the battles of Ice and Fire ESPECIALLY if it is announced that TWOW is going to be a single novel.",asoiaf,TWOW publication parameters(spoilers extended)
1481,"Here is a long quote from *AGOT*, followed by some questions and some tinfoil-hatted ideas. (TLDR at end. Warning: surety level: INCONCLUSIVE; significance level: EXTREMELY MINOR.)

&gt; Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp. ""Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,"" he said as they sat. An empty wine cup stood on the table before him.

&gt; ""And to you, singer,"" Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were going, and from whence they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer. ""We left King's Landing a fortnight ago,"" Catelyn replied, answering the safest of his questions.

&gt; ""That's where I'm bound,"" the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. ""The Hand's tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry … or would have, if I hadn't lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.""

&gt; ""The gods frown on the gambler,"" Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments.

&gt; ""They frowned on me, for certain,"" the singer said. ""Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in.""

&gt; ""No doubt that was a lesson for you,"" Ser Rodrik said.

&gt; ""It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.""

&gt; Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat mushrooms. Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer.

&gt; ""My name is Marillion,"" the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. ""Doubtless you've heard me play somewhere?""

&gt; His manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell, but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. ""I fear not,"" she told him.

&gt; He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. ""That is your loss,"" he said. ""Who was the finest singer you've ever heard?""

&gt; ""Alia of Braavos,"" Ser Rodrik answered at once.

&gt; ""Oh, I'm much better than that old stick,"" Marillion said. ""If you have the silver for a song, I'll gladly show you.""

&gt; ""I might have a copper or two, but I'd sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,"" Ser Rodrik groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword.

&gt; ""Your grandfather has a sour nature,"" Marillion said to Catelyn. ""I meant to do you honor. An homage to your beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.""

&gt; ""Oh, I can see that,"" Catelyn said. ""Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doubt you've been to Riverrun.""

&gt; ""A hundred times,"" the singer said airily. ""They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a brother.""

&gt; Catelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. ""And Winterfell?"" she asked him. ""Have you traveled north?""

&gt; ""Why would I?"" Marillion asked. ""It's all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves.""

-- *AGOT*, Catelyn V

We're reminded that the Hand's tourney is coming up. Ser Rodrik says something ""sternly"", and Cat explains his sternness thusly: ""He was of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments.""

But is this why Ser Rodrik is stern?

**TOURNEYS**

Ned frowns on tourneys, and tourneys are not popular in the North. Does it therefore follow that the North frowns on tourneys as much as Ned does? Perhaps not. Look who brings up tourneys at the first opportunity:

&gt; ""The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,"" Jory said as he resumed his seat. ""They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King.""

&gt; Arya could see that her father was not very happy about that. ""Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?""

Why, it's Ser Rodrik's own nephew, Jory. Once Ned leaves the room, the conversation among these northmen immediately turns back to tourneys:

&gt; After he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. Down the table Jory laughed at a joke, and Hullen started in about horseflesh. ""Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the joust. Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all."" The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, and Hullen's son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine.

-- *AGOT*, Arya II

""The men had heard it all before"". Later, at the Hand's tourney:

&gt; Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. ...[Jory] acquitted himself well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In his third match, he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his own. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune's lance was steadier and his blows better placed, and the king gave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann.

-- *AGOT*, Sansa II

Jory again. Harwin, too, who later tells us that ""There's nought like a tourney to make the blood run hot,"" which suggests a degree of familiarity with tourneys.

And yet Harwin is not quite 30 years old, so if the North has no tourneys, and Harwin's been at Winterfell all his life, is this a second-hand opinion? Or is the Northern aversion to tourneys perhaps overstated?

A smaller, weaker clue:

&gt; She had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life, had viewed half a hundred tourneys in her time...

-- *AGOT*, Catelyn VII

Catelyn's about 35, and has been mostly at Winterfell for the preceding 15 years. Let's say she doesn't remember anything before she was 5: using maths, we can therefore compute that she witnessed 3.3 recurring tourneys annually between approximately 269 and 284 AC. Except that two of those years include a terrible war, so that must really be 3.87 tourneys a year between 269 and 282. Even granting that she was rounding up to 50, and that some of the 50 had occurred during southron travels post-284, that's still too many tourneys.

Point being: it's not inconceivable that the occasional tourney happens north of the Neck. Just because Ned hates them...

(...and I wonder if this has something to do with the tourney at Harrenhal. You know, the one that led to Ned's whole family getting killed? The one where he met Ashara Dayne? The one he's never once spoken about to his children?...)

...and just because they're not popular in the North, doesn't mean that they never happen there, or that good Northmen might not travel south to compete on occasion. We even have textual precedent, in Gregor Clegane, of a man ""who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys"" - and I might add that Catelyn's remark, ""He was of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments,"" actually does admit this possibility as well: the second half of that sentence sounds like it's conditional on the first, but, actually that's not necessarily the case, is it?

And of all Northmen who participate in this southron cultural institution, we might most expect it of **Ser** Rodrik Cassel, the anointed knight whose nephew also seems interested in tourneys.

**SINGERS**

But if Catelyn is wrong - if she ""knows nothing"" - about Ser Rodrik's views on tourneys, then why's he obviously in a bad mood?

And he is in a bad mood, seemingly from the moment he sits down:

* ""...in a tone that meant now.""
* ""...sternly.""
* chastises Marillion
* tugs whiskers
* grouses
* ""sour""

Hey, wait - he's sat down across from Marillion, the singer. Maybe he just doesn't like singers?

Okay, fair enough, he is feeling some ""exasperation"" prior to meeting Marillion. Maybe he's just had a rough day. Well, he has. It's cold and rainy, and he doesn't think it's safe at this inn.

But wait again - didn't Catelyn say he didn't like singers? Yes, she did:

&gt; His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword.

-- *AGOT*, Catelyn V

Hmm... You know who else hates singers, albeit for a different reason? Cat's brother.

And isn't this interesting? This detail is mentioned immediately thereafter, with Cat risking blowing her own cover just to crowbar it in there. Hmm...

Even more interesting: Cat ""knows nothing"" about her brother's views on singers, too. She thinks:

&gt; Another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since.

-- *AGOT*, Catelyn V

But later, we hear from that ""other singer"", and he sings a different song:

&gt; ""If we go to Riverrun... Be thankful if you get out with your hide. Lord Hoster was hanging outlaws before you were shaving. And that son of his . . . a man who hates music can't be trusted, I always say.""

&gt; ""It's not music he hates,"" said Lem. ""It's you, fool.""

&gt; ""Well, he has no cause. The wench was willing to make a man of him, is it my fault he drank too much to do the deed?""

&gt; Lem snorted through his broken nose. ""Was it you who made a song of it, or some other bloody arse in love with his own voice?""

&gt; ""I only sang it the once,"" Tom complained. ""And who's to say the song was about him? 'Twas a song about a fish.""

&gt; ""A floppy fish,"" said Anguy, laughing.

-- *ASOS*, Arya IV

(Fun fact: tourneyman Harwin is also in that scene.)

We can see why Catelyn would believe Edmure's version, though: singers are notorious hound-dogs, as Marillion's own subsequent career can attest to; ditto Dareon, Mance, Bael the Bard; perhaps even Rhaegar.

But if Catelyn's wrong about why one man hates singers, might she be wrong about why another man hates them? Especially a man who she perhaps does not know as well as she thinks she does?

**ALIA OF BRAAVOS**

&gt; ""Who was the finest singer you've ever heard?""

&gt; ""Alia of Braavos,"" Ser Rodrik answered at once.

Who's Alia of Braavos?

[The wiki says](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alia) she's a woman. Marillion says she's old, like Ser Rodrik. That Marillion says anything means he's heard of her, which means she's famous. We know singers sometimes visit Winterfell, despite what Marillion says. Beyond that, we can only speculate.

Why did Ser Rodrik answer ""at once""?

We can only speculate there, too...

Perhaps she's a singer who visited Winterfell, or perhaps he heard her elsewhere in Westeros - perhaps at a tourney. (I suspect not at Braavos: for one, the appellation ""of Braavos"" makes no sense in Braavos; for another, Ser Rodrik gets very seasick, and, unless I'm misreading things, he discovers this for the first time on his voyage to King's Landing with Catelyn.)

Perhaps another man - perhaps another singer - ""bedded"" the ""girl [he] fancied"", this Alia of Braavos. Perhaps the whole experience had left a ""sour"" taste in his mouth. (Perhaps like the food he is currently eating.) Perhaps that's why ""he had hated the breed ever since,"" and why also he still thought music was a lovely thing for girls, but not for boys.

And perhaps he's still holding a candle for this enchantress, all these years later, that he answers ""at once"" that she's the [finest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9Kaa1sycs) singer he'd ever heard.

**TLDR: SER RODRIK HAS A MILDLY INTERESTING PAST, MAYBE**

Crazy idea #1: Braavos has moonsingers. Moonsingers are basically witches, from an eastern religion. You know who else is a hot sexy eastern witch? Melisandre - real name Melody...

Crazy idea #2: Ser Rodrik calls Marillion's singing ""howling"". Marillion later says ""...the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves."" Singers do go to Winterfell on occasion. Therefore, is Alia a wolf in some sense? Alia of Braavos: isn't there a wolf in Braavos whose name kind of rhymes with ""Alia""?...

Update #1:  Catelyn remarks that Rodrik ""was of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments."" The second half of that sentence sounds like it's conditional on the first, but, actually that's not necessarily the case, is it? Another classic case of GRRM using syntax to mislead the reader?",asoiaf,"[Spoilers Extended] Ser Rodrik Cassel, of the North, who thinks music is for girls"
1482,"So in the years since the Pink Letter was dropped, there have been numerous theories about who actually wrote it. In fact my introduction to ASOIAF theories was via YouTuber Preston Jacobs' ""Who wrote the Pink Letter"" video. He settled on Mance as has dozens of other theories I have read or watched. And I must give the theorist credit for parsing through every line and word choice to make such a compelling argument. I just have the one question that I've never seen addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Is Mance Rayder literate?\*

Obviously if Mance Rayder wrote the Pink Letter, he must be able to read and write. So how did he learn this skill? The story is that Mance is the bastard of a Night's Watch man and a Wildling woman who was taken as a child when the NW killed a group of raiders. Mance was raised to the Black, became a fearless ranger who still longed for the freedom of his childhood and eventually deserted the NW. So how did he learn to read and write during all this?

I really think this deserves some deeper analysis. Literacy is an important theme in ASOIAF. The vast majority of people in Westeros are unlettered. Literacy is most often found in the highborn, those who serve the highborn in a capacity other than physical labor (stewards, maesters), and in some of the better merchants.

Literacy is an important theme on the Wall. It was Sam Tarley's literacy that helped him supplant Chet. And later earned his spot on the great ranging. Jon often remarks how few brothers can write. It does not appear that anyone on the Wall was bothering to teach brothers to read. Chet was Maester Aemon's stewart for years and niether he nor Clydas seemed to have saw any need to teach Chet. You'd think they would at least try.I can't see how the NW would teach rangers to read when they are not teaching stewards. And I can't think of a single Wildling that has displayed literacy. So how did Mance learn to read a write so well?

\*The PL isn't amateurish.\*

The content of that letter does not give evidence of a moderately proficient writer. The letter is free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. The author did not even struggle with homophones like Raider v Rayder or Their v There. GRRM took the time to remind us that beginner readers don't read or write without errors when walking us through Davos and his quest to become literate.

Besides the correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation, there is an undeniable eloquence to the letter. It is focused. It begins with the death of the King and his friends, moves on to the plots of Lord Commander Snow, speaks of threats to Mance, then lists demands, and finally consequences. That speaks to someone who knows how to organize his writing and that only comes with education, practice, and lots of reading. How did Mance gain these skills?

\*Of ink, quill, and ravens.\*

If Mance did write the letter, how did he send it out? I suppose he could have learned that ravens carry messages from his time with the NW, but how did he learn how to use ink and quill. Ink needs to be unstoppered (not hard I grant), and sometimes heated before use (also not difficult to discover but perhaps hard to do while the castle is on high alert). How did he learn that? And how did he learn to use a raven? Ravens are specially trained to carry a message to a specific location. Most ravens are one way birds that fly to one home location. How would Mance at Winterfell know which cage of ravens are the Castle Black ravens?  I suppose one could argue that Mance forced a maester to help him, but unless he killed or kidnapped the man, how could he keep the secret silent? And how could he verify the maester even did what he asked? If Mance can't read, the maester could have written ""send help"" and put that on a Dreadfor bird. And why would the maester be so neat elsewhere but then smear pink wax on the parchment?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Conclusion\*

I suppose that Mance could be literate despite growing up in two societies that don't invest in education, but I really wish something in the book offered a clue as to how that came to be. So for those of you who support the theory that Mance wrote the PL, can you help me understand how he satisfies the literacy requirement? And please don't say he is secretly Rheagar, or Ser Author Dayne, or that Bran warged him unless you have damn good text to back that up. :-)

Seriously this has bugged me for years. I enjoy the Mance wrote the PL theories but I can't get my head around the literacy problem. If you know of a theory that tackles this, please share. I'd love to read it.

1489,"Sorry if this has been discussed before but I got curious so I wanted to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

Ned once mentioned how Robert remembers what he says while drunk and will not take back his words after ( unless I'm misunderstanding ) :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ser Barristan's look was troubled. ""They say night's beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""They say so,"" Ned agreed, ""but **not of** **Robert**."" **Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, remembering, would never back down**. - AGOT, Eddard VII

But later, Jaime refutes this claim :

&gt;""Oh, don't be absurd."" Cersei closed the window. ""Yes, I hoped the boy would die. So did you. Even Robert thought that would have been for the best. 'We kill our horses when they break a leg, and our dogs when they go blind, but we are too weak to give the same mercy to crippled children,' he told me. He was blind himself at the time, from drink.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**Robert**? **Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in his cups that he would have denied angrily the next day**. ""Were you alone when Robert said this?"" - ASOS, Jaime IX

&amp;#x200B;

I think **Jorah Mormont** will likely come out of the book series alive.  If the Wall is destroyed but a Night's Watch is still needed (like on the show), I could easily see Jorah commanding them after the Long Night, in some ways following in his father's footsteps and rebounding the honor of his family.  On the show, I just get the sense that Jorah was killed off as an excuse for Daenerys to go insane.  In the books, however, I feel like Dany's downfall will unfold differently (details are perhaps better suited for a different topic).

On the flip side, I could see GRRM killing off **Arya Stark**, something that D&amp;D might have been too hesitant with.  Throughout Arya's arc, one of the things that remain consistent is that she's the lone wolf of the pack.  In some ways, I feel like this is foreshadowing that Arya will sacrifice herself at Winterfell as a means to keep the rest of the pack together and safe.  On the show, Arya ""traveling west of Westeros"" would've worked had the rest of the pack stayed together; however, all four of them are separated by the end of the series, which just came across as goofy to me.",asoiaf,"[Spoilers EXTENDED] Who will survive the book series that died on the show, and vice versa"
1491,"So Maester Luwin doesn't get discussed very often, but I came across some comments on this forum, to the tune of 'Maester Luwin was not a very good guy, and certainly not as good as he appears to be at first glance, because he was an agent of the Citadel and believed in its effort to snuff out magic and tried to stop Bran from warging etc etc', and these well high rated comments, making it appear that a lot of people agreed with this sentiment. 

Now i was very surprised with this, because I always saw Maester Luwin as a kind and caring character. Maybe he had been indoctrinated into the Citadel's anti magic stance, and espoused similar views, but nothing he did ever seemed to be negatively intended. If he ever tried to suppress magic, it was based in his own experience and never a concerted effort to further the Citadel's designs. 

Sure, he tells Bran to ignore and suppress his dreams, but if you were a thinking adult who'd never seen magic in his life, wouldn't you tell the 9 year cripple who dreams of flying to also ignore his dreams. Luwin seems like a rationalist/scientific minded person to me, who believes things with empirical evidence (which is fair) and he has never seen magic before in his life, and what he says actually makes a lot of sense - he says that The CotF had magic, but lost to the First Men and the Andals because they had bronze weapons and horses, so don't rely on something as fickle as magic. He is not an irrational denier, and he is surprised when Bran and Rickon dream the same dream before Ned's death, but rationalises it (fairly, imo) by telling Bran that 'think of the thousand other dreams which you've had, which didn't come true'. And when Jojen dreams of the sea coming to Winterfell, Luwin doesn't dismiss them off hand, and points that they've got reports of raiding ships on the Stony shore (though they don't know that these are IB yet). 

All in all, he seems like a regular smart person trying his best to make sense of forces beyond his comprehension, and tries to guide the Stark kids the best he can, and certainly doesn't seem like an agent of the Citadel.

1492,"In ADWD, young Big Walder is killed under mysterious circumstances and his murder is blamed on House Manderly, causing a small fight between the Freys and Manderlys within Winterfell that escalates with Wyman having his throat slit;

&gt;""So young,"" said Wyman Manderly. ""Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.""
Ser Hosteen slammed his foot into the tabletop, knocking it off its trestles, back into Lord Wyman's swollen belly. Cups and platters flew, sausages scattered everywhere, and a dozen Manderly men came cursing to their feet. Some grabbed up knives, platters, flagons, anything that might serve as a weapon.
Ser Hosteen Frey ripped his longsword from its scabbard and leapt toward Wyman Manderly. The Lord of White Harbor tried to jerk away, but the tabletop pinned him to his chair. **The blade slashed through three of his four chins in a spray of bright red blood.** Lady Walda gave a shriek and clutched at her lord husband's arm. ""Stop,"" Roose Bolton shouted. ""Stop this madness."" His own men rushed forward as the Manderlys vaulted over the benches to get at the Freys. One lunged at Ser Hosteen with a dagger, but the big knight pivoted and took his arm off at the shoulder. Lord Wyman pushed to his feet, only to collapse. Old Lord Locke was shouting for a maester as **Manderly flopped on the floor like a clubbed walrus in a spreading pool of blood.** Around him dogs fought over sausages.

Following the fight, Roose Bolton orders his maester to tend to Wyman Manderly's wounds whilst the Manderly soldiers are sent out to fight Stannis alongside the Freys who just warned that they would finish off killing Wyman after they are done with Stannis;

&gt;Hosteen Frey's sword was red almost to the hilt. Blood spatters speckled his cheeks like freckles. He lowered his blade and said, ""As my lord commands. But after I deliver you the head of Stannis Baratheon, I mean to finish hacking off Lord Lard's.""
Four White Harbor knights had formed a ring around Lord Wyman, as Maester Medrick labored over him to staunch his bleeding. ""First you must needs come through us, ser,"" said the eldest of them, a hard-faced greybeard whose bloodstained surcoat showed three silvery mermaids upon a violet field.
""Gladly. One at a time or all at once, it makes no matter.""

Now, things don't look particularly good for Lord Too Fat to Sit a Horse, and its probably certain that he went into Winterfell with the intention of stirring up conflict and getting himself killed. But without his soldiers protecting him inside Winterfell, his survival odds look short. Even worse, he is now being tended to by Roose Bolton's maester in Winterfell and given the food shortages in the castle, Roose may order his maester to quietly kill off Wyman in his sleep without anyone looking and blame it on the Freys to ensure one less mouth to feed. All in all, the War for the North is going to be bloody, and Wyman Manderly stands a strong chance of being another one of its likely next casualties.

1496,"OK, so I just read this rundown of how Dany’s backstory is garbage.

https://thelasthearth.freeforums.net/thread/572/dany

I’d already been persuaded of Lemongate, and this added the piece of how she was likely “Stormborn” on the Summer Sea, not the Narrow Sea. 

I don’t particularly care who her parents were. She’s either Targaryen enough that she can hatch dragon eggs, controlled by a sorcerer so she can hatch and control dragons, or she’s a “dragonseed” in that, with or without Valyrian blood, she can show dragons love and receive their love in return. Identifying who provided her DNA isn’t going to be possible until GRRM wants us to know; all we can do right now is stipulate for the record: **Daenerys Targaryen is probably not who she claims to be, i.e. last-born child of Mad King Aerys and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella.** Whoever she was born as, she was likely tacked onto Viserys later in her life and given the title “Targaryen little sister and spare heir to the Iron Throne.”

And that leads us to a bigger question: **Why doesn’t a 13-year-old girl have any substantial memories of her past?** She remembers the house with the red door and the lemon tree. She has some hazy memories of a “Willem Darry” caregiver. She has some memories of being abused by Viserys, and she can recite things he’s told her. She has a memory of being on a ship, and supposedly she’s been carted around on a lunatic itinerary through Essos. She may or may not remember the vistas of Dorne. Quaithe, for whatever reason, quickly becomes a major presence in her subconscious. She is prone to disturbing dreams and visions of the past and the future.

When Illyrio first met her she was terrified, so let’s also assume that, whoever she is, had a ton of childhood trauma and instability. Traumatized children disassociate and some of them have trouble forming long-term memories.

**But all that said, most kids from say, age 8 and up, are reasonably aware of the world around them and can form impressions and interpret events. Especially kids that are smart enough to learn fluent High Valyrian, fluent Common Tongue and, within short order, fluent-enough Dothraki.**

But when we meet Dany in book one, she’s almost like a blank slate. She doesn’t seem to have any kind of handle on where she’s been or who she’s been with. She must be terrified, sure, and GRRM may be working out the details of her identity as he writes, but there seems to be a tremendous amount of missing time in her personal history.

My question is *how* could she be so out of it? Was she drugged? Was she enchanted? Does she have brain damage from a head injury? There’s at least five years when she was in the same age range major characters like Bran, Arya, Sansa, Tommen and Sweetrobin, and yet unlike them she has formed no strong likes or dislikes, she seems to lack awareness of her body’s position in time and space, and she’s made no personal allies or enemies except Viserys (and maybe latecomer Ser Jorah).

So *why* is Dany so completely unconscious of her own life experience? Does anyone have any working theories?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Daenerys’ missing time

And hadn't Robert already set out on his ultimately fatal boar hunt when Ned confronted Cersei? Certainly the scheme for this particular arranged accident must have been underway before Ned's meeting with Cersei ever took place.

While it seems that this attack of stupidity certainly ended up getting Ned killed, I fail to see how it got Robert killed. In fact, it seems like Ned simply got majorly unlucky that one of Cersei's attempts on Robert's life actually happened to succeed at the worst possible time. And as far as the attempt itself, Cersei's plan to get Robert killed by getting him drunk during a hunt seems somewhat unreliable considering that a failure to kill him would have resulted in her family getting wiped out.

1508,"**Season 1**

1. We open on the tourney of 111 AC, celebrating the fifth wedding anniversary of Viserys and Alicent. Character ages are all kept as ambiguous as possible, but Rhaenyra is implied to be in her late teens. Rhaenyra and Alicent dress in black and green, giving names to their respective factions. Having acquired princess Rhaenyra's favour, Ser Criston Cole defeats Ser Gwayne Hightower and all other competition, winning the tourney. In honour of his victory, the king promotes Criston to Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. There is discussion of the king's brother Daemon, a violent and unpredictable man who is reviled by most members of court. Just as the excitement is dying down the prince himself appears atop a dragon wearing a crown, throwing the crowd into a panic. When the prince lands, however, he kneels before his brother and offers him the crown.
2. The brothers reconnect in the courtyard, to the relief of most attendees. When her father leaves Rhaenyra begins flirting with Daemon, evidently besotted with her (married) uncle. While clearly interested, Daemon does not respond out of respect for his brother. Later Viserys asks Daemon the status of his wife, Rhea Royce, who Daemon has not seen since he left for the Stepstones. Viserys suggests they make up, which Daemon curtly refuses. Daemon tells his brother that his war in the south is going poorly, as the Prince of Dorne has allied with the Triarchy against him. As Viserys in now ""King of the Stepstones,"" Daemon urges him to invade Dorne and defend this holding, while avenging Prince Morion's Madness. Viserys deduces that Daemon gave him the crown only to pressure him into a war, and so refuses. The king forbids his brother from returning to the Stepstones, and later reinstalls him as Lord Commander of the City Watch. An angry Daemon begins an affair with Princess Rhaenyra, which is suspected by Queen Alicent. She asks Ser Arryk Cargyll of the Kingsguard to investigate the two, and he eventually catches them having sex.
3. Furious at what has happened, Viserys exiles his brother and forcibly betroths Rhaenyra to Laenor Velaryon, threatening to remove her as heir if she refuses. Knowing Rhaenyra is being betrothed against her will, Criston Cole offers to marry the princess himself and run away with her. Rhaenyra refuses, mindful of her father's threat. Daemon flies back to the Stepstones, but finds that most of his kingdom was taken from him in his absence. Rhaenyra and Laenor marry despite their spectacular disinterest in one another, mutually agreeing not to sleep even in the same room on their wedding night. Laenor spends the night with his male favourite Ser Joffrey Lonmouth, while Rhaenyra spites her father by having sex with Ser Harwin Strong.
4. A tourney is held to celebrate the wedding, with Criston Cole now wearing Queen Alicent's favour. Cole again wins, ferociously wounding Harwin Strong and accidentally killing Joffrey Lonmouth. Rhaenyra and Laenor begin living on seperate islands, while the former becomes pregnant by Ser Harwin. Word reaches Prince Daemon of the death of his wife, and he finally abandons the Stepstones to fly back to Runestone, which he tries and fails to claim as Lady Rhea's widower. From there he heads to Driftmark, where he kills the fiancee of Laena Velaryon, daughter of his old ally, Lord Corlys Velaryon. He then marries Laena himself and the two fly off together. 
5. Laena and Daemon adventure together in the Free Cities, with Laena eventually giving birth to twin daughters. Rhaenyra birthes the brown-haired Jacaerys Velaryon, while Queen Alicent gives birth to the silver-haired Daeron Targaryen. The queen shares with Viserys her suspicions about Jacaerys' paternity, but the king appears not to believe her.
6. Daemon and Laena are welcomed back to Westeros by King Viserys, against the wishes of queen and council. A subtle time skip occurs. Rhaenyra now has three brown-haired sons by Harwin, Laena's daughters are now three years old, and Alicent's elder sons are now 13 and 10. Laena Velaryon dies birthing a stillborn son, and Rhaenyra comforts Daemon in his grief. Not long after his sister's funeral, Ser Laenor is stabbed to death in a fight with one of his lovers.
7. The court gathers on Driftmark for Laenor's funeral, where the king announces plans to head to Dragonstone and find a mount for his son Aemond. Aemond instead succeeds in taming the massive Vhagar, but has his eye cut out by Lucerys Velaryon.
8. Viserys refuses to punish either of the princes for their actions, but announces he will take the tongue of anyone who question's his daughter's faithfulness. Rhaenyra fully relocates her court to Dragonstone, while Alicent remains in the Red Keep. Ser Harwin Strong is ordered to leave Dragonstone, and he and his father subsequently die in a fire at Harrenhal.
9. With both their spouses dead, Rhaenyra and Daemon begin courting on Dragonstone. After some deliberation, Alicent succeeds in convincing the king to reinstall her father, Ser Otto Hightower, as Hand of the King.
10. Ser Otto arrives to some fanfare, and takes up rule of the kingdom. To the fury of the court, Rhaenyra and Daemon get married on Dragonstone.

1518,"The POV chapters of Cersei have their good moments, but now I want to advocate the use of Margaery Tyrell as POV instead.

**How POV chapters mislead readers**

The perspective one gets from the outside world and the character himself from a POV is not neutral and therefore biased. We are inclined to support the POV character at all times, even if they do deeds that are morally questionable. The reader has insight into the thought patterns of the POV character and sees how they rationalize or justify actions, which gives a wrong perspective to the whole.

A strong example of how a POV character misleads the reader is Jon Snow's character arc in A Dance of Dragons. As Lord Commander, he is in charge of the management of the Night's Watch and the reception of Stannis Baratheon. He initially refuses to support the Northern resistance, even passively giving military advice - because interfering in the Game of the Thrones in the south would lead to a violation of the Night's Watch oath. Later he violates neutrality by switching babies, sending spies to Winterfell, negotiating for a loan for the benefit of Stannis and also publicly marrying Alys Karstark and Sigorn Thenn according to the principles of R'hillor - to eventually create a house (= public rebellion against the Boltons). We see more and more that Jon Snow is neglecti the Night Watch Oath, but we also see him constantly trying to give a new twist and meaning to the oath to justify his deed. When Jon Snow is murdered by his own men, we can either declare it unjust (""he had few other options"") or justify it (""Jon Snow's interference in foreign politics means the end of the Night Watch if there are retaliations). However, the reader is supposed to regard the murder as unjust because we see it from Jon's perspective and not that of for example Bowen Marsh. Because characters like Tyrion, Jaime and Daenerys have a POV perspective, we cheer them, but if not? 

**Why it doesn't work optimally at Cersei**

Cersei simply has a rather flawed conscience that cannot be justified (even though we know of the prophecy from her childhood that made her paranoid). Readers can't exactly be misled by her thinking, by a lack of subtlety. Cersei fails to make the reader hate the Tyrells, because her reasoning is so laughably transparent. What Cersei considers to be just, the reader sees as unjust and vice versa (and that will not change the coming books). With other POV characters, readers tend to justify and relativize less moral acts.

In reality, a narcissistic personality easily succeeds in binding people to themselves on the basis of charms, their eloquence and autonomy. At first it is not clear to the victims that narcissists will abuse, claim and manipulate them.  Narcissists glorify themselves and project all bad things onto the victim, usually by deliberately creating conflicts to degrade the victim. They are so good at this that the victim takes all the responsibility, retains his low self-esteem and becomes more and more submissive towards the narcissist. 

Narcissists know how to deceive and play with their prey until the victim (often after a very long time) becomes aware that the narcissist is guilty of destroying their personal identity. Cersei, also a narcissistic personality, no longer misleads the reader since we have her POV perspective. A missed opportunity.

 **The perspective of the victim**

George R. R. Martin has repeatedly expressed support for ""cripples, bastards and broken things"" and he is very good at writing storylines for such characters. I will explain in detail what to expect when looking at Cersei's storyline from the perspective of the victims:

1.	The narcissist puts the victim on a pedestal and floods her with false love and attention.

2.	The victim falls for the narcissist, believes in his good intentions and is bound to him.

3.	The narcissist creates a conflict to humiliate the victim, over and over again, so that their self-image is lowered.

4.	The victim takes all the responsibility and becomes submissive, hoping that the narcissist will behave as he was before.

5.	After a while the victim discovers some red flags and tries to confront them with threats (e.g. that the victim will leave the narcissist).

6.	After another violent conflict, the narcissist acts as if he regrets, flooding the victim again with false love and attention in order to reattach the victim.

7.	The cycle repeats itself.

Cersei focuses on three victims: Jaime, Tommen and Margaery. Jaime is only seen as an extension of Cersei's personality. Jaime had a blind loyalty to Cersei, until he was captured and forced to be escorted by another woman, Brienne. Jaime came to understand that with Brienne there is a balanced bond of friendship in which one respects each other, unlike with Cersei. He's the only one of the three to have broken the vicious circle of narcissistic abuse. Tommen can be called the ""black sheep"", who is always told by her mother that he is such a disapointment compared to ""the golden child"" Joffrey. Cersei sees Margaery as a threat to her ego, because she is much more popular as queen.

With Jaime we already have a perspective of a victim of narcissistic abuse, but since AGOT he is already beyond her direct influence. We only get to know how Jaime romanticized his former relationship with Cersei and was willing to do anything for her, including the murders of Bran and Robert. We don't see how the original relationship really was and only that he finally became disillusioned after she met her again in AFFC after his sword was cut off and he met Brienne.

With Margaery we could follow Cersei playing her from the beginning (her engagement to Joffrey). With her as a POV character, she will also be attracted to love and attention. Later she will be humiliated and take all the responsibility. If the POV character would think this, the reader would think the same and thus be deceived.  In the end Margaery and also the reader will unmask the narcissist. So Margaery as POV would give the reader a good picture of Cersei in the beginning, but as soon as her behaviour patterns become clearer, you will hate her more than ever before. 

**The benefits and drawbacks of a Margaery Tyrell POV.**

With Margaery Tyrell we also gain a lot more insight into the culture of The Reach and how the Tyrells and their banner men try to strengthen their political power in King's Landing. We get a better picture of the political intrigues led by Olenna/Mace Tyrell and those of Cersei will be concealed. The reader will get the false impression that Cersei is a good strategist, but later on, the shills will fall from the eyes. We also have a better view on Tommen, who has a very close bond with Margaery and shares sweet and suffering with her. Cersei's actions, e.g. the re-establishment of the Faith Militant and the council meetings, we can learn from second hand. Some of Cersei's former chapters, especially in the beginning of AFFC, can be seen through Jaime's perspective. Specific information can be passed on by Taena or Myr, assuming she's a spy of the Tyrells. In short: I have the feeling that we will miss little if we replace Cersei's POV with that of Margaery.",asoiaf,Why Margaery Tyrell would be a better POV instead of Cersei Lannister (Spoilers main) .
1520,"Let’s rewrite history and say we’re working with a more faithful television adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire. The first four seasons have covered the first three books, as in our reality. However, now that the time has come to adapt the remaining two novels (without leaving any major characters or plot-lines out), the only logical way to do it is to split the two concurrent books over two seasons. How do you split up the character arcs over Season 5 and 6 in a way that feels satisfying? Feel free to make alterations to the first four seasons/structure of first three books, if necessary.

Some ideas I’ve had or heard of/points of discussion:
- Jon doesn’t become Lord Commander till S5, like in our reality, except this time that comes at the very end. The election spans most of the season and Jon spends it regaining the trust of his sworn brothers and beginning to build relations with the wildlings again. S6 is LC Snow, ending with daggers in the dark.
- Tyrion meeting Young Griff is his S5 story, with Jorah kidnapping him at the end and that being the arc of S6.
- Arya goes blind at the end of S5 as in our timeline. She’s officially a Faceless Man by the end of S6, though still experiencing doubts.
- The Kingsmoot happens in S4, since that was its chronological placement in the books anyway. It also gives a greater connection to the Ironborn early on. Aeron is more of a focus. Maybe in S5, we actually see Euron go to Valyria (the real one, with F&amp;B-esc monsters to boot). We can also build some connection between him and Bran.
- Arianne’s AFFC plot happens in S5, ending with Doran’s reveal. S6 then starts off with Quentyn, half his triumphant quest already somewhat squandered, as in the books.
- fAegon takes Storm’s End at the end of S6 and prepares to march on the throne.

But how does Daenerys camp out in Meereen for two seasons without it getting ridiculously boring? Do we bring in those big TWOW battles as the S6 closer? We have two seasons to turn Sansa into a savvy political player by actually staying in the Vale, how do we make that interesting?

I feel that this question is really fascinating and allows fans to structure a series more faithful to the books. How would you pull it off?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) How would you adapt AFFC/ADWD across two seasons of Game of Thrones.
1525,"This is a nitpicky sort of post, so if my pedantry annoys you, pealse don't downboop, I really like GRRM's worldbuilding but think it would be even better if some aspects were thought out more.

The big aspect of agrarian societies is that most people die in the same village they were born, and furthest they ever travel is to a local town's fair. Such isolation leads to huge diversity of spoken dialects. In some places, even two neighboring counties could speak languages that are barely intelligible between the speakers. It is odd then how a single language is universally spoken throughout the entire continent.

We know that the First Men spoke the Old Tongue, but then Andals invaded and I assume the ""New Tongue"" is based on their language. But the North wasn't conquered! So Old Tongue should still be widely used there, just like Rhoynish in the Dorn, further emphasizing these region's difference from the rest of the kingdom. Riverlands should be a balkanized patchwork of different dialects since it sits in the middle of many regions and was colonized by Ironborn at one point.

You might ask ""But how would our characters talk to each other then?!"" Well, in real world, noblemen often spoke between each other in a foreign language of a culture that dominated the region, like Latin, or French, and often considered their local langue as low, peasants' tongue. So when Aegon conquered the continent, Westerosi noblemen would do well to learn High Valyrian.

It's not much, but I think it'd be cool if Catelyn struggled to speak Old Tongue because she were an outsider, or how Arya would struggle to communicate among commonfolk in Reverlands, showing the class disparity. Little things like these add up.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) Westeros is oddly monolingual...
1527,"Apart from the commonly named things (ageing characters up) and apart from making scenes more cinematic (for example, how the dialogue of Jaime &amp; Brienne's bathtub scene was altered), what are some smaller book-to-show changes that you think made a positive difference?

Here are two I thought of:

•Lancel outing Cersei instead of the Kettleblacks.
This might just be me who confuses the three brothers all the time, but I think leaving them out was wise.
With Cersei bedding both the Kettleblacks and her own cousin, it feels a bit overkill to have them all confess it. It didn't really matter that Cersei slept with Lancel, since she was going to be busted by the Kettleblacks anyway. With the way D&amp;D handled the plot, Cersei banging Lancel actually feels like it has consequences, which I really like.

•Merging Willas and Loras
So far, Willas hasn't done anything major in the books. His crippling does add to the enmity between Oberyn &amp; Mace, a rather short-lived book element that didn't make it into the show. Still, it would have been another name for the moms and NFL players to remember, made more difficult by the fact that Willas never visits King's Landing. Loras' brief betrothal to Sansa had the same effect without adding another character to the mix.
In the books unlike the show, Loras demands to be a Kingsguard right after the Battle of the Blackwater and Joffrey accepts. This of course creates the issue of Loras being an eligible bachelor since he's not a Kingsguard, which they neatly made into a short betrothal plot to Cersei (that is later brushed off when Tywin dies). I think they handled that one pretty well.",asoiaf,(Spoilers MAIN) Less frequently mentioned GoT decisions you approve of

???",asoiaf,( Spoilers Main) Any Cersei lover here?
1534,"So at the end of A Clash of Kings, Sir Dontos shows Sansa the hairnet in which the poison used to murder Joffrey was eventually stored. This suggests that at the very least Littlfinger was planning for it to be the way to sneak the poison in. 

At the beginning of A Storm of Swords though, the Tyrells plan on marrying Sansa to Willas as to take advantage of her. 

If Littlefinger and the Tyrells were working together, which we know they did since Olenna knew to take the poison from Sansa's hairnet, why did Olenna want to marry Sansa off to Willas? Unless of course she hadn't yet been planning on poisoning Joffrey and by extension, using Sansa to carry the poison.

If that's the case, then LF was must have been planning on poisoning Joffrey alone since at least ACOK, and we know he wanted the Tyrells involved since he was the one to indirectly inform them of Joffrey's true nature. So did he just leave it up to luck as to whether Olenna works with him to murder Joffrey? We know she probably joined up with him after Tyrion and Sansa were married.

One of the main reasons the Tyrells must have agreed to LF's plan is that with Tyrion's marriage to Sansa, Tywin had control of the North, and by framing Sansa and Tyrion, they'd eliminate that possibility. 

But let's say the Tyrells never offered to marry Sansa to Willas. What then? The reason why LF told Tywin of the Tyrell plot was because it interfered with his plans for Sansa. But telling Tywin of this plot indirectly helped him by pushing the Tyrells to agree to go with his plan.

So here's my question. What was LF's plan had Tyrion not been married to Sansa? Would he still have expected the Tyrells to approach him for help? And if Tyrion wasn't married to Sansa, (eliminating their motif to have him be their fall guy) who would they have blamed?

Perhaps Oberyn? He is known for his hatred of Tywin and his use of poison. And they Tyrells dislike the Dornish, which makes him a perfect candidate. But then, did LF even know Oberyn would be coming to the wedding?

Or would their fall guy had been Sansa alone? As long as she's executed, there's no threat of the Lannisters using her to control the North.",asoiaf,(Spoilers ASOS) A question about a certain plot in the third book

I also know about the fact that he’s probably in Skagos and Sor Davos is going to search for him. By now, the boy is probably wilder than the wildlings. And I also know about Shaggydog’s name can mean his story is going nowhere.

ASOS: + 2 new POVs 

AFFC/ADWD: + 12 (!) new POVs

Had I been GRRM's editor, well, first of all I would've told him to forget this nonsense about splitting the book in two, write AFFC and ADWD as a single novel, trim the fat, and make the following changes regarding the POVs: 

* Asha is the only POV in the Iron Islands, we see the Kingsmoot and everything else from her perspective. 

* Leave Victarion's and Aeron's POVs for TWOW. Vic's clearly got a part to play in the Battle of Fire, but in the meantime his POV is not terribly necessary. We know he's en route to Meereen, we don't need to see his journey there in detail. His first chapter in TWOW could get us up to speed by showing us Moqorro's arrival in a flashback, easy enough. Ditto for Aeron. His first POV ever could easily be the Forsaken and nothing of value would be lost. 

* Similarly, Arianne would be the only POV in Dorne in AFFC/ADWD. Arys' chapter is told from her perspective, as are Hotah's. Arys doesn't get a POV, and Hotah only gets one until TWOW, which is when his story is seemingly going to kick off (I'm noticing a pattern of GRRM giving characters a POV *before* they do anything of importance). 

* Perhaps more controversially, Jon Connington doesn't get a POV until TWOW. We'd be missing his two chapters from ADWD, but are they 100% necessary? Say, what if the last we saw of Team Griff was right before Tyrion got kidnapped by Jorah. We know Tyrion's already planted the seed to invade Westeros sans Dany in Aegon's brain. Then we'd hear from Tyrion's POV that Aegon took the bait and the Golden Company is indeed moving West, and then in the epilogue we'd hear that they landed in the Stormlands. I think it works okay. Everything about Connington's backstory and the grayscale reveal would be left for TWOW, and I think structurally it might work better that way. 

* Melisandre's chapter also gets left for TWOW. I always thought it was a bit weird how that single chapter was just thrown in the middle of everything, felt a bit random. And with Jon ""dead"" or whatever, I assume we're going to see more of Mel's chapters since she's the only POV in the Wall now. 

* Barristan gives me pause. I don't like how his POV just appears during the final third of the book as soon as Dany leaves Meereen. A solution could be to just leave Barry's POV for TWOW and we'd see the beginnings of the coming battle via Tyrion on the slavers' side. But I think, ideally, I would've trimmed the hell out of Dany's ADWD chapters (there's a LOT of fat to cut there, those chapters are seriously repetitive and they rehash the same narrative beats over and over), and so I'd have her leave Meereen sooner. 

* Also, Quentin's POV gets cut. His meeting with Dany we see from her POV, the rest from Barristan's.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Cutting the POV bloat in AFFC/ADWD
1557,"I think, in the show, Bran should have been taught all the magic of the old gods, including the hammer of water. Bran could have used that against Night king by flooding the neck again. But there would be one problem. It took multiple greenseerers to break the arm of Dorne and Bran wouldn't have been powerful enough to carry out the ritual all by himself. In addition to that the ritual would require a sacrifice. I think Rickon would be the appropriate character for the sacrifice(He would survive the longer than the Battle of Bastards). It would thrust a very hard choice upon Jon, Sansa, Arya and Bran.  Jon obviously wouldn't allow it and Bran wouldn't suggest it as something they have to do but as an option they have. 

But re-flooding the neck would do little to defeat the night king. Of course, Night King wouldn't be able to invade the rest of Westeros. Men would be safe from him in the south. But what then? The northerners would never let the white walkers linger in their homeland while they are forced to stay in the south. And if Jon doesn't plan to retreat but fight and kill the night king in winterfell itself like in the show, then there is no point using the spell all.  

So, He could use the spell to cut off king's landing by flooding the land between Godseye and the Trident river. If that happens, then the crownlands would turn into a large island(in the south, blackwater rush flows right at the back of king's landing)

Map of Westeros to see what I'm talking about  :-  [https://quartermaester.info/](https://quartermaester.info/) 

That would Prevent the the white walkers to attack king's landing. Bran would suggest them to retreat from winterfell to the vale. In the vale, the living would ambush the dead from the mountains. After Vale, they would stop at Riverrun. Night king wouldn't be able to kill any peasant because all those who can't fight in the North, the vale and the riverlands would evacuated to the Three sisters, three islands Between the North and the Vale. To add more dead men to his army the night king would have to go all the way to the Reach. The last battle would be the Battle of Casterly Rock where the night king would finally be defeated. 

This would have fixed the show . Instead of Sansa falling in the hands of Ramsay, Rickon will, but it season 5. Roose Bolton would keep him as a hostage to keep the northern lords from rebelling and Ramsay would torture Rickon. That would prompt Theon to help Rickon escape and take him to castle black. meanwhile Sansa would become a player of game of thrones at Vale while staying with Littlefinger.  The long night could have taken an entire season instead of just three episodes. 

This, in my view,  is a lot better than the show. Bran could have been able to use what he had learned from bloodraven. Rickon's death would have had a bigger impact on the story.

Peter Dinklage as Tyrion, Conleth Hill as Varys and Lena Headey as Cersei are other popular candidates.

Thinking simply, their legal father had the throne and when the king dies throne passes to his first born son which is Joffrey and when he dies without a legal heir, the throne passes to his brother. Main catch and kinda the starting point of the War of the five kings is the illegitimacy of the children. 
2. Stannis of House Baratheon of Dragonstone is the older brother and is by law the successor of Robert I since he claims he has no True-born child.
3. Aegon VI Targaryen; If it he is really the son of Rhaegar Targ. he has a good claim for the usurped throne of his father.
5. Daenerys Targaryen, if Aegon is not the son of Rhaegar, she has the best claim to overthrow the usurpers sons from his brothers usurped Throne but she is a woman and woman can't be rulers in the seven kingdoms (except in Dorne).
Renly Baratheon of Highgarden; Bro this guy has no claim to the Throne whatsoever.

1596,"It would have been really cool to see the adventures of the BwB in the epilogue of ACOK, with Berric Dondarion vs the Mountain, only to be killed. I think it could serve a lot of purposes in the story.

- for chronological readers it's a cool way to show how powerful the mountain is, especially as we've upto this point not really seen him in action. It's also a neat way to subvert expectations in Storm because we think we've seen the lighting Lord die only for him to come back.

- I think it would be really cool to see the chapter from the POV of Ned Dayne, as he's his squire and is (or was pre scrapped timeskip) important to the story. He's young enough to not be story breaking, but important enough to give us some nice hints towards whatever went down at the tower of joy.",asoiaf,(spoilers main) an idea for a cool epilogue to Clash

1602,"During Robert's Rebellion, Roose Bolton should have betrayed Ned and attempt to subvert his rule, in a similar fashion to Robb.  

Ned's such a better candidate for it:  The odds were in the Targaryen's favor; Ned wasn't meant to be the head of the Starks, so he wouldn't have gotten the same leadership training as Brandon; and The Starks' position was probably the weakest it had been in a long time.  

Had he worked out how to betray the Starks, the Rebellion would have gone a different way and Aerys would have certainly awarded him with being Warden of the North.  

The obvious meta-reason why he didn't was because the Boltons weren't more than a name at that point, but still, the guy that we know in the series proper would have betrayed the Starks and pressed his position.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) Roose Bolton's Missing Beytrayal

On the other, he would’ve been heavily pressured to support his heir by Cersei and Westerosi norms. Joffrey would no doubt have maintained his innocence, but with both Sansa and Arya repeating the same facts, it would’ve been harder for Robert to shrug it off. You also have to wonder how Ned would react to finding out that Joffrey called Arya a cunt and swung at her with an edged blade.

And the last 2 seasons (Specially Season 7) are filled with these brief scenes. But Who taught Sansa how to Rule or Care for these little things? I don’t believe that Ned &amp; Catelyn Were since in the Second Seasons she was still Naive and she didn’t seem to care about the Servants and all those people. Then Cersei and Littlefinger taught her How to play the game, But not to care about those things (Maybe Littlefinger Offscreen, But in the show she speant so little time in the Vale that she couldn’t have learned to the Extent to be a better ruler than Robb [Or that’s what the Show would make us believe]) Then there’s Jon but if Jon would have been the one who teach her, they wouldn’t disagree in almost everything.

She knows now she can't trust anyone. Olenna is as intimidating as Tywin, Margaery always seems too nice to be well-intentioned, her ideal vision of Loras isn't exactly as she'd hoped, every time Butterbumps does anything I think it ramps up the uneasiness for me, and the rest of the Tyrell family and entourage all seem to have their role to play like well-trained pigeons. They broke Sansa in the softest interrogation ever, but before knowing how the Tyrell's were going to use their chess pieces, I really thought Sansa might be getting herself into something that was somehow worse than her situation with the Lannisters.

Isn't it crazy that the war of the five kings was only the first third of the trilogy? Then Dany's invasion was the second part. Then the Others in the third part.

So then if it translates to the current series, we're about a third of the way through his original plan? So we need another ten books? What is this madness?",asoiaf,GRRM's original trilogy (Spoilers Main)
1617,"It's ironic, in a twisted sort of way, that Joffrey Baratheon grew up without a father despite living in a castle with two of them. Robert was a drunkard who treated his family obligations with much the same indifference as he did the political responsibilities of being king, so it's not surprising that he couldn't be a father figure to his son. But why didn't Jaime step up to fill that role? It's not like he didn't know that Joffrey was his son and his position as a member of the Kingsguard, in addition to being the Queen's sister, would have given him ample access to the young prince. And it's not an issue of secrecy either, because surely no one would bat an eye at an uncle caring for his nephew.

It's just an inescapable fact that Jaime was a really shitty father, not only to Joffrey but to Myrcella and Tommen too. One of my favourite changes from the book to the show was the presence of Jaime at the Purple Wedding (for reasons I'l explain soon, my opinion on that has changed). I haven't read the books in a really long time, but to the best of my recollection Jaime was still on the road with Brienne at the time the PW took place. But in the show, the second Joffrey hits the floor Jaime comes barreling over full sprint to rescue him. He can't, of course, but it's the thought that counts. In an eerily similar scene the following season, which also did not occur in the books, Myrcella collapses in Jaime's arms after being poisoned and dies. On both occasions, Jaime was present to witness their deaths, yet absolutely powerless to save his children. 

Things are a bit different in the books. Myrcella's fate at the end of Book 5 is ambiguous, to say the least, but if she hasn't died yet then she almost certainly will in TWOW. Tommen is definitely alive, but if the finale of Season 6 is any indication then he too isn't long for this world. So that means Joffrey is currently the only child of Jaime's to have definitively, for sure died in the books. But there is a common thread that emerges with Joffrey's death and Myrcella's death* which may be intentional on GRRM's part: Jaime's absence. His children die, and he's never there for them. 

This paints a damning image of Jaime not only as a bad father, but as a bad person. At the beginning of the series, the reader has very little to judge him on other than incest and regicide. And it doesn't help that we mostly see Jaime from the POV of Ned Stark who bears an especially low opinion of him. Part of that is simply that the two could not be more different: Ned Stark is honourable to a fault, Jaime Lannister stabbed his king in the back. The full context of Aerys' death isn't given to the reader until later, so we naturally judge him the only way we can: kingslayer, a man without honour, oathbreaker.

Oathkeeper. That's what he names his sword in ASOS. The significance of that name didn't strike me on my first reading, but it represents a real stark change in his character from how we see him at first (traitor, murderer, liar) to someone who keeps their word. Lannisters, as we well know, always pay their debts. But there's another meaning to the sword that's much more fraught. He gives Oathkeeper to Brienne as she sets off to save Sansa, but her story soon puts her on a collision course with Lady Stoneheart who she once swore her service to in ACOK. Brienne becomes mired in a web of conflicting, un-keepable oaths that problematize the very idea of honour. Or at least, honour as it was understood by Ned Stark. This might be a controversial perspective, but what I have taken from the books is that Ned Stark was very, very wrong about many, many things. ""He who passes the sentence should swing the sword"" may sound noble, but is it realistic? And is it even right? Keep in mind: the execution at the very beginning of AGOT is not told through Ned's perspective, rather we see it through the eyes of Bran. John tells him not to look away because ""father will know if you do."" I always felt uneasy about that chapter, though I wrote it off as medieval morals being different than our own. But because we've seen an adaptation of the series final ending (however bad it was) we know that Bran becomes king. And in retrospect, we would be remiss not to consider the implications of that scene on the rest of the series. There's a clear contrast drawn between Ned's system of justice (right and wrong, black and white) and Bran's childlike, innocent perspective of the world. 

That's why the entire point of Jaime's death is one final, tragic example of how Ned Stark was wrong. I remember being so angry when I first saw S7E5 The Bells because Jaime deserved so much better. More than that, I refused to believe he would just walk away from 8 seasons worth of character growth. But here's the thing: he didn't, and neither did GRRM. Jaime was an oathbreaker who became an oathkeeper, a father who resolved to do for his unborn child what he failed to do for Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. In the final moments of the series, Brienne writes in the Kingsguard book that Jaime ""died protecting his queen."" He kept his promise to Cersei, as Ned did to Lyanna. His death is meant to feel unjust to the audience because we, like Bran, know that he didn't deserve to die for his mistakes. That's why he spares Tyrion, so he can ""spend the rest of his life making up for them."" 

Ultimately, I believe ASOIAF is largely a repudiation of Ned Stark's warped notion of justice and we the reader are shown demonstrably, time and time again, that people have the capacity to change. Those who were once traitors and murderers can be better people than they were before. Jaime becomes the man Ned Stark never believed he could be, and in subscribing to that ideal of justice he felt the full weight of his mistakes brought down upon him. [He paid his debts.](https://i.imgur.com/EbYPV8I.jpg)",asoiaf,[Spoilers Main] Jaime becomes the man Ned Stark never believed he could be. And that's why he needed to face the music in The Bells.
1618,"I think it'd be better because if he set up a website or something where he could post all his TWOW progress then it would dispel the rumours that he hasn't written anything or that he's written it all or just waiting for something. Also it would make the long waits understandable if he says for example 'this chapter is quite hard to write' or 'I need to do a couple rewrites' so then we get full clarification on why TWOW is taking so long. Also, we could be able to make good predictions ourselves of when TWOW is coming out based on how much he's written instead of the sometimes quite cryptic blog posts GRRM puts out there. Overall, it would be a constant reminder of progress for everyone, make people more sympathetic towards what he's doing and make it so we could probably make accurate predictions for when TWOW is coming out.

1622,"Since the Age of Heroes, the Wildlings have repeatedly tried to invade the Seven Kingdoms for different reasons:

&gt;Raymun Redbeard, Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, the Horned Lord, they all came south to conquer, but I've come with my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall.""

**I thought it would be interesting to list out the different invasions and discuss.**

***

Some maesterly wording:

&gt;The threat posed to the realm by these savage peoples can safely be discounted, save for the times, once in a great while, when they united beneath the leadership of a king-beyond-the- Wall. Though many wildling raiders and war chiefs have aspired to this title, few have ever achieved it. None of the wildlings who have risen up to become King-Beyond-the-Wall have done aught to build a true kingdom or care for their people; in truth, such men are warlords, not monarchs, and though elsewise much different one from the other, each has led his peoples against the Wall, in hopes of breaching it and conquering the Seven Kingdoms to the south.

#Timeline

It should be noted that dating fake ancient history is a rough estimate at best. The in world maesters confirm this.

There have been up to 6 possible attempts at Kings-Beyond-the Wall invading the Seven Kingdoms:

**Joramun** - ""ancient days"", lots of myth and legend involved in the story

**Gendel and Gorne** - 3,000 years ago (so occurred ~2700 BC)

**The Horned Lord** - 1 or 2 Thousand years after Gendel/Gorne (anywhere from ~1700 BC to ~ 700 BC)

**Bael the Bard** - The hardest one to nail down from a timeline perspective, especially due to the conflicting evidence, but it should be noted that even in the wildling story the Starks are called Lords and not Kings and it took place ""centuries"" after the Horned Lord

**Raymun Redbeard** - 226 AC (about 75 years before current events)

**Mance Rayder** - 300 AC

#The Invasions

**Joramun**

If this happened at all, it most likely happened in the Age of Heroes when [legendary characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/hx2s1s/each_region_of_westeros_most_legendary_character/) were walking around Westeros:

&gt;The first King-Beyond-the-Wall, according to legend, was Joramun, who claimed to have a horn that would bring down the Wall when it woke ""the giants from the earth."" (That the Wall still stands says something of his claim, and perhaps even of his existence.) -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Wildlings

Was involved in the defeat of the Night's King:

&gt;He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. **For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage.** After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden. -ASOS, Bran IV

and:

&gt;The oldest of these tales concern the legendary Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who was alleged to have bedded a sorceress pale as a corpse and declared himself a king. For thirteen years the Night's King and his ""corpse queen"" ruled together, **before King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker, (in alliance, it is said, with the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun) brought them down.** Thereafter, he obliterated the Night's King's very name from memory. -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Night's Watch

Horn-Blower is one of Tormund's [many nicknames](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/emwkgp/tormunds_nicknames_spoilers_extended/)

&gt;""So how did you come by your other names?"" Jon asked. ""Mance called you the Horn-Blower, didn't he? Mead-king of Ruddy Hall, Husband to Bears, Father to Hosts?"" **It was the horn blowing he particularly wanted to hear about, but he dared not ask too plainly. And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter, and woke giants from the earth. Is that where they had come from, them and their mammoths? Had Mance Rayder found the Horn of Joramun, and given it to Tormund Thunderfist to blow?** - ASOS, Jon II

Whether they found the actual horn is still debated:

&gt;""Not for fear!"" She kicked savagely at the ice beneath her with a heel, chopping out a chunk. **""I'm crying because we never found the Horn of Winter. We opened half a hundred graves and let all those shades loose in the world, and never found the Horn of Joramun to bring this cold thing down!**"" -ASOS, Jon IV

and:

&gt;""Yes,"" Mance said. ""The Horn of Winter, that Joramun once blew to wake giants from the earth.""

&gt;**The horn was huge, eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put his arm inside up to the elbow. If this came from an aurochs, it was the biggest that ever lived. At first he thought the bands around it were bronze, but when he moved closer he realized they were gold. Old gold, more brown than yellow, and graven with runes.** -ASOS, Jon X

Mel burn's it:

&gt;Lady Melisandre watched him rise. ""FREE FOLK! Here stands your king of lies. And here is the horn he promised would bring down the Wall."" Two queen's men brought forth the Horn of Joramun, black and banded with old gold, eight feet long from end to end. Runes were carved into the golden bands, the writing of the First Men. Joramun had died thousands of years ago, but Mance had found his grave beneath a glacier, high up in the Frostfangs. And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter, and woke giants from the earth. Ygritte had told Jon that Mance never found the horn. She lied, or else Mance kept it secret even from his own. -ADWD, Jon III

Or did she:

&gt;""Melisandre burned the Horn of Joramun.""

&gt;""Did she?"" Tormund slapped his thigh and hooted. ""She burned that fine big horn, aye. A bloody sin, I call it. A thousand years old, that was. We found it in a giant's grave, and no man o' us had ever seen a horn so big. That must have been why Mance got the notion to tell you it were Joramun's. He wanted you crows to think he had it in his power to blow your bloody Wall down about your knees. But we never found the true horn, not for all our digging. If we had, every kneeler in your Seven Kingdoms would have chunks o' ice to cool his wine all summer.""

&gt;Jon turned in his saddle, frowning. And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth. That huge horn with its bands of old gold, incised with ancient runes … had Mance Rayder lied to him, or was Tormund lying now? **If Mance's horn was just a feint, where is the true horn?** -ADWD, Jon XII

It also should be noted that we have a couple other horns that do very similar things to ""**waking giants from the earth"":**

&gt;Claw Isle was but lightly garrisoned, its castle reputedly stuffed with Myrish carpets, Volantene glass, gold and silver plate, jeweled cups, magnificent hawks, an axe of Valyrian steel, a horn that could **summon monsters from the deep**, chests of rubies, and more wines than a man could drink in a hundred years. 

and:

&gt;That horn you heard I found amongst the smoking ruins that were Valyria, where no man has dared to walk but me. You heard its call, and felt its power. It is a dragon horn, bound with bands of red gold and Valyrian steel graven with enchantments. The dragonlords of old sounded such horns, before the Doom devoured them. With this horn, ironmen, I can **bind dragons to my will**. -AFFC, The Drowned Man

***

**Gendel and Gorne**

Gendel and Gorne were brother kings who used caves to go beneath the Wall:

&gt;""... **and the brother kings Gendel and Gorne** ,... Each man of them broke his strength on the Wall, or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side . . . -ASOS, Jon X

The passage is known as [Gorne's Way](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gorne%27s_Way)

&gt;""You know nothing, Jon Snow. It went on and on and on. There are hundreds o' caves in these hills, and down deep they all connect. **There's even a way under your Wall. Gorne's Way.""**

&gt;""Gorne,"" said Jon. ""Gorne was King-beyond-the-Wall.""

&gt;""Aye,"" said Ygritte. **""Together with his brother Gendel, three thousand years ago. They led a host o' free folk through the caves, and the Watch was none the wiser. But when they come out, the wolves o' Winterfell fell upon them.""**

&gt;""There was a battle,"" Jon recalled. ""Gorne slew the King in the North, but his son picked up his banner and took the crown from his head, and cut down Gorne in turn."" -ASOS, Jon III

Gorne was slain but the tales differ about Gendel:

&gt;""And the sound o' swords woke the crows in their castles, and they rode out all in black to take the free folk in the rear.""

&gt;""Yes. Gendel had the king to the south, the Umbers to the east, and the Watch to the north of him. **He died as well.""

&gt;**""You know nothing, Jon Snow. Gendel did not die.** He cut his way free, through the crows, and led his people back north with the wolves howling at their heels. Only Gendel did not know the caves as Gorne had, and took a wrong turn."" She swept the torch back and forth, so the shadows jumped and moved. ""Deeper he went, and deeper, and when he tried t' turn back the ways that seemed familiar ended in stone rather than sky. Soon his torches began t' fail, one by one, till finally there was naught but dark. Gendel's folk were never seen again, but on a still night you can hear their children's children's children sobbing under the hills, still looking for the way back up. Listen? Do you hear them?"" -ASOS, Jon III

Some supposed history on how Gendel/Gorne got the cave:

&gt;It has long been held that they did this for protection from predators such as direwolves or shadowcats, which their simple stone weapons—and even their vaunted greenseers—were not proof against. But other sources dispute this, stating that their greatest foes were the giants, as hinted at in tales told in the North, and **as possibly proved by Maester Kennet in the study of a barrow near the Long Lake (same place Raymun Redbeard was defeated)—a giant's burial with obsidian arrowheads found amidst the extant ribs. It brings to mind a transcription of a wildling song in Maester Herryk's History of the Kings-Beyond-the-Wall, regarding the brothers Gendel and Gorne. They were called upon to mediate a dispute between a clan of children and a family of giants over the possession of a cavern. Gendel and Gorne, it is said, ultimately resolved the matter through trickery, making both sides disavow any desire for the cavern, after the brothers discovered it was a part of a greater chain of caverns that eventually passed beneath the Wall.** But considering that the wildlings have no letters, their traditions must be looked at with a jaundiced eye. -TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Dawn Age

**The Horned Lord**

This is my favorite, He used sorcery to pass the Wall:

&gt;**The Horned Lord would follow them, a thousand years after (or perhaps two). His name is lost to history, but he was said to have used sorcery to pass the Wall.**  -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Wildlings

&gt;""We free folk know things you kneelers have forgotten. Sometimes the short road is not the safest, Jon Snow. **The Horned Lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt. There is no safe way to grasp it.**"" -ASOS, Jon X

Since we know that the Horned Lord was able to ""pass the wall through sorcery"" (only guess is black gate?) and was defeated at some point, I think we can assume (from the Dalla quote) that since ""all magic has a cost"" is one of the major themes of the series, that some magic/sorcery could have been involved in his defeat. Seeing that the Starks have warg powers its possible that that was his demise.

Lastly its possible the Horned Lord is a mention of skinchanging itself kind of like Warg King. 

Maybe relevant:

&gt;The ""unicorns"" of Skagos were once scoffed at by maesters at the Citadel. The occasional ""unicorn horn"" offered by disreputable merchants has never been more than the horn of a kind of whale hunted by the whalers of Ib. However, horns of quite a different kind—reputed to be from Skagos—have been seen by the maesters at Eastwatch upon occasion. It is also said that those seafarers brave enough to trade on Skagos have glimpsed the stoneborn lords riding great, shaggy, horned beasts, monstrous mounts so sure-footed they have been known to climb the sides of mountains. A living example of such a creature—or even a skeleton—has long been sought for study, but none has ever been brought to Oldtown.

**Bael the Bard**

Bael the Bard story inspired Mance's exploits as Abel. It also should be noted the imagery between Lyanna/Jon/Winter Roses as we see in Dany's vision and Ned's dream. Bael's exploits are less of an ""invasion"" than the rest of them.

The Tale (short version):

&gt;After him, centuries later, came Bael the Bard, whose songs are still sung beyond the Wall...but there are questions as to whether he truly existed or not. The wildlings say he did and credit many songs to his name, but the old chronicles of Winterfell say nothing of him. Whether this was due to the defeats and humiliations he was said to have visited upon them (including, according to one improbable story, deflowering a Stark maid and getting her with child) or because he never existed, we cannot truly say. -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Wildlings

Long version:

&gt;She smiled again, a flash of white teeth. ""And she never sung you the song o' the winter rose?""

&gt;""I never knew my mother. Or any such song.""

&gt;**""Bael the Bard made it,"" said Ygritte. ""He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back. All the free folk know his songs, but might be you don't sing them in the south.""** 

&gt;""I'll hear it all the same.""

&gt;""Brave black crow,"" she mocked. ""Well, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael was a great raider.""

&gt;Stonesnake gave a snort. ""A murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.""

&gt;""That's all in where you're standing too,"" Ygritte said. ""The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael's head, but never could take him, and the taste o' failure galled him. One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak. When word o' that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson. So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter's night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos. Sygerrik means 'deceiver' in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.""

&gt;""North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark's own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he played, and new ones he'd made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward. 'All I ask is a flower,' Bael answered, 'the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o' Winterfell.'""

&gt;""Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o' the winter roses be plucked for the singer's payment. And so it was done. But when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon's maiden daughter. Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.""

&gt;Jon had never heard this tale before. ""Which Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael. There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but—""

&gt;""This was Brandon the Daughterless,"" Ygritte said sharply. ""Would you hear the tale, or no?""

&gt;He scowled. ""Go on.""

&gt;""Lord Brandon had no other children. At his behest, the black crows flew forth from their castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could they find any sign o' Bael or this maid. For most a year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to his bed, and it seemed as though the line o' Starks was at its end. But one night as he lay waiting to die, Lord Brandon heard a child's cry. He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a babe at her breast.""

&gt;""Bael had brought her back?""

&gt;""No. They had been in Winterfell all the time, hiding with the dead beneath the castle. The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son, the song says . . . though if truth be told, all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote. Be that as it may, what's certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose he'd plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark. So there it is—you have Bael's blood in you, same as me.""

&gt;""It never happened,"" Jon said.

&gt;She shrugged. ""Might be it did, might be it didn't. It is a good song, though. My mother used to sing it to me. She was a woman too, Jon Snow. Like yours."" She rubbed her throat where his dirk had cut her. ""The song ends when they find the babe, but there is a darker end to the story. Thirty years later, when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south, it was young Lord Stark who met him at the Frozen Ford . . . and killed him, for Bael would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword.""

&gt;""So the son slew the father instead,"" said Jon.

&gt;""Aye,"" she said, ""but the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing. When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael's head upon his spear, she threw herself from a tower in her grief. Her son did not long outlive her. One o' his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak.""

&gt;""Your Bael was a liar,"" he told her, certain now.

&gt;""No,"" Ygritte said, ""but a bard's truth is different than yours or mine. Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told it."" She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep. -ACOK, Jon VI

Mance's thoughts:

&gt;""Would that I were. I will not deny that Bael's exploit inspired mine own . . . but I did not steal either of your sisters that I recall. Bael wrote his own songs, and lived them. I only sing the songs that better men have made. More mead?"" -ASOS, Jon I

and Theon's thoughts on Mance:

&gt;Every word she said persuaded Theon that this was all some ploy. But whose, and to what end? What could Abel want of him? The man was just a singer, a pander with a lute and a false smile. He wants to know how I took the castle, but not to make a song of it. The answer came to him. He wants to know how we got in so he can get out. Lord Bolton had Winterfell sewn up tight as a babe's swaddling clothes. No one could come or go without his leave. He wants to flee, him and his washerwoman. Theon could not blame him, but even so he said, ""I want no part of Abel, or you, or any of your sisters. Just leave me be."" -ADWD, A Ghost in Winterfell

***

**Raymun Redbeard**

Raymun Redbeard invaded during the time of [William Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Willam_Stark) who was slain:

&gt;""Wildlings have invaded the realm before."" Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and Maester Luwin both, back at Winterfell. **""Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather's grandfather,""

&gt;... Each man of them broke his strength on the Wall, or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side . . . -ACOK, Jon III

The story of Raymun's invasion:

&gt;If the climbers reached the top of the Wall undetected, however, everything changed. **Given time, they could carve out a toehold for themselves up there, throwing up ramparts of their own and dropping ropes and ladders for thousands more to clamber over after them. That was how Raymun Redbeard had done it, Raymun who had been King-Beyond-the-Wall in the days of his grandfather's grandfather. Jack Musgood had been the lord commander in those days. Jolly Jack, he was called before Redbeard came down upon the north; Sleepy Jack, forever after. Raymun's host had met a bloody end on the shores of Long Lake, caught between Lord Willam of Winterfell and the Drunken Giant, Harmond Umber. Redbeard had been slain by Artos the Implacable, Lord Willam's younger brother. The Watch arrived too late to fight the wildlings, but in time to bury them, the task that Artos Stark assigned them in his wroth as he grieved above the headless corpse of his fallen brother.** -ADWD, Jon II

and:

&gt;The last King-Beyond-the-Wall to cross the Wall was Raymun Redbeard, who brought the wildlings together in 212 or 213 AC. It was not until 226 AC that he and the wildlings would breach the Wall by climbing in their hundreds and thousands up the slick ice and down the other side.

&gt;Raymun's host numbered in the thousands, by all accounts, and they fought their way as far south as Long Lake. There, Lord Willam Stark and the Drunken Giant, Lord Harmond of House Umber, brought their armies against them. With two hosts surrounding him, and the lake to his back, Redbeard fought and died, but not before slaying Lord Willam. 

&gt;When the Night's Watch appeared at last, led by its Lord Commander Jack Musgood (called Jolly Jack Musgood before the invasion, and Sleepy Jack Musgood forever after), the battle was done and the angry Artos Stark (the late Lord Willam's brother, accounted the most fearsome warrior of his age) gave the black brothers the duty of burying the dead. This task, at the least, they performed admirably. -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Wildlings

Some of his relatives (through his younger brother) still live:

&gt;...**""Him with the red hair, he's Gerrick Kingsblood's get. Comes o' the line o' Raymun Redbeard, to hear him tell it. The line o' Redbeard's little brother, you want it true.""** ... -ADWD, Jon XII

&gt;Amongst the stream of warriors were the fathers of many of Jon's hostages. ... **Red-bearded Gerrick Kingsblood brought three daughters. ""They will make fine wives, and give their husbands strong sons of royal blood,"" he boasted. ""Like their father, they are descended from Raymun Redbeard, who was King-Beyond-the-Wall.""** 

&gt;Blood meant little and less amongst the free folk, Jon knew. Ygritte had taught him that. Gerrick's daughters shared her same flame-red hair, though hers had been a tangle of curls and theirs hung long and straight. Kissed by fire. ""Three princesses, each lovelier than the last,"" he told their father. ""I will see that they are presented to the queen."" Selyse Baratheon would take to these three better than she had to Val, he suspected; they were younger and considerably more cowed. Sweet enough to look at them, though their father seems a fool. -ADWD, Jon XII

&gt;Gerrick Kingsblood was a tall man, long of leg and broad of shoulder. The queen had dressed him in some of the king's old clothes, it appeared. Scrubbed and groomed, clad in green velvets and an ermine half-cape, with his long red hair freshly washed and his fiery beard shaped and trimmed, the wildling looked every inch a southron lord. He could walk into the throne room at King's Landing, and no one would blink an eye, Jon thought.

&gt;""Gerrick is the true and rightful king of the wildlings,"" the queen said, ""descended in an unbroken male line from their great king Raymun Redbeard, whereas the usurper Mance Rayder was born of some common woman and fathered by one of your black brothers.""

&gt;No, Jon might have said, Gerrick is descended from a younger brother of Raymun Redbeard. To the free folk that counted about as much as being descended from Raymun Redbeard's horse. They know nothing, Ygritte. And worse, they will not learn. 

&gt;""Gerrick has graciously agreed to give the hand of his eldest daughter to my beloved Axell, to be united by the Lord of Light in holy wedlock,"" Queen Selyse said. ""His other girls shall wed at the same time—the second daughter with Ser Brus Buckler and the youngest with Ser Malegorn of Redpool.""-ADWD, Jon XIII

Raymun's little brother was called the Red Raven due to being craven, but the only reason that I really even brought him up is because Bloodraven mentions his daughters possibly:

&gt;""He has a little red cock to go with all that red hair, that's what he has. Raymund Redbeard and his sons died at Long Lake, thanks to your bloody Starks and the Drunken Giant. Not the little brother. Ever wonder why they called him the Red Raven?"" Tormund's mouth split in a gap-toothed grin. ""First to fly the battle, he was. 'Twas a song about it, after. The singer had to find a rhyme for craven, so …"" He wiped his nose. ""If your queen's knights want those girls o' his, they're welcome to them.""

&gt;**""Girls,"" squawked Mormont's raven. ""Girls, girls.""** -ADWD, Jon XIII

It should also be noted that many characters we meet in the [She Wolves of Winterfell](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/eqisf1/what_we_know_the_she_wolves_of_winterfell/) will probably be alive/involved in the battle against Raymun:

&gt;**In the decades that followed, the North saw the Starks dealing with the rebellion of Skagos, a renewed onslaught of reaving by the ironborn under Dagon Greyjoy, and a wildling invasion led by Raymun Redbeard, the King-Beyond-the-Wall in 226 AC. In each of these, Starks died.** Yet the house continued with its fortunes mostly unchanged—likely because of the firm resolve of most Lords of Winterfell not to become embroiled in the intrigues of the southron court.  -TWOIAF, The North: The Lords of Winterfell

***

**Mance Rayder**

I don't think I need to say to much about Mance, outside of noting the fact that he is the only king we know of to actually assault the Wall. Which makes sense since the Wall is [pretty hard to storm](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cz99sv/by_siege_or_storm_ii_a_look_at_attacks_on_castles/)

Unlike the other kings who came south to conquer, he is running:

&gt;Raymun Redbeard, Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, the Horned Lord, they all came south to conquer, but I've come with my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall.""

***

There are probably other kings (Mance notes he defeated some) and invasions that havent been mentioned yet, but I tried to list out as much relevant info on each as I could.

1625,"
Just thinking about what everybody thinks the prologues and epilogues of the last two ASOIAF books are. We’ve largely established that the TWOW prologue will be a BwB/Lady Stoneheart attack on Forley Prester’s column.

I think a good possibility for the epilogue (assuming it isn’t a POV character) could be Gilly. Euron sacks Oldtown, levels the Hightower/is bodied by Leyton Hightower (we’ll see) and Sam and Gilly flee? Through a book (or Jaqen H’ghar) they find out about R+L=J, and are sent to the Wall, possibly to try and tell Jon of his heritage, unaware that Jon died, or that the Wall fell.

ADOS prologue - Varys. fAegon is crowned, when one of his spies tell him that Daenerys Targaryen and her fleet have sailed from Slaver’s Bay. Another possibility would be Loras Tyrell (!) who is recovering on Dragonstone from his wounds, now knowing the Tyrells are dead and he is Lord of Highgarden, his seat on the Kingsguard void, Hating fAegon for taking KL, he bows to Daenerys Targaryen when she arrives, maybe hoping to race to KL to save a Tyrell (?) or try to consolidate his power in the Reach, and defeat Jon Connington’s friend in the Reach.

1628," GRRM said himself that he didn't like it when Tolkien resurrected Gandalf, so it's a bit contradictory when he basically does the same with Jon, especially when the whole series is about actions having deadly consequences and such. Yes I know Catelyn got resurrected in the form of Lady Stoneheart, but I support that because that was only once, it was unexpected, chilling, and made it so Catelyn is basically unrecognisable to Stoneheart so that Stoneheart is basically a different character now. GRRM could do something similar with Jon, but I feel like once you've done it twice, you've sorta broken your own rule, whereas the once is groundbreaking. Also if they did it the way they did it in the show that's definitely breaking GRRM's 'rules'.

1635,"As far as I'm aware there isn't any real precedent for two on one or three on one dragon combat in ASOIAF. However, most 1v1 combats are strongly dependent on size, with the larger dragon usually easily destroying the smaller one, with the exception of Caraxes vs Vhagar.

Daenerys has three fairly small dragons, a number that could easily drop to two. They probably have 2-3 more years to grow before any kind of climactic battle, so they might get maybe 2-3x bigger than they are currently. But there are several potential much larger dragons, probably controlled by the Others or Euron, they might have to fight if there is a climactic battle. Some of these could be larger than Balerion the Black Dread: ice dragons, sea dragons, and the dragon that may have attacked Balerion in Valyria.

Could 2 or 3 of Daenerys's dragons, at their ADOS maturity level, defeat a Balerion+ sized dragon in aerial combat? On the one hand, any of them taking any kind of hit would probably be immediately fatal. But on the other, handling enemies attacking from multiple directions is always difficult, particularly in aerial combat where they can maneuver in three directions. And removing the rider without killing the actual dragon could be adequate to achieve victory.

As a bonus round: Daenerys's three dragons vs one kaiju sized three-headed dragon. Here I think the ability to cover multiple attack directions would leave them fairly outmatched.

The child/teen characters (Jon, Dany, Sansa) seem to have the instincts and maturity of adults.

1653,"Hey guys,

I've just finished ASOIAF and am joining the community in this unbearable wait for TWOW (how do you do it?!)

Anyway, since I finished, I've been building various theories and ideas in my head, and this is the one I'm most excited about.

I only just joined Reddit, mainly to share this theory, and am something of a novice with all this, so apologies if this theory has been shared before and/or makes little sense...
___________________________________________________

The theory 

Bran the Builder wielded Ice, the original version of the Stark sword. When it proved ineffective against the others, he reforged it with Dragonglass. He then stabbed his loved one, a woman from House Dayne, with it to give it its power. 

After he and the Night's Watch prevailed against the Others and brought an end to the Long Night, the sword was given to House Dayne in honour of the woman's sacrifice, and they renamed it Dawn, as it was the sword that brought the dawn. 

Bran the Builder forged another house sword, also called Ice, and built the wall and Winterfell. 
___________________________________________________

Why it works

The legend goes that Dawn was forged from the heart of a fallen star. This ""star"" could be the Dayne woman, as the sword's power was born in her, and Dayne's can be referred to as stars like Starks are called wolves. 

Dawn is often described as being made from something that looks and acts differently to any metal such as steel or iron.

We know that the sword we see wielded by Ned Stark is not the original Ice but the second one.

The Night's Watch vows have heavy connotations about Lightbringer, which suggests they were there when it was used.  

We know that they fought in the final battle of the Long Night, and we also know that Bran the Builder built their wall and gave them lands. This could be because they fought alongside each other. 
___________________________________________________

What it means 

If true, it would surely mean the Dayne's have a large role to play in the final two books and the war against the others.

Specifically, the one who is doomed worthy of wielding Dawn (Lightbringer). No currently known Dayne has been given the honour, so it would have to be a new/hidden one.

With Jon Snow most likely being a Targ (R+L=J), the obvious character to fit this role would be Aegon/Young Griff/fAegon.

It's known that Dayne and Targ looks are often similar, and I'm sure you'll all heard the Septa Lemore = Ashara Dayne theory. If not, go check it out.

The theory would also of course make Azor Ahai/The Last Hero a Stark, which could have some connotations for Jon and/or Bran. I'm not sure what specifically, so let me know your thoughts.
___________________________________________________

Like I said, this is indeed my first rodeo, and I'm sure this theory has been shared before in much more detail. I just got carried away thinking of it myself and wanted to share it with you guys!

I like to imagine Theon having balls and Asha laying a good plan so they could conquer half of the Westerlands and throw Balon down the well. Well, any well.

1668," 

Fans theorize that the horn of winter causes an earthquake. The earthquake caused holes in the ground which woke the giants from the earth. This theory makes the most sense and explains that if the horn had the power to destroy the wall, why is it still standing?

Some claim that the horn was created by the wildlings with the help of children of the forests. But if the children want the wall standing why would contribute in creating such a thing?

My theory is that the wildlings created the horn, Joramun himself to be specific, using the magic of the old gods. The history of Westeros starts with the dawn age. Then comes the arrival of the first men. A war broke out between COF and FM. The war ended with the pact. The pact marked the beginning of the age of heroes. This means that through out the age of heroes there was peace among COF and FM and the age of heroes lasted thousands of years. During that time, FM started worshipping the old gods. After some centuries of peace, COF might taught the first men the magic of the old gods. It is said that one is a thousand men would be born as wargs and one in ten thousands would be born as a Greenseer. So maybe COF taught those greenseer the magic of the old gods just like they are doing with Bran. Magic may have taught to the future generations by the FM.

When the wall was raised and some FM were trapped north of the wall. Maybe Joramun had been taught the magic as well. So he created the Horn that could summon earthquakes. With such power he gathered the free folk and crowned himself king\_beyond-the-wall. He threatened to blow the horn if not allowed to go north of the wall. He wouldn't use it because he knew the realm would basically be defenseless if the wall fell. That's what Mance rayder did. He just threatened to blow it if he wasn't allowed south.

Joramun soon teamed up with the King of winter, Brandon the Breaker, to defeat the night's king. Joramun learned that the white walkers went so far as to seduce the lord commander of the night's watch and get him give his soul and offer his own brothers to the very creatures he swore fight, he realized that the power to bring down the wall shouldn't exist at all so he surrendered his horn to Brandon the Breaker who broke the Horn's magic and the black gate. The black is a scret entrancce into the night fort. Maybe, Night's king built that to avoid the magic of the COF and bring his Other wife into the night fort. Black gate' smagic was broken too. That's why is known as Brandon Stark is known as Brandon the Breaker. Becasue he broke the magic in the horn and the black gate.

The horn Sam has in the books maybe the broken horn and would require magic to be used again. Or that horn is just some random horn.

1671,"Imagine this. You are watching the end of The Empire strikes Back. Luke Skywalker is currently doing his best to save the galaxy. But then, out of the blue Ezra Bridger, a more trained and powerful Jedi arrives! That’s how I see fAegon
  
The Last of The Targaryens is a title that moves Dany’s actions more than anything. Now this is weakened by Aegon. I feel as though he is only there to serve as a weak plot point to push Daenerys’ character forward. He suddenly enters the series, when we already have all the major characters in place, thus ruining the carefully established balance between all sides of the conflict. He’s there because someone needs to take King’s Landing and Meereen is to messy. 
 The most bizarre thing about him is Varys’ support. Dany has proven herself a competent ruler. fAegon lives on a boat. Why would Varys support him???
 Even if he is fake - what is the point? To make Dany hate Westeros????? To turn her insane???! To make dragons fight??? I do not understand the logic of this decision. 
Overall in my opinion fAegon is an unnecessary twist serving no real purpose. I hope he’ll redeem himself by having an actual role in the wars to come and by being an actual character. I would much prefer Dany just left Meereen instead of this fuckery.",asoiaf,(Spoilers extended) I hate fAegon

Hypothetically, if Stannis manages to win the IT by right of conquest and then subsequently lose it and get exiled by Dany, Stannis will have as much claim to the throne as Viserys had in the beginning of the series, making the claim of Right of Blood moot as long as they live.

So I ***gathered as much info about the Lady of the Leaves to theorize about**, outside of the very possible answer that she is who she is and she exists for world building and exposition.

***

#ASOS, Arya IV

The Brotherhood take Arya along after capturing her and they look to the Lady of the Leaves for Beric's whereabouts:

&gt;""And a hard man to find, it would seem,"" the maester said. ""**Have you asked the Lady of the Leaves?**""

&gt;""We shall,"" said Greenbeard.

We then get get Anguy being ""secretive/close lipped"":

&gt;""What did the maester mean, about **asking the Lady of the Leaves?**"" Arya asked Anguy as they rode.

&gt;The archer smiled. ""Wait and see.""

We then finally meet her and she lives in this tree town:

&gt;Three days later, as they rode through a yellow wood, Jack-Be-Lucky unslung his horn and blew a signal, a different one than before. The sounds had scarcely died away when rope ladders unrolled from the limbs of trees. ""Hobble the horses and up we go,"" said Tom, half singing the words. **They climbed to a hidden village in the upper branches, a maze of rope walkways and little moss-covered houses concealed behind walls of red and gold**

Her description (the [wiki](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lady_of_the_Leaves) lists her as old, but I don't think this requires her to be ""old""):

,and were taken to the Lady of the Leaves, a stick-thin white-haired woman dressed in roughspun. ""We cannot stay here much longer, with autumn on us,"" she told them. ""A dozen wolves went down the Hayford road nine days past, hunting. If they'd chanced to look up they might have seen us.""

And they discuss Beric/death/etc.:

&gt;""You've not seen Lord Beric?"" asked Tom Sevenstrings.

&gt;""He's dead."" The woman sounded sick. ""The Mountain caught him, and drove a dagger through his eye. A begging brother told us. He had it from the lips of a man who saw it happen.""

&gt;""That's an old stale tale, and false,"" said Lem. ""The lightning lord's not so easy to kill. Ser Gregor might have put his eye out, but a man don't die o' that. Jack could tell you.""

&gt;...

&gt;""You swear he's not dead?"" The woman clutched Lem's arm. ""Bless you, Lem, that's the best tidings we've had in half a year. May the Warrior defend him, and the red priest too.""

**They then depart and move on and the Lady of the Leaves is never mentioned again. They go to her to get info about Beric, and not only does she not give them any, they give her some.**

#Description

- follower of the Seven

- seems to be the leader/Lady of a village in the trees in the Riverlands

- is known to Maester Lychester

- a friend of the Brotherhood

- sounds sick

#Thoughts/Theories

So why does she exist and who might she be?

**House Blackwood**

Numerous members of House Blackwood are described as [thin/gaunt](https://reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gvyy8l/some_more_thoughts_on_coldhands_identity_spoilers/) and while she has white hair, there is no mentioned of her being albino (Arya notices the Ghost of High Heart's albinism). 

If the small chance that she is a member of House Blackwood, I would assume theories for Mya/Gwenys Rivers would probably work best.

***

**Beric/Resurrection reveal**

Its quite possible that GRRM was just trying to build up Beric and his [life status](https://reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ezwc1n/the_seven_deaths_of_the_lightning_lord_spoilers/) ambiguity for the reveal after the Trial by Combat with Sandor Clegane.

Adding a mysterious character (who adds to the robin hood theme of the BWB with the tree towns, etc.) that has ""info"" about him. My small problem with this is that she doesn't actually give them any info about her, they give her info.

***

**Worldbuilding**

As I mentioned, its quite possible that she was included for just building the world in the riverlands and for another small detour in Arya's plotline.

***

**Saving for Later**

She could be a character that GRRM created and decided to put on the shelf for a bit until necessary. This has been seemingly done with some characters we haven't met like [Leyton Hightower](https://reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ewu050/the_man_in_the_high_castle_spoilers_extended/) or ones we have like Rickon Stark.

***

**Gods/Goddesses**

The name Lady of the Leaves automatically brings up connections to the Old Gods/trees/weirwoods, but it also should be noted that she thanks the Warrior for protecting Beric/Thoros.

Unless you want to get tinfoily and think that she is some goddess like the Lady of the Waves to her village tree town.

***

Im sure someone could come up for a theory involving anyone from Joanna Lannister, to Ashara Dayne to Jenny of Oldstones to Shiera Seastar or Alys Rivers but I couldn't really find anything from the limited information that we receive on her appearance.

1675,"I hope most of you have seen Preston jacobs' [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkG0MRfCrC8eFRmuDJyjiFKBdQRNfwrWU) on Alayne I, TWOW where he pointed out so many interesting similarities between The Vale and Ashford tourney. If not, i hope you guys check it out.

Besides those, I noticed some paralleled passages between the two tourneys on Hedge knight reread.

The fascinating thing is, the scenarios almost match word to word and happen in the same sequence that it's pretty much a giveaway that GRRM referred to his Ashford tourney notes while writing Alayne I, TWOW.


Here's Sansa and Dunk watching the respective tourneys being set up on the grounds:


1.  **Whitewashing the barriers and the competitors entryway:**


  *Sansa's POV:*

&gt; **Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.**


    *Dunk's POV:*


&gt; **Lord Ashford’s carpenters were whitewashing the waist- high wooden barriers that would separate the jousters. There were five lanes, arrayed north to south so none of the competitors would ride with the sun in his eyes.**



2.  **Viewing stands for the audience:**


*Sansa's POV:*


&gt; **Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between.** 


 *Dunk's POV:*

&gt; **A three- tiered viewing stand had been raised on the eastern side of the lists, with an orange canopy to shield the lords and ladies from rain and sun**


3. **Participants training with Quitains at the edge of the grounds and our POV characters recognize the competitors involved:**


 *Sansa's POV:*

&gt; **At the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields.. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.**


*Dunk's POV:*

&gt; **On the eastern verge of the meadow, a quintain had been set up and a dozen knights were tilting at it, sending the pole arm spinning every time they struck the splintered shield suspended from one end. Dunk watched the Brute of Bracken take his turn, and then Lord Caron of the Marches.**


4. **Both POVs watch a lithe knight beat down a large knight who gets his head injured. Both POVs recocgnize the knights via their shields:**


   *Sansa's POV:*

&gt; **A few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws.A few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp**


   *Dunk's POV:*

&gt; **Elsewhere, men were training afoot, going at each other with wooden swords while their squires stood shouting ribald advice. Dunk watched a stocky youth try to hold off a muscular knight who seemed lithe and quick as a mountain cat. Both had the red apple of the Fossoways painted on their shields, but the younger man’s was soon hacked and chipped to pieces. “Here’s an apple that’s not ripe yet,” the older said as he slammed the other’s helm.The younger Fossoway was bruised and bloody by the time he yielded, but his foe was hardly winded**



Then there are other important parallels which may come to play later on: (As pointed out by Preston Jacobs)


-  Both tourneys have Hardyngs doomed to die by falling off their horses while jousting (**Harry and Humphrey**)

- Both tourneys have mysterious Hedge knights with fake shields who clearly lie about their origin and end up uppending the whole Tourney (**Ser Shadrich and Ser Dunk**)

- Both tourneys have organizers manipulating the lists in order to make someone win (**Petyr favoring Harry and Lord Ashford favoring Prince Valarr Targaryen**)

- Both tourneys have Kingsguard in an important role (**Aerion targaryen's kingsguard and Sweetrobin's kingsguard aka Winged knights**)


- Both tourneys have people who gatecrash the tourney at the last minute and cause chaos (**Aerion targaryen and Vale mountain clans(predicted)**)


- Then, the Vale tourney also has a nice callback to an iconic moment in the Ashford tourney - **Baelor targaryen's death** - by having Lothor brune slam his competitor's helmet in causing his head to bleed.


- There's also the fact that Dunk originally had a House Whent shield transformed into a new one and Sansa's grandmother is a Whent and Sansa has bat imagery throughout the series.



Can anyone predict the Vale tourney's endgame with respect to these clues? I personally think as Dunk's descendant, Brienne *must* have some role in this. 

I believe Brienne will save the girl the same way her ancestor Dunk did at Ashford.",asoiaf,[Spoilers extended] Paralleled passages - Vale tourney and Ashford tourney

There was never a particular incident that would have explained why Arya kept pretending to be someone else, even in the presence of her brother's bannermen?

1686,"The prologue to *A Game of Thrones* makes use of two skill-intensive storytelling devices that indicate GRRM doesn’t settle for the easy way out.

Rather, like a good writing professional, he gauges a situation that could have been mundane and forgettable, and puts a different spin to make it memorable.

Let’s look at the first of the two techniques he calls upon in the prologue.

# Elegant Exposition

Exposition is the craft of inserting background information in a story--the more elegant the better.

Imagine a story in which main character Jane Doe hates a rival dynasty: House Horrendous. There are two approaches to conveying that.

* **Show Don’t Tell**: “Jane took her time reading each entry on the Great Houses of the Empire. Only when she arrived at the entry for House Horrendous did she swipe the page aside with barely a glance, her soft expression distorting into a glare. Her features relaxed and her breathing slowed down when she began the next entry, but not for a while.”
* **Tell Don’t Show**: “Jane took her time reading each entry on the Great Houses of the Empire. But she refused to read anything about House Horrendous, the curs who had killed her grandfather and nearly bankrupted her family. She went on to the next entry, but she had a hard time not thinking of how good it would feel to destroy that malevolent family once and for all.”

We can argue about which passage is more engaging, but I believe the first example is more indicative of elegant exposition.

It illustrates the information instead of spelling it out. Both are acceptable means of doing exposition, but the former demands more effort and skill from the writer.

Like most authors, Martin makes use of both approaches in his fiction, but it’s “Show Don’t Tell” I want to focus on. Here are some examples.

In the next passage, Martin makes a subtle reference to how the seasons in Westeros go on for much longer than in our world:

&gt;“It was the cold,” Gared said with iron certainty. **“I saw men freeze last winter, and the**  
&gt;  
&gt;**one before, when I was half a boy**. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how  
&gt;  
&gt;the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold.

Gared has already been singled out as a man in his fifties. He references the most recent winter, and the one before that--when he was only **half a boy**.

Meaning each of the four seasons must have lasted years if a man in his fifties has only experienced two winters.

So, instead of saying that outright, Martin slips in a subtle indication so we the readers can put two and two together.

For other examples of artful Show Don’t Tell, we may turn to the character of Waymar Royce.

Royce clearly sees himself as superior to Gared and Will, and his attitude proves it. But there’s a perfect illustration that may get lost in the narrative:

&gt;When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, **well away from the other horses**, and drew his longsword from its sheath.

As if even Royce’s horse is too good to mingle with horses from the “riff-raff.” It’s a small detail, but a telling one.  Admittedly, I might be reaching with these examples, but judge for yourself:

&gt;“What do you think might have killed **these men**, Gared?” Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Royce nodded. “Bright lad. We’ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight **grown men**. **Men** clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.”

Notice how Royce always refers to the wildlings as “men,” even though Will had previously said there are women among the wildlings.

That could be Royce (and Martin) just using a simple word (“men”) to make his sentences shorter, but given how the chapter is emphasizing Royce’s inexperience, I wonder if it could be a way of showing he is:

A) Inexperienced about warrior wildling women

B) Sexist because of his Westerosi upbringing

C) All of the above.

Can’t speak for you, but I’d go with “c.”

I obviously prefer elegant exposition, but don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying Martin is a mediocre writer when he goes for a more tell-don’t-show approach.

Whatever approach he chooses, he is entertaining his audience with an engaging story, so he’s doing his job well.

But the point of this post is to shine a spotlight on what I love about his writing, not just what I like. And I believe his elegant exposition merits celebration.

However, there’s something I love even more than his talent for exposition.

# Battle of Persuasion

In my eyes, the “set piece” of the prologue is the confrontation between Royce on one side, Will and Gared on the other.

I love it because it is an intellectual confrontation, where one contender tries to influence the other’s decision by way of logical arguments.

And it didn’t have to be that way.

Royce could have used his authority straightaway to command Gared and Will to show him the wildlings, and avoid all that talk about freezing, weeping walls, etc.

And Martin could have saved himself the trouble of writing a long scene for a bunch of characters who will all be dead before even 0.5% of the story is told.

Of course, then we wouldn’t have evidence that Martin is a pro at exceeding expectations. The key element in this type of confrontation is to keep the contenders as evenly matched as possible. Otherwise, it’s not a confrontation; it’s just one contender beating the snot out of the other.

Here are the beats of their verbal battle:

* Gared and Will insist the wildlings must be dead

&gt;“Will saw them,” Gared said. **“If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. **“My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,”** he put in.

* Royce is not convinced, asks pointed questions

&gt;**“Did you see any blood?”**  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, no,” Will admitted.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“Did you see any weapons?”**  
&gt;  
&gt;“Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**“Did you make note of the position of the bodies?”**

* Gared insists the cold must have killed them

&gt;“It was the cold,” Gared said with iron certainty. “I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy.

* Royce retorts by saying it hasn’t been cold enough to kill eight grown men at once.

&gt;Royce nodded. “Bright lad. We’ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. **Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire**.”

Both sides of the argument are built primarily on logic and very specific points. If the reasoning for either side were vague, then the confrontation would feel one-sided and lose most of its pull.

In other words, the drama would be diluted.

Now, I’ve emphasized logic, but don’t think emotion is out of the picture--it’s just in the background.

There’s the **resentment** Gared feels at having to obey someone much younger and inexperienced than he.

And Royce’s **pride** is pushing him to ensure his first mission for the Watch ends in success no matter what.

The emotion is there, fueling the intellectual duel, it’s just not front and center.

High intellect ensures there’ll be an engaging back-and-forth, while emotions guarantee the characters will be properly **motivated**. This approach is so strong that film classics like *The Godfather* and *Pulp Fiction* used similar persuasion-style confrontations for their opening segments.

If you’re interested in memorable confrontations in that vein, I recommend issue #9 of *Watchmen* and the RV scene in season 3, episode 6 of *Breaking Bad*.

Keep in mind there was no obligation to feature a well thought-out debate between characters that’ll die within a few pages. Yet it’s that approach that makes the prologue stand out, and provides substance to otherwise expendable characters.

That is how a professional works. They turn a potentially generic situation into something memorable and full of nuance.

Kudos to Martin for going above and beyond.

Beside the promised five new illustrations and a transcription of GRRM's talk with D, there are also a few text updates to fix previous bugs. The reasons of most changes are already mentioned in the  [Errata](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Errata_of_Fire_%26_Blood) :

# Aegon I

* The king himself marched northwest, to the Gods Eye and **the newly completed** Harrenhal, the gargantuan fortress that was the pride and obsession of King Harren the Black. 

bold text are added, since F&amp;B didn't mention Harrenhal was completed on the same day of Aegon's Landing, which was established in ACOK and TWOIAF.

* This was not something the Targaryens would allow to go unanswered. Later that same year, Visenya Targaryen appeared in the skies of Dorne, and Vhagar’s fires were loosed upon ~~Sunspear,~~ Lemonwood, Ghost Hill, and the Tor. 
* The next two years were the years of the Dragon’s Wroth. Every castle in Dorne**, save Sunspear** was burned thrice over, as Balerion and Vhagar returned time and time again.  

#   Sons of the Dragon

* His death is generally accounted as the end of the Second Dornish War, though that is somewhat of a misnomer, since ~~no~~**few** Dornish lords ever took the field, and Princess Deria continued to vilify the Vulture King until his end and took no part in his campaigns.
* In the days that followed, the dungeons of King’s Landing were **largely** emptied. After being given food and drink and clean raiment, the captives were escorted to the throne room seven at a time.

# Jaehaerys I

* Those were dangerous words during the reign of Maegor the Cruel, but if Rogar Baratheon feared Maegor’s wroth, he hid it well. Men who knew him were unsurprised when he gave shelter to Queen Alyssa and her children after their flight from ~~King’s Landing~~**Dragonstone**, and when he was the first to proclaim Prince Jaehaerys king.
* So beautiful, so brave, so tragic, women said of her. Even such lords as might have balked at a woman ruling over them were willing to accept her as their liege, secure in the knowledge that she had Rogar Baratheon standing beside her, and the young king ~~less~~**~~l~~****ittle** more than a year away from his sixteenth nameday.
* The names of the other six who went forth to speak for Jaehaerys would in time become nigh as famous as the queen’s. Three were ~~young~~ septons; cunning Septon Baldrick, learned Septon Rollo, and fierce old Septon Alfyn, who had lost his legs years before and was carried everywhere in a litter.
* The **better part of the** year continued without further crisis or test as Jaehaerys and Alysanne settled in to rule. If certain members of the small council were taken aback when the queen began to attend their meetings, they voiced their objections only to one another…and soon not even that, for the young queen proved to be wise, well-read, and clever, a welcome voice in any discussion.

Prince Baelon was firmly ensconced as heir apparent by then, yet House Velaryon and House Baratheon clung to the belief that young Laenor had a better claim to the Iron Throne, and some few even argued for the rights of his elder sister, Laena, and their mother, Rhaenys.
* Though ~~only~~**not yet** forty years of age, Vaegon was pale and frail, a bookish man devoted to alchemy, astronomy, mathematics, and other arcane arts.
* In these efforts they were joined by the Lord of Storm’s End, Boremund Baratheon (~~great-~~uncle to Rhaenys and ~~great-~~great-uncle to the boy Laenor), by Lord Stark of Winterfell, Lord Manderly of White Harbor, Lord Dustin of Barrowton, Lord Blackwood of Raventree, Lord Bar Emmon of Sharp Point, Lord Celtigar of Claw Isle, and others.

## Aegon III

* What remained of Aegon’s court had gathered in the hall, amongst them Lord Larys Strong the Clubfoot, Grand Maester Orwyle, Ser Perkin the Flea, Mushroom, Septon Eustace, Ser Gyles Belgrave and ~~four~~**three** other Kingsguard, and sundry lesser lords and household knights.

* Lady Baratheon’s father, Royce Caron, Lord of Nightsong and ~~Marshal~~**Lord** of the Marches, escorted the girls to the city, and would remain with them as their guardian.
* The remainder of the year 131 AC was a time of departures, as the great lords of Westeros took their leaves of King’s Landing one by one to return to their own seats of power. Amongst the first to flee were **two of** the Three Widows **who were present**, after bidding tearful farewells to the daughters, son, siblings, and cousins who would remain to serve the new king and queen as companions and hostages. **With Lady Sam went her paramour Lord Lyonel, riding south for Oldtown with their Hightowers, whilst Lords Rowan, Beesbury, Costayne, Tarly, and Redwyne joined to escort His High Holiness to the same destination.** Cregan Stark led his much-diminished host north along the kingsroad within a fortnight of the coronation; three days later, Lord Blackwood and Lady Alysanne set out for Raventree, with a thousand of Stark’s northerners as a tail. ~~Lord Lyonel and his paramour, the Lady Sam, rode south for Oldtown with their Hightowers, whilst Lords Rowan, Beesbury, Costayne, Tarly, and Redwyne joined to escort His High Holiness to the same destination.~~
* Ser Willis Fell agreed. “It must be Rhaena. She has a dragon, her sister does not.” When Lord ~~Corbray~~**Mooton** answered, “Baela flew a dragon, Rhaena only has the hatchling,”

* but Ser Willis Fell, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, was struck down ~~together with two of his Sworn Brothers~~.
* It behooves us now to pause for a moment and turn our gaze upon Unwin Peake, who would rule the Seven Kingdoms in all but name for the best part of ~~three~~**two** years, serving as Lord Regent, Protector of the Realm, and Hand of the King.
* The court rejoiced when Lady Rhaena announced that she was with child by Lord **Corwyn** Corbray, but joy turned to grief a moon’s turn later when she miscarried.
* Though his japes could not dispel~~l~~ the king’s gloom, they delighted Gaemon Palehair, so Aegon oft summoned him for the boy’s sake.
* “She sparkled,” Mushroom says, “and when she smiled, the singers in the galle**r**y rejoiced, for they knew that here at last was a maid worthy of a song.” Daenaera’s smile transformed her face, men agreed; it was sweet and bold and mischiev~~i~~ous, all at once.
* The others were women of the west, taken during his conquests, amongst them two of the late Lord Farman’s **surviving** daughters, the widow of the Knight of Kayce, even a Lannister 
* Peace reigned over King’s Landing for the remainder of that year, marred only by the death of Manfryd Mooton, Lord of Maidenpool and **nearly** the last of King Aegon’s original regents.
* High in the mountains, the unthinkable happened one night as ~~Lord~~**Ser** Robert and his men huddled about their campfires.

* Ser Gareth Long was the most volu~~a~~ble, declaring loudly that Aegon III was a weakling unfit to hold a sword, much less sit the Iron Throne.
* Ser Gareth Long, ~~first and~~ foremost of those who had named Risley part of the plot, was duly brought back to court to face him.
* Lady Elend~~r~~a, was not well enough to attend the trials, she had sent three of her son’s bannermen to speak for Storm’s End…It was Lady Elend~~r~~a’s thought that caring for these children and any additional sons or daughters that she herself might give Ser Walter would keep Lady Cassandra from plotting any further treasons.

1689,"So, I've been working my way through all the audio books again in order and I can't help but notice an odd trend. We know for a fact that Lords usually marry bannermen or those nearby, and the sort of giant entangling alliances that led to Robert's Rebellion aren't common.

 The Blackwoods however are all over the place. Osgreys,  Starks, Targs... I just can't find myself trusting a centrally- located-monster-weirwood-having House that led to Bloodraven and the spread of all that greenseer blood...

Is there a plan? Some sort of centuries long machination? How many eyes does Raventree Hall have?",asoiaf,Blackwood Blood (Spoilers Published)
1692,"In retrospect Stannis is too far away, and the guesses on who else might sacrifice Shireen seem scattershot. 

Too much is made of Melisandre's cruelty. She'd do it if she must, be she is not just a cold hearted killer. 

Example: she keeps Devan as her serving boy because she thinks Davos has suffered enough. This is the same man who tried to kill her and also worships the false god (sevens).  

If there comes a need of Kings blood, Mel thinks they have Dalla's boy (monster) so he'd be a much better alternative. 

However to our surprise (Jon's surprise) Val thinks they should send Shireen away to die since she is 'death' (Greyscales). She also wants her away from monster suggesting she has become fond of Gilly's boy. Its easy to think of Val as a nice girl, especially from Jon's perspective since he doesn't have time for highborn stuck ups (Think his relationship with Arya vs. Sansa). 

But as pretty and normal as she seems, she is a wildling who grew up in harsh environments and isn't just another southron girl who likes to get her hands dirty. 

So she gets wind that they mean to sacrifice monster (they think is Dalla's son), and Jon isn't around to protect him. She takes matters into her own hand and some how switches the person on the stake with Shireen. 

Val knows monster has no kings blood, but Shireen does so she figures it probably would be more practical anyways.",asoiaf,"What if Val is responsible for Shireen's fate? [spoilers, main]"

1699,"I want to start a weekly series of discussion posts on each of the many houses within Westeros and discuss what we believe will happen to them by the end of ASOIAF so today I'm going to start with House Martell - what do you all think will become of House Martell by the end of ASOIAF?

The current members of the Martell branch that we've seen and are still alive by the end of ADWD are: Doran Martell, Arianne Martell, Quentyn Martell(?), Trystane Martell and the many Sand Snakes.

**Doran Martell**

In the show, Doran Martell and his youngest son Trystane were both brutally murdered by the Sand Snakes for their indecisiveness and reluctance to avenge Oberyn's death against the Lannisters. In the books, I think something similar will happen but for different reasons; when Arianne confirms to Doran that she believes fAegon is the real deal (Because she'll want to be his Queen being so power hungry) and that Quentyn was killed by Daenerys' dragons, Doran will be left struggling to decide which royal claimant to back through his children - Arianne and fAegon or Trystane and Myrcella. The news of Quentyn's death will plague him with grief and make him question his loyalty to the Targaryens as well as his fear of Daenerys eventually coming to Westeros.

Ultimately, I don't think Doran will be able to choose between his children and he has figuratively put all of his apples in too many different baskets so to speak. When the Sand Snakes confront him and pressure him to commit the Dornish Army to fAegon's cause, I think he will initially refuse out of caution and seek greater clarity on what happened to Quentyn before he burns bridges completely with Daenerys. Enraged, the Sand Snakes will murder Doran, paving the way for Arianne to take over as Lady of Sunspear and ruling Princess of Dorne and, through Arianne, the Sand Snakes will push for the Dornish to back fAegon and invade King's Landing.

**Arianne Martell**

Of all the Martells, I am most convinced that Arianne will survive the series.

As I discussed above, I think Arianne will seek out fAegon, believe him to be the real deal and pledge the support of the Dornish Army only if he marries her and makes her his Queen. I believe fAegon will hastily agree to this but will cast her aside in favour of Sansa Stark when he encounters her (Mirroring the love triangle between Rhaegar, Lyanna and Elia) and Arianne will feel used. After learning of her father's death, Quentyn's death and seeing the brutality of Jon Con's sack of King's Landing, I think Arianne will be left with a sour taste in her mouth and realise that this push for power was not worth it at all.

Arianne's story arc seems to be one of learning what it means to have power rather than wanting it so much. Indeed, the Martells have historically been very ambitious and power hungry since Robert's Rebellion and I think this is their downfall. Arianne spent her whole life desperately wanting her father to recognise her as an equal alongside her brothers and to make her his heir; I think she'll get what she wants in succeeding him as ruler of Dorne, but it will come at the cost of her whole family and many more innocent lives. In AFFC she led the failed Queenmaker Coup which led to Arys' death and Myrcella's maiming, something which still haunts Arianne and led to her showdown of revelations with her father, all of which has changed her outlook. I think the series will end with her refusing to back anymore throne claimants after fAegon's death and Daenerys' burning of King's Landing and she'll back Bran Stark when he pushes for elective monarchy in Westeros, something that she'll deem fairer.

**Quentyn Martell**

Some fans believe that Quentyn is still alive despite the dragons burning him so badly and I confess that I find some of the details in his companions' story to Barristan a bit confusing and questionable, but for the rest of the series I believe Quentyn is most likely dead in terms of pacing and there not being enough plot left to expand on Quentyn's character. His death will push the Martells away from the Targaryens, something that'll be important to the endgame of the series.

**Trystane Martell**

As in the show, I think Trystane will be another unfortunate victim of the upcoming wars in TWOW and he'll be killed by Lannister agents, or perhaps instead by Daenerys' forces when she invades Westeros. When Doran gets word of Quentyn's death, he'll have to make a choice between backing his daughter Arianne and fAegon or his last living son Trystane and Myrcella for the Iron Throne and his indecisiveness will lead to both his death and his last son's death too. Trystane is unfortunately a necessary casualty to pave the way for the Lannisters to fall completely from power.

**The Sand Snakes**

With the exception of Sarella, I think all of the older Sand Snakes will die before the series ends and the younger ones raised by Ellaria will survive as background minor characters.

I think Obara is probably going to be killed in an upcoming three-way showdown between herself, Areo and Balon Swann once the Darkstar lets slip the full truth behind the Queenmaker plot but part of me also thinks she may be involved in the plot around Oldtown for her background tied to that city.

Nymeria and Tyene are probably going to die in King's Landing, my instinct is that once Robert Strong is revealed to be the Mountain at Cersei's upcoming Trial by Combat, the Sand Snakes will seek immediate revenge by trying to kill Tommen. For a time I thought they'd be successful but now I've come to think it will instead fail and their actions will give Cersei opportunity to accuse the High Sparrow of trying to kill the King through his appointment of one of the Sand Snakes as a Silent Sister.

Finally, I have high hopes for Sarella Sand surviving the series after Alleras the Sphinx is revealed to be her and think she'll end up as Bran's Grand Maester on her Small Council instead of Sam as it would be more progressive and telling in a new age of Westeros for the Grand Maester to be a woman.

**Bonus Tinfoil: Lewyn Martell**

A while ago, I read an excellent theory postulating that Lewyn Martell's paramour while he was in the Kingsguard was none other than Genna Lannister and another claiming that he faked his death then went on to become the Elder Brother at the Quiet Isle. Lewyn is another mysterious character in the lore that I'd like to see more developed upon one day.

1700,"I just finished re-reading the series and still I genuinely cannot understand why Jon wouldn't take Stannis' offer and become Jon Stark, rightful Lord of Winterfell. The way I see it, he could retake Winterfell (avenging his family whom he probably cares about at least a little), and then bring a Northern host up for the fight against the Walkers. 

Would it be dishonorable even if he was pardoned and legitimized by Stannis?

He had shown commitment and loyalty to her their entire time together but she slaps him and takes out her anger out him as she pleases, without as much of a thank you for all he has done. This never gets brought up again because of how forgiving Jorah is as a person.

It's part of a bigger problem I have with Daenerys' choice in partners, she has someone who truly loves her for who she is as a person, but it seems like she's just drawn to complete assholes like Drogo and Daario because she's attracted to them. She'd even rather force her slave handmaidens to be human vibrators lol.

1709,"I have to acknowledge that I'm only around halfway through a clash of kings, (When I wrote this that was true. I am now about 5 or so chapters into a Storm of Swords.) but I can't stop thinking about a lot of the stupid decisions that Balon has made.   

For starters, I have absolutely no idea what he was trying to accomplish with his little rebellion against Robert about 5 years after Rob usurped the mad king of his throne. I've read up on it a decent amount and I still can not understand what he hoped to accomplish with this rebellion. If he was just trying to become independent from the Seven Kingdoms then I have no idea why he would feel the need to send out almost the entirety of the iron fleet on coastal raids, which he ended up losing of course. Would it really have been all that hard to have your fleet defend your island nation? Not to mention the fact that the Ironborn are renowned for their seafaring, small in number, and live on freakin islands, which if you didn't know are surrounded by water. Nope, screw all that. We'll send one of our larger fleets through a strait to have them be overtaken from both sides. With how poorly Balon went about defending the Iron Islands, that leads me to believe his goal may have been to conquer the seven kingdoms. If that was the case, well then I guess he truly is a moron.

Next, his ploy to take a portion of the north wasn't as stupid, but, I mean, it wasn't too smart either. Just based on geography alone it would have been much easier for the Ironborn to take Casterly Rock as Robb had proposed. I genuinely feel like the only reason Balon said no is because of pride. I get that most of the North was left undefended, but how exactly did Balon plan to hold the North afterwards? At least in the South they would be much closer to the islands. Do the Ironborn genuinely think they can take the seven kingdoms or something? If that's not the case, I see no reason why they wouldn't just declare themselves independent like the North had and fight off anybody who tries to say otherwise.   

I'm aware that this is all fiction and a lot of the Ironborn are probably written this way on purpose, but it's still frustrating to see nonetheless. I just really like the Ironborn's culture and it's a tad annoying to see them make dumb decision after dumb decision. Maybe I'm missing something though because I have no idea how anything Balon did could be considered well thought out.

Edit: I typed this up while I was still in the midst of a clash of kings, but my stance still hasn't really changed. Asha does provide some sound logic for what she's doing, but that's really only logical if you think Balon had a good plan to begin with lol.",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Main) Is it just me or are the Ironborn, specifically Balon Greyjoy, as dumb as they seem?"

1719,"Tyroshi trade was largely established around a rare dye produced from snails in the area. Which is definitely meant as a parallel with Phoenicia who also were known for their rare dye produced from snails in the area. This color being known as Tyrian Purple which is a reference to the city of Tyre. So there's obvious some real world inspiration going on here. 

What I also want to point out is maybe less intentional but still a decent parallel.

One prominent Phoenician settlement was Carthage, which becomes the focal point of the empire after their homeland was invaded. Well Carthage (a continuation of Phoenicia) was involved in a series of wars known as the Punic Wars in which they fought Rome for control of the Mediterranean Sea and therefore trade. During the 2nd Punic war the Carthage general Hannibal, who was largely motivated by a need to avenge his father's defeat in the 1st Punic war, famously marched his army including war elephants thru the alps to invade Rome from the north. Now neither Hannibal, nor Carthage ever won these wars but they were a huge threat to Rome at the time.

Now back to Westeros, one of the biggest threats to the Targaryen's rule during their reign was the series of Blackfyre Rebellions led first by Daemon I Blackfyre and later by his descendants. Who were products of his marriage to Rohanne of Tyrosh making all future Blackfyre's also Tyroshi. Parallels can therefore be made between the Blackfyre Rebellions and the Punic Wars. Most notably how they were fighting for economical control and power and how they were seemingly passing down wars to the next generations.

Lastly I mentioned Hannibal and his famous Elephants. And what character in our story has elephants? Aegon. Widely believed to be a Blackfyre. Now I'm not saying he is a Blackfyre or that this detail has any bearing on if he is or isn't but just a fun parallel I noticed.

Is it possible that, in a parallel to Ice, Dark Sister could be given to a Lannister? I would be cool for it to go to Jaime in the War against the Others, to see him slay an Other with the ancestral sword of the Targaryens. Otherwise, I don’t think that Jon would give up Longclaw (unless it goes to Jorah and Jon takes Dark Sister), but my second guess would be Meera Reed, so she could help defend Westeros against the White Walkers, almost like Ned and Howland (The Northern cave in a parallel to the Dornish Tower of Joy). I also think Arya could be a cool person to take it, an using it take out as many Others as possible, especially as the show seemed to convince us that Arya would relinquish Needle for the Battle of Winterfell.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) Dark Sister and Ice

1733,"I have heard a theory recently, that catastrophic natural events caused by magic woke the others. The first time it was the hammer of the waters caused by the magic of the children of the forest. AWOIAF says that after this ""giants woke from the earth"". Joramunds Horn is also a magic weapon, which could make the wall collapse (perhaps with an earthquake) and wake giants from the earth.

A few hundred years before the current story, Valyria was destroyed by a catastrophic natural event, that could also be caused by magic. The kindly man hints that the faceless man had something to do with the doom. Both events were caused by magic and a few hundred years later the Others were strong enough to attack mankind.

Could the magic, which is set free in this events, caused the slowly awakening of the others? Or are there different theories on that topic?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main) What woke the others?
1736," 

On my fourth re-read and i had a wild thought. Reek has a pretty good relationship with Ramsays hounds. They are really savage but they kind of like Reek since he has spent so much time with them. They know and like his smell, play with him and he think they are good dogs even tho they are named after Ramsay’s poor victims. What if he’ll be the one who sets them loose on Ramsay like Sansa did in the show? It would be a really satisfying revenge for all the horrors Ramsay put him through.

Of course there are problems. Just because he is friendly with them wont mean they’ll obey him. Reek is also not in Winterfell any more and has reclaimed his old name Theon. But i somehow think they’ll meet again.

I dunno, probably wont happen but it would be sweet.

1737,"While supposedly looking for the Horn of Winter for his upcoming [invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/i2wmxq/the_wildling_invasions_timelines_thoughts_and/) the wildlings supposedly opened numerous graves.

&gt;""Not for fear!"" She kicked savagely at the ice beneath her with a heel, chopping out a chunk. **""I'm crying because we never found the Horn of Winter. We opened half a hundred graves and let all those shades loose in the world, and never found the Horn of Joramun to bring this cold thing down!**"" -ASOS, Jon IV

and:

&gt;""They all do,"" said Jon. **""Ygritte said they opened a hundred graves . . . graves of kings and heroes**, all over the valley of the Milkwater, but they never . . ."" -ASOS, Jon VI

**So what I started to wonder was whose graves did they open? Which heroes/kings?**

***

**The wildlings are referred to as heroes numerous times**

They refer to themselves, others refer to them as heroes, etc. 

Jon to Ygritte:

&gt;**Wildlings fought like heroes or demons**, depending on who you talked to, but it came down to the same thing in the end. They fight with reckless courage, every man out for glory. ""I don't doubt that you're all very brave, but when it comes to battle, discipline beats valor every time. In the end Mance will fail as all the Kings-beyond-the-Wall have failed before him. And when he does, you'll die. All of you."" -ASOS, Jon V

Val:

&gt;Val had reminded him of that, on his last visit with her. **""Free folk and kneelers are more alike than not, Jon Snow. Men are men and women women, no matter which side of the Wall we were born on. Good men and bad, heroes and villains, men of honor, liars, cravens, brutes … we have plenty, as do you.""** -ADWD, Jon V

Thoren Smallwood:

&gt;""I know them as well as you do, Buckwell,"" Thoren Smallwood snapped back. ""And I mean to have their heads, every one. These are wildlings. No soldiers. **A few hundred heroes**, drunk most like, amidst a great horde of women, children, and thralls. We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels. -ACOK, Jon V

But it should also be noted: **The Wildlings burn their dead:**

&gt;When he brought the skull to Mormont, the Old Bear lifted it in both hands and stared into the empty sockets. ""**The wildlings burn their dead. We've always known that. Now I wished I'd asked them why, when there were still a few around to ask.""** 

&gt;Jon Snow remembered the wight rising, its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face. **He knew why, he was certain.**

&gt;**""Would that bones could talk,"" the Old Bear grumbled. ""This fellow could tell us much. How he died. Who burned him, and why. Where the wildlings have gone."" He sighed. ""The children of the forest could speak to the dead, it's said.** But I can't."" He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree, where it landed with a puff of fine ash. ""Go through all these houses. Giant, get to the top of this tree, have a look. I'll have the hounds brought up too. Perchance this time the trail will be fresher."" His tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last.

&gt;Two men went through each house, to make certain nothing was missed. Jon was paired with dour Eddison Tollett, a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike, whom the other brothers called Dolorous Edd. ""Bad enough when the dead come walking,"" he said to Jon as they crossed the village, ""now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will come of that, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie? Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints—the ground's too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does he get more worms than I do . . .""-ACOK, Jon II

and:

&gt;By late afternoon the snow was falling steadily, but the river of wildlings had dwindled to a stream. **Columns of smoke rose from the trees where their camp had been. ""Toregg,"" Tormund explained. ""Burning the dead. Always some who go to sleep and don't wake up. You find them in their tents, them as have tents, curled up and froze. Toregg knows what to do.""** -ADWD, Jon XII

***

So the wildlings opened graves in the frostfangs belonging to heroes/kings, but the wildlings custom is to burn their dead. So that means that the wildlings are ~~obviously Valyrian/secret targs~~ are opening graves from before the long night or their are some cultures that don't follow this death process.

It should be also noted that they looked in a giant's grave as well:

&gt;""Did she?"" Tormund slapped his thigh and hooted. ""She burned that fine big horn, aye. A bloody sin, I call it. A thousand years old, that was. **We found it in a giant's grave**, and no man o' us had ever seen a horn so big. That must have been why Mance got the notion to tell you it were Joramun's. He wanted you crows to think he had it in his power to blow your bloody Wall down about your knees. But we never found the true horn, not for all our digging. If we had, every kneeler in your Seven Kingdoms would have chunks o' ice to cool his wine all summer."" -ADWD, Jon XII

So if we put all this together:

- Mance is up in the Frostfangs (out of the way for what he is trying to accomplish)

- Searching for ""some power"" (Horn of Winter), how he knew to look there is great question

- Opened numerous graves (kings/hero/giants)

- Possibly let ""shades loose into the earth"" (although this contradicts with Mance's supposed reason for going south, although some of his followers have different goals/agendas)

- Wildlings burn their dead

So my guess is that it could involve the Long Night/Last Hero:

&gt;How the Long Night came to an end is a matter of legend, as all such matters of the distant past have become. **In the North, they tell of a last hero who sought out the intercession of the children of the forest, his companions abandoning him or dying one by one as they faced ravenous giants, cold servants, and the Others themselves. Alone he finally reached the children, despite the efforts of the white walkers, and all the tales agree this was a turning point. Thanks to the children, the first men of the Night's Watch banded together and were able to fight—and win—the Battle for the Dawn: the last battle that broke the endless winter and sent the Others fleeing to the icy north.** Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night's Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries. -TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Long Night

But the letting shades loose is definitely paralleled by the crypts of winterfell:

&gt;By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. **The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now.** -AGOT, Eddard I

and:

&gt;He was trapped here, with the ghosts. **The old ghosts from the crypts** and the younger ones that he had made himself, Mikken and Farlen, Gynir Rednose, Aggar, Gelmarr the Grim, the miller's wife from Acorn Water and her two young sons, and all the rest. My work. My ghosts. They are all here, and they are angry. He thought of the crypts and those missing swords. -ADWD, A Ghost in Winterfell

***

I had a few more quotes I was going to include but they tended to focus on ""some power""/the horn and it seemed the post was turning more into a discussion of them looking for that instead of what could have occurred that left bodies/graves up there and that Mance knew to go there and look.
**TLDR: Since the wildlings burn their dead, a battle or massacre, etc. must have occurred before they began to do so (assuming as a result of the Long Night) up in the valley of the Milkwater/Frostfangs**",asoiaf,The Graves of Kings and Heroes (and Giants) in the Frostfangs (Spoilers Extended)
1738,"Obviously this is assuming it ever comes out of course.

Personally i am most excited for Baelor the Blessed’s rule, since he’s just such an polar opposite of most Targaryen rulers, who constantly go against everything the 7-Pointed Star stands for.

Besides that there are the obvious answers of the Blackfyre rebellions and seeing characters from ASOIAF in their younger days: Ned, Robert, Jaime etc.

All in all Fire and Blood 2 has a lot of potential if it ever gets written.

1740,"There was a comment chain in another post about how the show and the actors involved had some...interesting accent choices. This got me thinking and I figured I'd post a thread just for accents in the show and how it corresponds to your expectations for accents based off the book. A few of my thoughts are below but I'd love to hear yours.

Ned with his Yorkshire accent is pretty much exactly how I heard it in my head on first reading. That was spot on I think.

I pictured the Ironborn with an Irish accent, weirdly in my head it was Cork but I don't know why that was. 

I pictured the Lannisters having a Lancashire accent, but I think that's because of the War of the Roses vs the Stark's York thing.

Pictured the Vale as South Welsh, but the mountain clans being more Welsh-as-first-language sorts

Figured the Dornish would sound Catalan for some reason - not sure why I had that idea 

Thought the Tyrell family would sound like the Oxbridge educated academic who retired to be a gentleman farmer/gardener

Genuinely just pictured the Baratheons as different voices of Brian Blessed - Robert the Booming Brian Blessed, Stannis the Bemused Brian Blessed, and Renly the Bubbly Brian Blessed.

King's Landing I genuinely didn't have an accent for. Not Cockney, because I think that's too modern for the setting? Maybe Brummie? I don't know.

I thought the Riverlands might be the East Midlands, for no real reason.

And lastly, I read Joff as having Veruca Salt's voice from Willy Wonka.

I'm not British so my perceptions of these accents may be skewed, but for some reason when I read fantasy the accents in my head tend to be different British (and usually English) ones.",asoiaf,"(Spoilers Extended) Accents, the Show, and Your Reading Voice for the Characters"

1742,"There is a concept called comedic relief. 

Its been used for so long some people could mistake it for a storytelling trope, but its actually pretty awful. It ruins the immersion, themes, and pacing of a story. 

Shakespeare used it in his tragedies to give audience members a break and time to cool down. To his credit he often used extras or secondary characters for this purpose, like the grave diggers in Romeo and Juliet. 

Sadly, this dated story telling mechanic was taken seriously by HBO, and actually applied to several scenes or more. The books comparatively weave humor into intense scenes in a way that is natural and yet can feel hysterical at the same time. 

The show actual takes the main characters, makes them forget their personal arcs, just to throw a few quips here and there. Tyrion and Varys have a break where they talk about balls, Jaime has a whole buddy cop comedy plot line with Bronn trying to covertly sneak into Dorne and steal away the princess. 

Yeah so this could make show watchers hate humor as it takes away from the meat of the show, but it doesn't have to be that way. 

Yes Tyrion is more inclined to humor, so his scenes can be used to forward the plot without derailing his characterization. When Illyrio meets up with Duck and the halfmaester, Tyrion comes out and sees two guys that are like roaming bandits. He thinks Illyrio knows what he's getting into, but also really needs him alive. Anyways he says: ""'Are these two known to you, Magister? They look like outlaws, should I find my axe'"" (ADWD, pg.112). 

But these sort of situations are unique to Tyrion who has a very clear understanding of his physical disabilities and lack of help in such a situation.  

The other example is when italicized thoughts are used to add comedic value to a scene or conversation where it shouldn't otherwise exist. When Davos is speaking in court to Wyman Manderly, he announces himself as Hand of the king, and is then denigrated as a smuggler. Wyman brings up his history of smuggling in white harbor and questions how much food Davos has taken from the mouths of his domain. To which Davos adds *not enough that you ever missed a meal*. 

His job is to treat with the lord of white harbor, and it would be a betrayal of his character and the world for him to say this aloud. It would make a mockery of these preceding and the social norms of westeros. But people have less control over what they think rather than what they say. The same is true with most of Jon's chapters.  

The third and last type of comedic value I noticed is changes in writing. On a side notes characters with powerful delusions like Cersei or Aeron are fun to read, but it becomes more obvious when there is a shift in pacing/writing from one chapter to another. 

Victarion is a man of low intelligence, but in his first chapter in Dance, he is wary of Euron's plans, he worries this dragon queen is a farce, his concerned about the Volantene fleet behind him, and most of the chapter is waste worrying about the logistics of the iron fleet and all his lost ships. There is also a subplot where his arm is infected, and the maester is not healing it. 

The chapter is very slow and boring, and makes you worried to see if Victarion will ever actual reach Meereen. Then at the end of the chapter he meets Moqorro, his hand gets fixed, and he kills the maester. 

Everything changes in the next chapter. Where before he was worried about Euron's plots, now he has his own mage with him. His wounded hand is stronger than ever, and his confidence level explodes as he know believe he has two gods behind his back, and that each of his men are worth twenty Ghiscari slave soldiers. No longer his worried or second guessing himself, he is ready to sweep through slaver bay, save his dragon queen, and become king. 

This is also where the writing becomes more choppy (in a good way). Where before every action was described in a painstaking way, now entire scenes are done and over with in a single sentence. 

When he captures the vessel en route to Lys, he offhandedly drowns the perfumed boys because he doesn't like there smell in one sentence. He takes his seven whores and burns them alive in two sentences were he says they were singing with joy. Now these are terrible things but Victarion's delusions are so powerful now everything comes flashing by moment after moment. Where before you were made to seat through the dying screams of his enemies, now its like a face moving poem where everything is symbolic of some great pantheon cheering on the Iron Vessels are they push through the open sea. I read his second chapter quickly rather than my usual slow pace (trying to pick up every clue) and it was actually hysterical, even though the actual things he was doing would amount to crimes against humanity.",asoiaf,"book humor vs show humor [spoilers, main]"
1743,"So, I've had this idea for a while about Cersei's story in TWOW and one way I can see it going is... her going to Dorne?

So, here's the thing, we know Arianne and (f?)Aegon will meet and we know that the latter will at least attempt to sack King's Landing and very likely succeed. Here's how I see it: What if Aegon succeeds and during the sack Tommen dies but Cersei survives and her insanity goes up since her prophecy is one step closer to fruition? Imo, if she survives, she will go not to Casterly Rock but to Dorne, where Myrcella - her last surviving child - is and where once she arrives, Areo will somehow die (I predict this will happen in the middle-ish of the book, and Areo will have finished his mission with Darkstar no matter what the outcome is but I will not tell with certainty how he will die) since we'll have 2 POVs in the same place. Now, I don't know how Cersei will end up to Dorne and how Areo will die but is this something you see happening?

1745,"Roose is, without a doubt, one of the most intriguing characters in ASOIAF. Soft-spoken, yet downright terrifying, a master strategist that used the... questionable decisions of his Stark suzerains to turn the situation in the North to his favour. He became the Warden of the North and rid himself of his House's traditional arch-enemies in a series of masterfully though out manoeuvres. Yet, one can't help but wonder about his motivations, and his long term plans.

In ADWD, he tells Theon:

&gt; ""If she pops out sons the way she pops in tarts, the Dreadfort will soon be overrun with Boltons. Ramsay will kill them all, of course. That's for the best. I will not live long enough to see new sons to manhood, and boy lords are the bane of any House. Walda will grieve to see them die, though.""

Knowing his opinion on Ramsay isn't exactly high, to say the least, it certainly seems to me that he is aware of the inevitability that his House is going to face its doom, sooner or later. He doesn't expect to see any of his potential sons grow up, though he is only ""well past forty"" (not exactly young by Westerosi standards, yet not a venerable old man either). 
A man as clever and calculated as him surely must understand his current predicament, with half of the Northern lords wanting to see him dead, many of whom are trapped with him inside Winterfell, awaiting the battle that is to come. 

Barbrey Dustin says:

&gt; ""I think he would be pleased if the fat man attempted some betrayal. **It would amuse him**. Roose has no feelings, you see. Those leeches that he loves so well sucked all the passions out of him years ago. He does not love, he does not hate, he does not grieve. **This is a game to him**, mildly diverting. Some men hunt, some hawk, some tumble dice. Roose plays with men. You and me, these Freys, Lord Manderly, his plump new wife, even his bastard, **we are but his playthings**.""

So, I guess my question is - did Roose just execute a Palpatine-level master plan solely for shits and giggles? If not, what are your thoughts on his endgame, what does he expect to achieve for himself/his House? All of this almost makes me think that no human could be that cold in the face of certain doom... but mayhaps there's more to Lord *Bolt-on* than meets the eye.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Main] Roose Bolton's endgame

*The Kindly Man:*

&gt;Our forebears came from half a hundred lands, to this place of refuge, to escape the dragon lords, who had enslaved them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Half a hundred gods came with them, but there is one god, all of whom shared in common.

*Cat of the Canals:*

&gt;Him of Many Faces.

*The Kindly Man:*

&gt;And many names.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Qohor he is the Black Goat, in Yi Ti the Lion of Night, in Westeros the Stranger. All men must bow to him in the end. No matter if they worship the Seven, or the Lord of Light, the Moon Mother, or the Drowned God, or the Great Shepard. All mankind belongs to him.

&gt;**Else, somewhere in the world, would be a folk who live forever.**

&gt;**Do you know of any folk who live forever?**

*Cat of the Canals:*

&gt;No. All men must die.

So the question I put forth to you,

**Can the Others live forever?**

In the books we know little and less about the Others, as many tales as there are gods. However, in the show (which I do not believe is any sort of font of truth) the Night King at least lived for over 8000 years.

This question had one of those weights that George likes to give his best foreshadowing, and it struck me that it could be some hint for several characters, but the idea of him asking about a ""folk"" who can liver forever, not a singular person, made me think of the Others.

There are several interesting people to talk about of course. Does Euron intend to live forever? Can servants of the Lord of Light live forever (Lady Melisandre is said to be many hundreds of years old. According to the show, which will have some truths unfortunately). Can servants of the Many Faced God.

1755,"
&gt;The DANCE timeline alone is a bitch and a half. -GRRM

It's well known GRRM constantly revises the timeline of some chapters. For instance, *Mercy* and ADWD Dany IX were intended to be after the five year gap. GRRM wrote three visions of Quentyn's arrival: long before Dany's marriage, after her marriage, and a day before the wedding. Here I will present five more examples to help us see how he shifted the timeline when revising a chapter.

#ADWD Jon I

GRRM released a preview on his blog in 2008. [Compare it with the published one](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16KDd6TULjlUdFobiHJ4lFJJYFYtLDGjf/view?usp=sharing), we can find a few interesting changes.

* In general, the published version is more concise. As GRRM put it:

&gt;That's a technique I learned in Hollywood, where my scripts were always too long. ""This is too long,"" the studio would say. ""Trim it by eight pages."" But I hated to lose any good stuff -- scenes, dialogue exchanges, bits of action -- so instead I would go through the script trimming and tightening line by line and word by word, cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle. I found the process so valuable that I've done the same with all my books since leaving LA. It's the last stage of the process. Finish the book, then go through it, cutting, cutting, cutting. It produces a tighter, stronger text, I feel. In the case of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, my sweat -- most of it performed after we announced the book's publication date but before I delivered the final chapters -- brought the page count down almost eighty pages all by itself. -[May 2011](https://grrm.livejournal.com/217066.html)

* Thus it's notable GRRM added three sentences: 

&gt;Having a steward fetch and serve for him still felt strange; not long ago, it would have been him fetching breakfast for Lord Commander Mormont.

&gt;In time, no doubt, he would need larger quarters, but for the moment these would serve whilst he accustomed himself to command.

&gt;There were mornings when Jon Snow did not quite believe it himself, when he woke up thinking surely this was some mad dream. It's like putting on new clothes, Sam had told him. The fit feels strange at first, but once you've worn them for a while you get to feeling comfortable.

Apparently, GRRM added these words to made it more convincing that Jon was just elected as Lord Commander. In fact, according to /u/BryndenBFish 's [research](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9q3bfe/spoilers_twow_grrms_adwdtwow_writing_timeline_it/), this chapter was first written in 2001, back when GRRM still planned the 5 year gap. 

#AFFC Jaime II

[GRRM read this chapter at a con in 2004.](https://www.labarriera.net/forum/index.php?/topic/2856-nuovo-capitolo-di-jaime-riassunto/) The first half is sending Tywin's body to the Rock (same as published Jaime II), the second half is Tommen's marriage and burning Tower of the Hand from Jaime's POV. The Italian reporter said this chapter was originally a Cersei chapter. (Sadly the 2004 English discussion thread for this chapter was lost, we only got a [backup in 2005](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/asoiaf/jaime-ii-spoilers-for-affc-t577.html). So idk how they knew it was originally a Cersei chapter.)

In the published version, we first view Tommen's marriage and burning Tower of the Hand from Cersei's POV (Cersei III). Then sending away Tywin's body from Jaime's POV (Jaime II). So GRRM not only changed the sequence of the two chapters, he also changed the POV.

More interestingly, in the [2003 partial draft](https://i.imgur.com/9hSJ00a.jpg) GRRM sent to the editor, Cersei III took place before Jaime II, the same as what we see in published book. My guess is, back in 2003, Cersei III and Jaime II were pretty similar to what we see today. But in 2004, when GRRM found AFFC manuscript was to thick for a single volume, he started to cut materials and combine chapters. The ""Jaime II"" he read in 2004 was in fact a combination of Cersei III and Jaime II. (Thus the Italian reporter said this chapter was originally a Cersei chapter.) Then in 2005 when it's decided to split the book, he returned to the old way and made them separate again.

#ADWD Jon III &amp; IV

[GRRM read it at a con in 2003](http://asoiaf.narod.ru/files/Spoiler_Jon_Snow_PoV.htm). In the earlier form, everyone was afraid of Tywin. No one knew he's dead. But in the published version, Jon learned Tywin's death. Presumably many characters' reaction would be modified too.

#ADWD Jon II

[GRRM first read it at a con in 2008](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/27418-pre-adwd-spoilers-jon-3-but-actually-jon-1/), where Janos Slynt said ""I have friends, if Tywin Lannister were alive you would never..."" But GRRM kind of forgot in AFFC Samwell I, which happened at the same time and was published 3 years ago, no one knew Tywin was dead. When he read it again [5 days later](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/27418-pre-adwd-spoilers-jon-3-but-actually-jon-1/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=1302732):

&gt;It was changed from ""If Lord Tywin was still alive"" to ""When Lord Tywin hears of this...""I did startle George a bit during the signing when I told him ""I noticed you changed what Slynt said right before he was hanged..."" That was fun :) ""How do you know what I changed?!?"" he asked incredulously, after a slight, bewildered pause. ""Little birds"".)

#AFFC Queenmaker

There is a mistake in the published version, when Arianne talked with Darkstar, she said: 

&gt;""The lion's dead. Who knows which cub the lioness prefers?""

but later she was shocked to learn from Arys Oakheart that Tywin Lannister just died, which suggests in the earlier draft, this chapter probably happened some time later.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) How GRRM rewrites: chapter timeline shifting
1758,"In [chapter 32 of AGOT](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_32) (Arya chapter), Arya overhears two men near a well in the cellar.  One speaks with the thick accent of the free cities, and one is fat with a scarred face who arya finds oddly familiar.  

I finished ""AGOT"" and am a quarter way through a clash of kings.  Was I supposed to pick up on who these two men are at this point?  Wondering if I was supposed to have pieced it together by now.

1761,"So, I am on my third reread of books 1-5 and I have just finished AFFC for the fourth time. On my first and second read through I enjoyed the book but shared the opinions of most people on here that it was not as good as the previous three. 

But I have to say, the third time through it was so much more interesting to me. I thought that was a one time thing and even had a slight (very slight) dread when I picked it up this time but MAN IS IT GOOD!

Maybe it’s because it’s so much easier to follow now that I know so much more of Martin’s world and history. I know it does not have the action of the other books but it is so rich with character development. 

Of course when I was reading AGOT never in my wildest dreams would I ever think that Jamie would become one of my favorite characters. In Clash and Swords his character was developed significantly but not until Feast do you realize how vulnerable he is. “She’s been fucking Lancel and Osmond Kettleblack and Moon Boy, for all I know.” This shit hits Jamie HARD. He thinks about it all the time. This is a man who literally never lets his vulnerability show. He trash talks knights that he knows could slice through his crippled ass and they do nothing. They are so scared of what he was that even crippled they wouldn’t dare. Jamie has major balls but his vulnerability with Cersei...he loves who she was so much but can’t love who she has become. Meanwhile, they are brother and sister and it’s twisted but here I am sympathizing with the Kingslayer!

And Cersei’s chapters are works of art. The first time I read the AFFC obviously I thought she was a nutbar but not until recently did I realize how diluted she is. It wasn’t easy to see at first because it’s her POV and she thinks she’s a genius, but her plot to frame Margery is just crazy. “It’s hard work to rule a kingdom.” I think that’s the line anyway. Diluted nutbar. And allowing the faith to arm?? She doesn’t even think about why they were disarmed in the first place. And when she asked the High Septon’s leave to take Ser Osney back to the Red Keep and he just says, “no.” Amazing! And how about Kevan telling her off earlier in the book? Great stuff. 

Then you have the Brienne chapters and you get to see how Westeros has just suffered beyond suffering while the high lords play their game of thrones. And you get more development of Brienne as well. The contest between Ser Hyle and the other knights, her father bringing her suitors when she was younger for them to just refuse her...and Lord Tarly’s straight up sexiest approach that it was all her fault and she is a distraction to his men. 

This post is long enough but Sam and Arya have great chapters as well. 

And finally the cyclical nature of the book starting with the murder of Pate and ending with the new Pate (Jaqan). 

It all adds up to Feast being my new favorite. If you haven’t read it a few times do yourself a favor and read it again!",asoiaf,(Spoilers extended) AFFC keeps getting better
1763," 

So, I finished the books for the first time 2-3 days ago, and when I read this text from aDwD, it gave me the impression that Danaerys actually miscarried because she can remember it not being that long ago that she had her previous moon blood. I think the poisonous berries made her miscarry. Or is it the berries making her hallucinate the last time she got it because she's confused about the passage of time from the poison? I know this has probably been asked a million times, but I'm new to the books and to this reddit thread, and I want to hear your opinions on it as well. Here's the text:

&gt;**When** **she** **woke**, **gasping**, **her** **thighs** **were** **slick** with **blood**.  
For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I'm so tired. She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep. Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass, and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.  
If she had not been so sick and scared, that might have come as a relief. Instead she began to shiver violently. She rubbed her fingers through the dirt, and grabbed a handful of grass to wipe between her legs. The dragon does not weep. She was bleeding, but it was only woman's blood. **The moon is still a crescent, though. How can that be? She tried to remember the last time she had bled. The last full moon? The one before? The one before that? No, it cannot have been so long as that.** ""I am the blood of the dragon,"" she told the grass, aloud.",asoiaf,"[Spoilers main] A question about Danaerys's last chapter in aDwD (reposted because the last post contained spoilers in the title, woops!)"
1764,"Moving on from Houses Martell and Tyrell that I've discussed previously, this week I wanted to discuss everyone's favourite family of wine drinkers and throne takers and what their final fates will be at the end of ASOIAF - House Lannister.

Throughout ASOIAF, the Lannisters have continued to consolidate their power over Westeros and the Iron Throne until the shocking deaths of Joffrey and Tywin in ASOS, followed then by Tyrion's exile and Cersei's humiliating Walk of Shame. Tywin Lannister's great legacy is now being threatened following his passing and his children have all turned on each other, with their control and influence over Westeros waning. With fAegon and Daenerys eyeing the Iron Throne and the Others marching south, things don't look particularly good for the Lannisters. 

So with all that in mind, what are your predictions for the endgame fate of House Lannister by the end of ASOIAF and its main members? Here are my predictions below;

* **Cersei Lannister**

Of all the POV characters, I am the most convinced that Cersei Lannister will definitely die in TWOW. I really enjoy and believe in the fan theories that Cersei is both pregnant and will have to have her left foot amputated after it was infected during her Walk of Shame, which will symbolise the severed connection between her and Jaime and also prevent her from leaving King's Landing when fAegon invades. 

I believe that Cersei will win her upcoming Trial by Combat with the Faith thanks to Ser Robert Strong but during the battle his helm will be knocked off and expose him as the undead Gregor Clegane. The Faith will declare necromancy as a perversion of their religion and the Sand Snakes in King's Landing will feel cheated when they were previously told that the Mountain was dead. In response, they'll kill Tommen by poisoning Ser Pounce who'll then bite him and the Sand Snakes will be killed for his murder.

I believe then Cersei will try to hold on to the throne by making Qyburn keep Tommen alive despite being poisoned just as he did with Gregor Clegane through necromancy while fAegon and his forces mobilise on King's Landing. Eventually, the Dornish Army will seek entry into the city and Cersei will grant it from Qyburn's urging as he calls them friends of the crown for wanting to take the throne through Myrcella (Paralleling Pycelle urging Aerys to let the Lannisters in). The Dornish will then sack the city under Jon Con's orders and Cersei will be dethroned. 

From here, this is where my tinfoil comes in. I recently argued in a post that Sansa will be the Queen who casts Cersei down and takes from her all that she holds dear, and she will be fAegon's Queen who counsels him to spare her and sentence her to the black cells until her child is born. Cersei will then be left to languish in the cells in grief upon learning the deaths of Jaime, Myrcella, contemplating what she did to Tommen, most likely give premature birth (Double cruelty if its to a dwarf baby) and then I believe the Valonquar will be...UnTommen. For years I believed it would be Jaime, then more recently Tyrion but now I believe it will be Tommen. Maggy the Frog's comments about the Valonquar came directly after discussing the fate of Cersei's children and I think Cersei being killed by her son is the most tragic and devastating for her character.

This is George we're talking about, I can totally see him killing Cersei off in her own POV chapter after giving birth to a still-born dwarf at the hands of her undead son a couple of chapters after losing one of her feet. 

* **Jaime Lannister**

For a long time I've been on the hype train that Jaime Lannister would have a more heroic or redeeming ending in ASOIAF, either dying fighting against the Others, saving Sansa or crowning Jon but now I've come to the conclusion that he too will also die in TWOW. In thinking about his upcoming confrontation with Lady Stoneheart, I just can't see any logical reason why she would let him live - sure he hasn't broken any of his vows to her in not raising arms against her family but he hasn't saved either of her daughters or brought them home. Instead, he now wields a sword forged from Lady Stoneheart's dead husband's former sword, threatened to kill her newborn nephew, now sending her brother and daughter-in-law to Casterly Rock as hostages and has helped win the war in the Riverlands. The last words Lady Stoneheart heard before she was killed were 'Jaime Lannister sends his regards' and to me thats going to come back to haunt Jaime. I just can't see anything that will deter Stoneheart from wanting to kill Jaime, anything that would stop her believing that he wasn't involved in the Red Wedding or anything to believe that only he can save one of her two daughters. 

So in short, I think Lady Stoneheart is going to execute Jaime in the next book and this is why Qyburn reported to Cersei in ADWD that Jaime hasn't been seen for weeks since going missing. I don't think he's going to turn on his family and help cause another Red Wedding for Stoneheart, declare someone else King that isn't his son Tommen and don't think he'll live up to the Others' invasion. 

* **Tyrion Lannister**

I think George confirmed that Tyrion would live to ADOS and I personally think he's the only one of Tywin's children who will survive the series. I follow the theory that the Sailor's Wife in Braavos is Tysha and her daughter Lanna is also Tyrion's daughter; this revelation will change Tyrion's outlook on life and bring him back from his nihilistic desire to destroy his family and everyone else along with them. I believe this will also be what causes him to abandon Daenerys once he realises how destructive she is, how there won't be any hope of peace under her rule and how he worries for his daughter's future with Daenerys as Queen. So I believe Tyrion will eventually abandon Daenerys, try to support fAegon in holding the throne against her until he is killed and then help the Starks in rebelling against Daenerys until she is killed. 

After that, I think Tyrion is going to take the black so that his daughter can lawfully rule Casterly Rock and he can give her a better life that he failed to do beforehand as a father. I don't think he's going to end up as Hand of the King or Lord of Casterly Rock like in the show given Tyrion killed his father and is believed to have killed his nephew King Joffrey as well - he's committed too many crimes for Westeros to forgive and I think Tyrion will take the black to get away from it all. 

* **Tommen Baratheon**

As I mentioned above, I believe that Tommen will die early on in TWOW and be poisoned by the Sand Snakes in King's Landing upon discovering that Gregor Clegane is somewhat still alive, through poisoning his cat Ser Pounce and then waiting for the cat to bite and infect Tommen. After that, I believe he will 'die' like Gregor Clegane did in Qyburn's dungeon but be brought back as UnTommen in a similar state to Ser Robert Strong, which Cersei will do believing that she can cheat her way out of Maggy the Frog's prophecy and keep Tommen alive so that she can cling on to power through him. However, I believe Qyburn is a Dornish agent who will turn on Cersei after the Dornish invade and once she is imprisoned in the dark cells, I believe Qyburn will command UnTommen to kill his mother, then UnTommen will be mercy killed shortly afterwards. 

* **Myrcella Baratheon**

I believe Myrcella will also be poisoned to death about half-way into TWOW by the Sand Snakes in Dorne in retribution for the deaths of their sisters in King's Landing. As mentioned before, I believe that the Sand Snakes in King's Landing will poison Tommen and once that is discovered, Cersei will have them executed. In retaliation, I believe that the Sand Snakes in Dorne will grow tired of Doran's indecisiveness, kill him and take over through Arianne, then poison Myrcella to death. I believe that all three of Cersei's children will have been poisoned to death by Oberyn Martell and his children in retribution for all that her family has wrought upon his family (My headcanon is that Oberyn planned on poisoning Tyrion at the Red Wedding but accidentally and unwittingly poisoned Joffrey to death).

1766,"According to some sources, Bloodraven took Dark Sister to the wall when he went. Presumably he took it when he went north of the wall as well - so it stands to reason that it might currently be in the cave with the group.

1768,"*Catelyn III*, **A Clash of Kings**

Is this an accurate thing for Catelyn to say? It's good for a cheap laugh, but I whole-heartedly disagree with it. It seems after reading through the series that the King is remarkably merciful, even to those who would otherwise would be put to the sword for openly rebelling against him. Can anyone point to examples of Stannis being notoriously without mercy? And I'm not talking about the execution of heinous criminals or people like Alester Florent who openly plotted treason and sedition against him.",asoiaf,"“I am not without mercy,” thundered he who was notoriously without mercy. (Spoilers Extended)"
1774,"Here are the potential candidates I think could be Cersei's valonquar.

1. Tyrion- I feel like its too obvious for this to be the choice but its still 100% possible because he has thousands of reasons to kill her. 
2. Jaime- I think this is the more likely choice. I think it would be fitting for his character and GRRM likes to repeat history in his lore a lot. Kingslayer and now Queenslayer. It would also be really satisfying if he chooses to kill Cersei over Brienne or something like that.
3. Arya- She was mistaken a lot to be a boy. She's also training to become an assassin and her story hasn't affected the plot of other characters too much and I feel like this is just building up for her to have some huge moment. She still has the list of names and Cersei is still on it. Her story is open ended enough for her to assassinate someone else though so I would say the least likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my potential candidates I think could be the more beautiful one to cast her down:

1. Margaery- I feel like Margaery is a red herring but what if she is like a double red herring. Like GRRM put her in there for us to think that she's obviously a red herring for Dany to come in but turns out it actually is Margaery in the end. Not likely imo though.
2. Dany- I feel like its too obvious but there's also so much that can be done for Dany's character in this situation that I still think its probably gonna be it.
3. Sansa- Seems fitting. No real explanation tbh but its gonna be in a dirty way as she beats Cersei at her own game, kind of like the student defeating the teacher.
4. Myrcella- I think this would be a really cool twist but I'm 90% she's gonna die.
5. Brienne- Super unlikely but I thought it would be a nice parallel to Jaime's story with him as the Kingslayer and her as the Queenslayer. Also it could be like an inner beauty type of think idk.

&amp;#x200B;

How Will Tommen and Mycrella die????:

1. Tommen- I really loved the show ending for him but in the books he's way too young. No matter what his death is its definitely gonna be really sad because he is just a sweet young innocent boy. Maybe this whole High Sparrow thing pisses the Tyrells off and they see that Tommen is too weak to sit on the Iron Throne so they cast him down??? Seems unlikely but possible.
2. Myrcella- I feel like she is gonna marry fAegon and Cersei is gonna have to choose between saving Tommen or Myrcella but Cersei is already kind of going mad so she believes that Myrcella is the younger and more beautiful one to cast her down so she sides with Tommen which ends in Mycrella's death. Or maybe Tommen dies so she becomes the actual Queen but then Myrcella marries fAegon and Cersei must fight her for the Iron Throne. It'll also fit the ""gold will be their shrouds"" as she died because she was Queen.

1776,"Jaime before Roberts Rebellion was a pretty honourable guy yeah even though he was a inexperienced guy who he was actually a good kid. After Jaime killed Aerys he faced a lot judgement and just put a wall around him and was like fuck people already think I’m a bad guy and no matter how much good I do I’ll still be the kingslayer so I might as well just be a dick. Then Jaime meets Brienne and gets his hand cut off, Brienne definitely reminded Jaime of his young self and other young knights so he changes he goes back to old Jaime only difference he’s a lot less arrogant then young Jaime who was at the time Tywin Lannister’s heir, knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne and the youngest member of the kingsguard.

**Dragonrider**

Since it seems that one must have valyrian blood in order to ride valyrian dragons, one option is that any character in the series who is currently [alive and has valyrian blood](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/f2v6de/the_blood_of_old_valyria_part_i_list_of_current/) is a possible candidate to ride one of them (as we see with Quentyn and Alyn Hull/Velaryon it is a prerequisite but not a guarantee), it is possible that any character currently in/coming to the area could ride either of them back.

&gt;**Even for a son of House Targaryen, there are always dangers in approaching a strange dragon**, particularly an old, bad-tempered dragon who has recently lost her rider. His father and mother would never allow him to go near Vhagar, Aemond knew. So he made certain they did not know, sliding from his bed at dawn whilst they still slept and stealing down to the great outer yard where Vhagar and the other dragons were fed and stabled. The prince had hoped to mount Vhagar in secrecy, but as he crept up to the dragon a boy’s voice rang out. “You stay away from her!”

Characters in/near Meereen that have Valyrian blood:

- **Brown Ben Plumm** (two drops of dragon blood in his [ancestry](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/fp1za4/something_interesting_regarding_brown_ben_plumms/) and Viserion is already quite fond of him)

&gt;Her captains bowed and left her with her handmaids and her dragons. But as Brown Ben was leaving, **Viserion spread his pale white wings and flapped lazily at his head. One of the wings buffeted the sellsword in his face. The white dragon landed awkwardly with one foot on the man's head and one on his shoulder, shrieked, and flew off again. ""He likes you, Ben,"" said Dany.**

&gt;""And well he might."" Brown Ben laughed. ""I have me a drop of the dragon blood myself, you know."" - ASOS, Daenerys V

- **The Tattered Prince** 

He is probably just as unlikely as Tyrion to have Valyrian Blood. But the commander of the [Windblown](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/cujh6s/hiding_amongst_the_windblown_spoilers_extended/) (this post looks at the identities of each member of the company) is not only from Pentos but also:

&gt;**Even the commander of the Windblown kept his true name to himself.** Some free companies had been born during the century of blood and chaos that had followed the Doom of Valyria. Others had been formed yesterday and would be gone upon the morrow. The Windblown went back thirty years, and had known but one commander, the soft-spoken, sad-eyed Pentoshi nobleman called the Tattered Prince. His hair and mail were silver-grey, but his ragged cloak was made of twists of cloth of many colors, blue and grey and purple, red and gold and green, magenta and vermilion and cerulean, all faded by the sun. When the Tattered Prince was three-and-twenty, as Dick Straw told the story, the magisters of Pentos had chosen him to be their new prince, hours after beheading their old prince. Instead he'd buckled on a sword, mounted his favorite horse, and fled to the Disputed Lands, never to return. He had ridden with the Second Sons, the Iron Shields, and the Maiden's Men, then joined with five brothers-in-arms to form the Windblown. Of those six founders, only he survived. -ADWD, The Windblown

Does that line mean anything? Probably not, but it still sticks out to me. 

- **Tyrion** (I don't think he does have valyrian blood, but its heavily theorized, so I included him for completion's sake)

I would like to note that I think there is a [chance](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ih6083/tyrion_the_dragonrider_spoilers_extended/) that Tyrion does ride a dragon later in the series, but it won't be due to him having valyrian blood.

**Dragonhorn**

It can be argued which horn exactly it is that Euron has, but it is quite possible that the horn will summon a dragon:

&gt;""I know as much of war as you do, Crow's Eye,"" Asha said. ""Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros with dragons.""

&gt;""And so shall we,"" Euron Greyjoy promised. **""That horn you heard I found amongst the smoking ruins that were Valyria, where no man has dared to walk but me. You heard its call, and felt its power. It is a dragon horn, bound with bands of red gold and Valyrian steel graven with enchantments. The dragonlords of old sounded such horns, before the Doom devoured them. With this horn, ironmen, I can bind dragons to my will.""**

&gt;Asha laughed aloud. ""A horn to bind goats to your will would be of more use, Crow's Eye. There are no more dragons.""

&gt;""Again, girl, you are wrong. There are three, and I know where to find them. Surely that is worth a driftwood crown."" -AFFC, The Drowned Man

and:

&gt;""Woe."" The Crow's Eye sipped from his silver cup. ""I once held a [dragon's egg](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bu3fyq/bloodravens_egg_spoilers_extended/) in this hand, brother. This Myrish wizard swore he could hatch it if I gave him a year and all the gold that he required. When I grew bored with his excuses, I slew him. As he watched his entrails sliding through his fingers he said, 'But it has not been a year.'"" He laughed. ""Cragorn's died, you know.""

&gt;""Who?""

&gt;**""The man who blew my dragon horn. When the maester cut him open, his lungs were charred as black as soot.""**

&gt;Victarion shuddered. ""Show me this dragon's egg.""

&gt;""I threw it in the sea during one of my dark moods."" Euron gave a shrug. ""It comes to me that the Reader was not wrong. Too large a fleet could never hold together over such a distance. The voyage is too long, too perilous. Only our finest ships and crews could hope to sail to Slaver's Bay and back. The Iron Fleet."" -AFFC, The Reaver

The horn was as warm and smooth as the dusky woman's thighs, and so shiny that he could see a twisted likeness of his own features in its depths. Strange sorcerous writings had been cut into the bands that girded it. ""Valyrian glyphs,"" Moqorro called them.**

&gt;That much Victarion had known. ""What do they say?""

&gt;**""Much and more."" The black priest pointed to one golden band. ""Here the horn is named. 'I am Dragonbinder,' it says.** Have you ever heard it sound?""

&gt;""Once."" One of his brother's mongrels had sounded the hellhorn at the kingsmoot on Old Wyk. A monster of a man he had been, huge and shaven-headed, with rings of gold and jet and jade around arms thick with muscle, and a great hawk tattooed across his chest. ""The sound it made … it burned, somehow. As if my bones were on fire, searing my flesh from within. Those writings glowed red-hot, then white-hot and painful to look upon. It seemed as if the sound would never end. It was like some long scream. A thousand screams, all melted into one.""

&gt;And the man who blew the horn, what of him?""

&gt;**""He died. There were blisters on his lips, after. His bird was bleeding too."" The captain thumped his chest. ""The hawk, just here. Every feather dripping blood. I heard the man was all burned up inside, but that might just have been some tale.""**

&gt;""A true tale."" **Moqorro turned the hellhorn, examining the queer letters that crawled across a second of the golden bands. ""Here it says, 'No mortal man shall sound me and live.' ""**

&gt;Bitterly Victarion brooded on the treachery of brothers. Euron's gifts are always poisoned. ""The Crow's Eye swore this horn would bind dragons to my will. But how will that serve me if the price is death?""

&gt;""Your brother did not sound the horn himself. Nor must you."" Moqorro pointed to the band of steel. ""Here. **'Blood for fire, fire for blood.' Who blows the hellhorn matters not. The dragons will come to the horn's master. You must claim the horn. With blood.""** -ADWD, Victarion I

We also know that such horns were used by Valyrians:

&gt;She would sooner have returned to Meereen on dragon's wings, to be sure. But that was a desire Drogon did not seem to share.

&gt;**The dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns.** Daenerys made do with a word and a whip. Mounted on the dragon's back, she oft felt as if she were learning to ride all over again. When she whipped her silver mare on her right flank the mare went left, for a horse's first instinct is to flee from danger. When she laid the whip across Drogon's right side he veered right, for a dragon's first instinct is always to attack. Sometimes it did not seem to matter where she struck him, though; sometimes he went where he would and took her with him. Neither whip nor words could turn Drogon if he did not wish to be turned. The whip annoyed him more than it hurt him, she had come to see; his scales had grown harder than horn.

&gt;And no matter how far the dragon flew each day, come nightfall some instinct drew him home to Dragonstone. His home, not mine. Her home was back in Meereen, with her husband and her lover. That was where she belonged, surely. -ADWD, Daenerys X

And Rhaegal seems to be focused on the bay (where the Ironborn/horn are):

&gt;**The green beast was circling above the bay, banking and turning as longships and galleys clashed and burned below him**, but it was the white dragon the sellswords were gawking at. Three hundred yards away the Wicked Sister swung her arm, chunk-THUMP, and six fresh corpses went dancing through the sky. Up they rose, and up, and up. Then two burst into flame. -TWOW, Tyrion I

and:

&gt;By the time Plumm and his companions came galloping back from the camp of the Girl General, the white dragon had flown back to its lair above Meereen. **The green still prowled, soaring in wide circles above the city and the bay on great green wings.** -TWOW, Tyrion I

***

**Daenerys**

Even before Dany and Drogon bonded, her dragons were becoming less and less controllable. I think the bond that has been created between Dany/Drogon could eliminate any lingering control that remains, that said if one or both remain once Dany returns to Meereen, it is possible they just follow her to Westeros.

&gt;""You … you mean to ride them?""

&gt;**""One of them. All I know of dragons is what my brother told me when I was a girl, and some I read in books, but it is said that even Aegon the Conqueror never dared mount Vhagar or Meraxes, nor did his sisters ride Balerion the Black Dread. Dragons live longer than men, some for hundreds of years, so Balerion had other riders after Aegon died … but no rider ever flew two dragons.""**

&gt;Viserion hissed again. Smoke rose between his teeth, and deep down in his throat they could see gold fire churning. -ADWD, Daenerys VIII

***

There exists some other possibilities that exist such as long lost characters with Valyrian blood from characters who disappeared (I listed one in the Tattered Prince, but there are others), one or both dragons dying in Essos before being ridden, someone warging or even Moqorro using [fire magic](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/gic3tp/nettles_and_rhllor_spoilers_extended/), but I think each of these is pretty unlikely.

I think the most likely scenario is that Rhaegal is flown using the dragonhorn and then Viserion is flown by Brown Ben Plumm but I am open to other opinions.

**TLDR: Possible options for how Viserion/Rhaegal get to Westeros**",asoiaf,The Current Riderless Dragons and How They Get to Westeros (Spoilers Extended)
1789,"In the AWOIAF and F&amp;B; the Maesters always said that sunfyre was the most beautiful dragon. I personally don’t find a dragon who’s primary color is gold to be beautiful. Striking, cool and interesting is what I would describe it as but my all time favorite dragon color is Gold as a secondary color. Viserion is my personal favorite dragon because of his pale white body with his golden horns and black teeth. He is literally majestic. His flame is pale mixed with gold. Literally majestic. My second favorite is Meleys, the river of rubies. 

If there was a color that I would have loved to see is on a dragon it would be like iridescent metal. The mix of blue green and purple would look so badass.",asoiaf,(Spoilers main) which is the most beautiful dragon in your opinion
1790,"One reason I think Ramsay is the author because it just makes the most sense and requires the fewest amount of explanations, following Occam’s Razor. I subscribe to the Night Lamp theory and think Stannis wins the Battle of Ice. However, I think he fakes his death as he says: “In Braavos you may hear that I am dead” (Theon I, TWoW). This could be to help the Manderlys prove their loyalty by bringing back Lightbringer as proof of Stannis’ demise, when in reality, Stannis catches Ramsay unawares and takes Winterfell. It also makes sense why he wants Reek (Theon) and Jeyne back. Reek is his torture-toy (Reek also knows it was Ramsay who burned Winterfell, and that the Stark boys are alive) and Jeyne is his source of authority. It also makes sense why he wants Selyse, Shireen, and Melisandre for political hostages. What makes a little less sense is his capture of Mance and demands of his Val and his child, though this could be anger at Mance’s role in freeing Jeyne(?) 

But the ultimate reason why I think it is Ramsay is because it serves more than just as a plot device to lead to Jon’s death—it has emotional value for Jon. It forces Jon to choose between his duty and his family. His oath and his sister. It helps set Ramsay as an enemy to Jon. If the Pink Letter’s author isn’t Ramsay, the emotional impact of Jon’s decision to save Arya and forsake his vows, loses meaning. The twist to the letter doesn’t have to be its author. The twist could very well be that Stannis is still alive, which makes sense: why have a whole book setting up Stannis’ battle to kill him and hold the battle offscreen? George has said that we will see the Battle of Ice in the next book, so if it’s coming in the next book, why spoil the ending in the previous one? Because the ending given to us in the letter is a misleading—Stannis still being alive is the twist of the letter.

TL;DR— Ramsay is imo the author of the PL because it has the emotional impact of choice with Jon and its twist is about Stannis’ fate, not the author.",asoiaf,Why I Think Ramsay Wrote the Pink Letter [Spoilers Extended]
1791,"One often overlooked detail (and its easy to overlook because of the AFFC/ADWD overlap) is that in addition to Marwyn (who is aboard the [*Cinnamon Wind*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ijx4nn/all_aboard_the_journey_of_the_cinnamon_wind/) and got a head start) that there should be representative from the Citadel arriving in Meereen soon as well.

**Thoughts and Theories on the representative the Citadel is sending to Meereen.**

***

We get this quote from Moqorro:

&gt;""Our captain would prefer to be fifty leagues farther out to sea, well away from that accursed shore, but I have commanded him to steer the shortest course. **Others seek Daenerys too.""** 

And while it is more likely referring to the Ironborn and others, it should be noted that the Citadel will be sending their own ""man"" to Meereen:

&gt;""What will you do?"" asked Alleras, the Sphinx.

""Get myself to Slaver's Bay, in Aemon's place. The swan ship that delivered Slayer should serve my needs well enough. **The grey sheep will send their man on a galley, I don't doubt. With fair winds I should reach her first.""**

***

I am assuming that the maesters will hear about about the dragons from Quhuru Mo when he sells them the books he accepted as payment from Sam. So that means that this rep will be leaving relatively soon as well.

So that begs the question: **""Who would the Citadel send?**

***

#Possibilities

**Archmaester Thebold**

The current [Seneschal of the Citadel](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Defender_of_the_Citadel). He stepped up because Walgrave is looney and won the lottery this year. I don't think he is the Perfumed Seneschal but it would fit if he was sent since:

&gt;""If I tell you, they may need to kill you too."" Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth. **""Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?"" He spat. ""The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons**. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can.""

and:

&gt;""Tell them how wise and good they are. Tell them that Aemon commanded you to put yourself into their hands. Tell them that you have always dreamed that one day you might be allowed to wear the chain and serve the greater good, that service is the highest honor, and obedience the highest virtue. **But say nothing of prophecies or dragons, unless you fancy poison in your porridge.""** Marwyn snatched a stained leather cloak off a peg near the door and tied it tight. ""Sphinx, look after this one.""

It is also possible a different archmaester/maester/acolyte could be sent.

***

**Faceless Man**

The ""man"" they send could be a literal Faceless Man, which would make sense due to the fact that both the Faceless Men and Citadel are anti-dragon.

It should be noted there is a faceless man who has infiltrated the citadel and has access to any room, even the fault and this blood soaked tome:

&gt;And of course there was even less chance of his coming on the fragmentary, anonymous, blood-soaked tome sometimes called Blood and Fire and sometimes The Death of Dragons, the only surviving copy of which was supposedly hidden away in a locked vault beneath the Citadel.

They also probably have a [dragon egg](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bu3fyq/bloodravens_egg_spoilers_extended/) as well.

That said, they are extremely expensive:

&gt;Ned bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel Robert's eyes on his back. As he strode from the council chambers, the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause. ""On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men,"" Grand Maester Pycelle offered.

&gt;**""Do you have any idea how costly they are?"" Littlefinger complained. ""You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that's for a merchant. I don't dare think what they might ask for a princess.""** -AGOT, Eddard VIII

***

**Sellswords**

Not sure it would be incredibly smart, but they could also hire sellswords. I posted about the [Fate of the Brave Companions](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b471w6/fate_of_the_brave_companions_spoilers_extended/): 

&gt;Timeon shrugged. ""We all went our own ways, after we left Harrenhal. **Urswyck and his lot rode south for Oldtown**. Rorge thought he might slip out at Saltpans. Me and my lads made for Maidenpool, but we couldn't get near a ship."" The Dornishman hefted his spear. ""You did for Vargo with that bite, you know. His ear turned black and started leaking pus. Rorge and Urswyck were for leaving, but the Goat says we got to hold his castle. Lord of Harrenhal, he says he is, no one was going to take it off him. He said it slobbery, the way he always talked. We heard the Mountain killed him piece by piece. A hand one day, a foot the next, lopped off neat and clean. They bandaged up the stumps so Hoat didn't die. He was saving his cock for last, but some bird called him to King's Landing, so he finished it and rode off."" -AFFC, Brienne IV 

So its possible they hire sellswords, but not likely imo.

***

**The Hightowers**

Leyton Hightower hasn't left the High Tower in decade. He is currently ~~consulting spells~~[using his glass candle](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ewu050/the_man_in_the_high_castle_spoilers_extended/)

It should be noted that the Hightowers founded not only the Starry Sept but also granted the land for the citadel and are a patron of the Citadel. One of the titles of Leyton is [**Defender of the Citadel**](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Defender_of_the_Citadel)

So while its obviously not Leyton who has gone there are a couple other possibilities. He has 4 sons:

&gt;""To be sure. Lord Leyton's locked atop his tower with the Mad Maid, consulting books of spells. Might be he'll raise an army from the deeps. Or not. Baelor's building galleys, Gunthor has charge of the harbor, Garth is training new recruits, and **Humfrey's gone to Lys to hire sellsails.** If he can winkle a proper fleet out of his whore of a sister, we can start paying back the ironmen with some of their own coin. Till then, the best we can do is guard the sound and wait for the bitch queen in King's Landing to let Lord Paxter off his leash."" -AFFC, Samwell V

Since Gunthor studied for years at the Citadel it would have been cool if he was the one sent to Lys, but its Humfrey who is sent to talk to Lynesse and I know this doesn't mean anything but still fun:

&gt;She gave him leave to go, but as he was lifting the flap of her tent, she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question. **""What did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?""**

&gt;Ser Jorah smiled sadly. **""Why, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys.""**

and then the more fun option...

Leyton/Malora use a glass candle. As I mentioned upthread, I quite confident that Leyton has one and its probably one of the [four candles](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/h7k46h/the_four_glass_candles_spoilers_extended/) that were brought to Oldtown from Valyria. Leyton/Malora could use it to start contacting Dany:

&gt;""What feeds a dragon's fire?"" Marwyn seated himself upon a stool. ""All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood or fire. **The sorcerers of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and deserts with one of these glass candles. They could enter a man's dreams and give him visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before their candles.** Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?"" -AFFC, Samwell V

Unless they already have been:

&gt;Dany rose from the pool. Water trickled down her legs, and gooseflesh covered her arms in the cool night air. ""If you have some warning for me, speak plainly. What do you want of me, Quaithe?""

&gt;**Moonlight shone in the woman's eyes. ""To show you the way.""**

and:

&gt;The arms of House Hightower show a stepped white tower crowned with fire on a smoke-grey field. The House words are **We Light the Way**. -AFFC, Appendix

Outside of Shiera Seastar, Malora ""the Mad Maid"" Hightower is my next best guess as to who Quaithe is, so its possible that they are already in contact with Dany.

***

**Just some guy**

It could be just that this is a small detail that won't matter. They could be sending someone and it have no further bearing on the plot.

That said AFFC, Samwell V takes place months before the current point in the story. That means that as the Battle of Fire takes place Marwyn aboard the *Cinnamon Wind* and the grey rat's rep are at least deep into their travels, if not already getting close to Meereen.

***

**Haldon Halfmaester**

Its possible that the Citadel already sent their guy as well. He just turned around.

&gt;""That was how it was with Lord Rickard Stark. Maester Walys was his grey rat's name. And isn't it clever how the maesters go by only one name, even those who had two when they first arrived at the Citadel? That way we cannot know who they truly are or where they come from … but if you are dogged enough, you can still find out. Before he forged his chain, Maester Walys had been known as Walys Flowers. Flowers, Hill, Rivers, Snow … we give such names to baseborn children to mark them for what they are, but they are always quick to shed them. **Walys Flowers had a Hightower girl for a mother … and an archmaester of the Citadel for a father, it was rumored.** The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all. Once he forged his chain, his secret father and his friends wasted no time dispatching him to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard's ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey. The Tully marriage was his notion, never doubt it, he— -ADWD, The Prince of Winterfell

I readily admit this could be an inconsequential detail in the series, but I thought it would be interesting to look into. Let me know which example fits best or any other good examples you can come up with.

1792,"&amp;#x200B;

One of the mysteries that I am most curious about is what Rhaegar read that made him change his mind. ( and will probably remain unresolved) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault. He  was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed  some books and a candle whilst he was in her womb. Rhaegar took  no interest in the play of other children. The maesters were awed by his  wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the  Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found  something in his scrolls that changed him. No one knows what it might  have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the  yard as the knights were donning their steel. He walked up to Ser Willem  Darry, the master-at-arms, and said, 'I will require sword and armor.  It seems I must be a warrior.'""

ASOS - Daenerys I We assume that he read about The Prince who was Promised and because that is what Aemon says in this passage 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""No one ever looked for a girl,"" he said. ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar,  I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on  the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died.  He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded  that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been  seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar  was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were,  who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. 

AFFC - Sam IV

&amp;#x200B;

We also know that The Ghost of High Heart predicted that TPTWP would be born of Aegon's lineage, but she didn't write anything, and from what is implied she spoke of a prophecy that was already known by the Targaryens. This is where my theory comes in...A book of prophecies, written in Valyrian and in possession of the Targaryens can only be Sings and Portents by Daenys the Dreamer. and there is another character who comes to the same conclusion as Aemon who happened to be in contact with that same book. Marwin the Mage.

1802," Most Lords of Westeros and some in Essos use other people to do their dirty work. The mad dogs are not just usual Lieutenants or captains, they are violent, psychopaths, cruel that enjoy exhorting violence into others. They tend to not be especially intelligent and be deeply loyal to their liege lords. Examples of a normal second in command are Randyll Tarly to Mace Tyrell or Kevan to Tywin.

Mad dogs tend to take many different forms. They may be outriders and form forging parties, this does not mean all outriders are Mad Dogs Brynedn Tully or Adam Marbrand are examples of good honourable outriders. They may be in many cases Bodyguards and/or captains of their Lords Guard, the line between a bodyguard and a Mad Dog may be a little bit fuzzy they may have never acted like one, but their presence imparts fear in the Lord’s enemies. 

It has several Logical reasons why it is better to make another man make your war crimes for you:

* They provide plausible deniability for all the violence they commit pretending to do not know about the specifics. Like when Tywin denies giving the order to rape and kill Elia. 
* The High Lords do not want to be seen like madman psychos they want to be seen as cruel only when necessary. The Mad Dogs are the physical embodiment of the punishment. Tywin will not personally kill Rhaegar children he will just unleash Gregore and Amory Lorch. In Tywin words “Some tasks are fit for lions, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs”
* Like I already say they are a form of Psychological war like Tywin puts it about The Mountain. “No other knight in the realm inspires such terror in our enemies”
* They also are very disposable or at least they should be.

Some Characters that use Mad Dogs in the Current story as well as Historically are:

* Tywin: He is the best exponent of this method; he uses two of his knights and a sellsword company to forge the Riverlands and start a massive industry of destroying the Riverlands in the War of the Five Kings.
   * Ser Amory Lorch: He is the oldest Mad Dog of Tywin using him to kill the last Lord Tarbeck that was only six years old. He also Kills Rhaneyra in the sack of King’s Landing, helps burn the Riverlands, and is named Castellan of Harrenahal. He is eaten by a bear of the Bloody mummers when they turncloak. 
   * Vargo Hoat leader of the Bloody Murmurs: The bloody mummers are a sellsword company of Essos so brutal and unloyal that they didn’t find any job in Essos. They were brought by Tywin which proves that he was preparing for the war long before it started, and he probably knew their modus operandi so he probably brought them just for that. They are an excellent case of plausible deniability considering how racist Westerosi are towards foreigners; they could blame all the war crimes just on them.
   * Ser Gregor Clegane: He is the ultimate Mad Dog great fighter with a group of men just as cruel as him under his orders. He is used in the sack of King’s Landing where he commits several war crimes and in the war of the Five Kings. Because of the killing Elia Martell at the sack that Tyrion offers his head to Doran in exchange for Dorne’s loyalty. When he says so Tywin didn't want to give the mountain away. I think this is because at that point he had lost all his other MD and he considered that The Mountain will probably be useful in helping to end the BwB and the few rebel remnants in the Riverlands. There is a clear symbol in House Clegane Heraldry showing three hounds that show their role serving the Lannisters. 
* Roose Bolton: He uses Mad Dogs just as Tywin but there is deeper cruelty in him using his son as one. He also hires the Bloody Mummers to take Harrenhal and continue Foraging.
   * Ramsay Snow: He is a cruel bastard and no amount of decrees can change it. He is used by his father to increase his power on the Home front making him marry The Hornwood Widow to increase their power. He also pretends to be Reek to betray Theon and burn Winterfell. When asked about it by Robb and Catelyn, Roose denied all guilt and said he was happy he was dead. 
   * Vargo Hoat: This qohori sun of a bitch turns cloak for the Boltons and is rewarded with Harrenhal. He is brutally killed by The Mountain. He fights the Brotherhood without Banners that are basically the anti-Mad Dogs they are outlaws, but they have a scent of honour and protect the people.
* Tyrion: Being Tywin but small is only logical he also used his own Mad Dogs when serving as Hand of the King.
   * Ser Bronn of the Blackwater: After he fought in his trial, but combat Tyrion hires him and when he is acting Hand, he names him captain of his Guard. Bronn is also used to hire other sellswords that are very useful in general as Mad Dog being used to kill Symon Silver Tongue and serving him as “Bowl o’ Brown”
   * The Clansmen: These proto-wildings are excellent MD only loyal to Tyrion and capable of a lot of violence because of constant segregation in the Vale. Tyrion uses them on several occasions to threaten people including members of the Kingsguard. 
* Cersei/Joffrey: Cersei uses her mad dogs as bodyguards mainly (as well as lovers) and he tends to keep them near her. It is only logical that considering herself Tywin’s heir she will use Mad Dogs as well. Qyburn could be included in this list under the logic that he acts as Cersei’s torturer, but he doesn’t have any martial ability or physical strength. 
   * Sandor Clegane: He mainly acts as Joffrey’s sworn shields, but we know of at least one case in which he was used as a Mad Dog being sent to kill the Butcher’s son Mycah. He has certain characteristics that make him ideal as a Mad Dog: his physical appearance makes him especially scary, his unquestionable loyalty (reflected in his coat of arms) and that being not knighted he has at least, in theory, no moral compass (in reality he has much more honour and is a better knight than his brother or many other knights). There is a great public relation mistake Cersei and Joffrey commit when including him into the Kingsguard and dismissing Barristan. It is not just that Barristan is a living legend that increases the legitimacy of any king, and that Sandor can protect Joffrey without Joining the Kingsguard. Another great problem is that having good knights serving you is just as important as having Mad Dogs; you must be capable of both things. The Kingsguard must fulfill this role of being the best knight in the realm and impulse the idea of chivalry meaning serving the king so including a guy that actively hates knights is stupid.
   * The Kettleblacks (?): the sellswords brothers turn into knights and act as Cersei best minions in King’s Landing. They are used as well as Ser Meryn Trant and Ser Boros Blount (both could be included in this list) to kill the cell guards when Tyrion escapes and one of them is used to kill the High Septon. They rise quite high transforming into Kingsguard members, Lord Commander of the Gold Cloaks, and Tommen’s personal shield.
   * Ser Robert Strong (totally not the zombie mountain): the silent knight, for the time being, is just serving as a spooky bodyguard and will probably be used in the trial but combat. If the show is any guidance Cersei will use him to kill his enemies in the City and extend fear against possible rivals. 
* Jaime: he only participated in two military campaigns the rest of the time serving as a Kingsguard. In his second military campaign, he is wanting to recover some of his honour surrounding himself with more honourable knights (Ser Adam Marbrand or Ser Boniffer Hasty and his Holy Hundred) He even dislikes the Mountain’s men and punishes their crimes. He still surrounds himself with one man that could be considered a mad dog or a Dog at least.
   * Ser Ilyn Payne: Having lost his tongue to the Mad King he served as King’s Justice for years transforming into an avatar of death. He rarely separates from Jaime, but his presence only is enough to make anyone scared of suffering under his services. He accomplishes the psychological part of a Mad Dog as well as being Jaime’s confessor and sparring partner. We do not know how he was before losing his tongue, but I think that he had also been very scared at that time. Knowing Tywin’s love of Mad Dogs, I think the possibility of him being one of his original mad dogs is quite real.
* Dany: Being one of the “good guys” we may be less inclined to see her using the service of mad dogs, but he does in quite a lot of cases.
   * Her bloodriders: They have a deep loyalty to her because of their particular role in Dothraki culture and how they are witness of her accomplishing the birth of dragons. They have a Dothraki moral code that allows them to indulge in some terrible acts if Dany orders them. 
   * Daario Naharis: The outlandish Tyroshi Sellsword commander of the Stromcrows is capable of anything in her name. He is also Dany’s lover and tends to advise her into taking the darkest path of violence killing the great Houses of Meereen. Most sellswords can act as Mad Dogs for the right price but there are certain usually smaller companies that are more useful (the second Sons or the Bloody Mummers). Using a large and more expensive company such as the Golden Company committing only regular brutality seems like a waste of time.  
   * Skahaz mo Kandaq “Shavepate”: Belonging to a smaller Meereen’s House he sees in Dany a possibility of increasing his power and status. Like Daario he advises her into taking a violent path against the great houses. He is commissioned to create a police force in the city to fight the Sons of the Harpy and he oversees torturing the wine seller's daughter. He even calls this police force “Bronze Beast” (maybe a little bit obvious). 
* House Rogare: a curious thing is that we usually do not see historical examples of the use of Mad Dogs. It could be that maesters tend to not write about them and only talk about them serving not so popular people, like our favorite Lysenne House. I am sure Mad Dogs are generally used in Essos, probably slave warriors and sellswords. 
   * Sandoq the Shadow: He is one of my favorite minor characters in Fire and Blood with Larys Strong. He serves as a personal Bodyguard for Larra Rogare and kills several knights during the secret siege of Maegor’s Holdfast. His name is a clear reference to other Mad Dog and Personal bodyguard Sandor Clegane, and they share a lot of physical characteristics: Big; all black armor, quiet and with a softer interior.  There are several cases of pit fighters been use like bodyguards and Mad Dogs, for example, Hizdahr zo Loraq when he becomes King of Meereen, probably because they are some of the scariest, best one-to-one fighters, they are very loyal to their masters and they have less of a moral code. 
* Unwin Peake: The other great example of a historical Mad Dog could only come from the most hateful character in all of Fire and Blood. When he took power at King’s Landing being simultaneously Regent and Hand, he created his one personal guard called the Fingers (nice naming). This group of Essosi Sellswords and former slaves were only loyal to him or at least to his gold.
   * The Fingers in general and Tessario the Tiger in particular: Like most personal guards they were usually kept around Unwin. But we have at least one cause in which he uses them to do his murdering for him. It is implied that Tessario The Tiger or The Thumb, a former Volantin slave that served the political faction of the Tiger (the reason why he had tiger stripes tattooed across his face and back) with Ser Mervyn Flowers helped kill Queen Jaharea Targaryen. This is to allow the king to marry one of Unwin’s daughters.
* Petyr Baelish: Littlefinger does not command lots of swords; he only has Lothor Brune and Old Oswell. We Know by the end of AGOT that he controls the golden Cloaks and Janos is one of his men. The main reason that I doubt to include him is that it isn’t that public, and he doesn’t use them to threaten people. 
   * Janos Slynt: Being the son of a Butcher is a clear metaphor of Janos Role in King’s Landing. He is a corrupt idiot that only keeps his post because he works for Littlefinger, we do not see him being used by him that much but it is clear that he uses him in several chances. He is used by Cersei to kill Robert’s bastard and Janos Slynt  Allar Deem was his mad dog. Like a babushka of Mad Dogs.
* Doran Martell: The Prince of Dorne is probably one of the most cautious schemers in the series and he never really leads an army. This means that his use of Mad Dogs is very unique.
   * Oberyn Martell: Being Doran’s brother he is not a dog having some sort of partnership with him. Oberyn being the “viper” and Doran is the “grass”. Oberyn has a great curriculum earning several links in the citadel learning all about poisons and then he passes his years in exile serving as sellswords. All of this makes him great to fulfill the most dangerous missions for their vengeance to be fulfilled.
   * Areo Hotah: Our camera POV in AFFC belongs to a religious order that is married to their axes and serves with loyalty to their masters, the norvoshi came with Doran’s norvoshi consort. He is very efficient at scaring people and making them less likely to fight against Doran, like how Arys Oakheart feels uneasy near him. We only see one time in which Doran despatch him to end the Queensmaker plot so is likely that he uses him on other occasions to exhort his will especially when Oberyn was not around.
* Rorge-Biter: It is true that Rorge is not a high Lord at all, and that he does not run away from his most violent actions. Considering their back story in which Rorge trained an orphan to fight in the dog pits of Flea Bottom. I think that this duo is what the lord and mad dogs really are if you take away all the titles, political scheming, and hierarchy. There are just to psychos, but one is more stupid and violent than the other, so he is stupidly loyal. The important thing is that they, like most of the people in this list, die an early death which fills me with the hope of all these assholes dyeing. 
* The Dothraki, Ironborn, and The Free Folk do not have mad dogs because in their more violent societies the leader of the group is a mad dog himself and is in that brutality that you earn your power. Mance Ryder for example you could say that Varamyr and Weeper are his mad dogs but The Magnar of Thenn and Tormund is just as brutal as them.

Some that I am not so sure that count as Mad Dogs: 

* The Tattered Prince: The pentoshi sellsword captain uses Merys the Beauty and Caggo Corpsekiller as examples of what they could do to you if you disobey him.
   * Meris the Beaty: A westerosi woman that was kidnap rape and torture by a sellsword company and then he transformed into the torturer of the Windblown.
* Bloodraven: We do not know of any Mad Dogs he used during his time as Hand of the king except maybe his personal guard the Crow’s Teeth, but they do not seem especially violent.
   * Coldhands: the undead brother of the night watch that fulfills the missions Bloodraven is unable to do is a tree. He does commit several brutalities like killing the deserters and giving them food to Bran, but I do not see him as especially violent or that Bloddravne ran away to this violence.
* House Frey: They serve as sort of mad dogs with Roose Bolton to Tywin Lannister making the Red Wedding making Tywin’s hands appear clean of breaking this basic law. 
   * Black Walder: Being the most violent member of the family he kills many people for the great of the house. He is not so loyal to the house itself and wants to rise to be the lord. 
* Mace Tyrell: We do not know of any particular Mad Dogs in the Reach but knowing that the Tyrells are full of shit we might see an example of this in the future.
   * Randyl Tarly: I Know at the beginning I said he was not, but we know he did Mace’s dirty job-killing all the Florents in Bitterbridge. He is not so much a force of chaos that breaks law and order and destroys everything he is more of a force of order very brutal, but he is able to re-establish order at Maidenpool.
* Stannis could have used Salladhor Saan if he had allowed him to attack Claw Isle, but he declined the idea following Davos’ advice.

This prediction was supported by what she saw as extremely strong similarities between the legend of Azor Ahai and Ineluki the Storm King from Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn.

This theory was, of course, very very wrong and more clever than what we actually got. *However,* the similarities between Azor Ahai and the Storm King she points out are extremely strong. They are stronger still when you ignore the show and mix in some content from the books, like the legend of the Bloodstone Emperor, or Euron's potential ritual on ~~Green Angel Tower~~ the Hightower. There's something to the idea that the hero Azor Ahai is in fact inspired by the main *villain* of the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy.

Septa Lemore is a septa and teaches Young Griff about the faith of the seven.

And in Jon Connington’s first chapter The Lost Lord he refers to her as lady Lemore so she could also be a highborn noble. 

I’ve heard that she might be Tyene Sand’s mother as her mother was a septa. The only thing wrong with this is that both Oberyn and Lemore have dark hair while Tyene has blonde hair. 

I’ve also hear that some people think that she is Ashara Dayne but Ashara’s eyes were famously purple and really noticeable while Tyrion doesn’t say much about Lemore’s eyes.

1813," Hi, first post here.

Not sure if this has been discussed before but I had the sudden thought that (if it ever materialises) Bran will be the last POV chapter of a dream of spring, and maybe even of ASOIAF.

Disclaimer: I watched the show but haven’t yet finished the books. However I’ve lurked on these boards for a while as I enjoy the theorising and little details about the characters and world people catch.  
   
First off: The idea of a story coming “full circle”, beginning and ending with the same character is a common storytelling device, and Bran is the first major Pov we are introduced to. Being able to track a young boy who is crippled, learns magic and eventually becomes King (if D&amp;D are to believe and this is still GRR Martin’s plan) shows a real progression in the story, and ties a neat bow on ASOIAF as a whole.

Second: In terms of writing an ending, Bran being able to look into the past and future and getting visions is a great story telling device to cover long passages of time and distance in summary form without breaking immersion in the story, i.e replacing the omniscient narrator that often comes at the end of an epic summarising what happens in the aftermath. His (theoretically advanced) green sight would allow GRR to write decades of time passing without feeling cheap, especially if he becomes overloaded and de-sensitised by the magic as in the show. In late life the passage of time could be blurry to him as the past, present and future happen simultaneously, allowing Martin to write about whenever or whatever he wanted. This could be until the end of winter, the end of his rule, or even until his death. Think how impactful (and “bittersweet”) it would be to discover Bran is the epilogue, and that we truly followed his story from beginning to end. 

Third: He would allow us to check in with many beloved characters through his eyes. As a Stark he has an emotional connection to their point of views (the book was briefly titled “a time for wolves”), and if he is crowned king, it also makes him the perfect character to give insight into the world state of Westeros once the dust has settled, as-well as how it will be ruled moving forward (getting GRR Martin’s more grounded version of Tolkein’s “He ruled wisely and well”). 

Fourth: In terms of style, it could be told as a sort of extended fever dream sequence (a dream of spring!!) which Martin has proved to be very capable with in the past. This would justify him writing in a very stylised manner, with vivid symbolic images, pontifications on the major themes and meaning of the story, giving ASOIAF the poetic ending it deserves. 

This last part is just a mindless idea but I think he might not even have a POV for a large portion of ADOS, as it would build suspense of what is going through his head after his possible transformation, his dehumanisation might carry more emotional weight if seen through other POV’s that care about him. Also GRR generally doesn’t like writing magical characters or ones that give too much away, and omitting his POV for a short while would maintain the surprise of him becoming king at the end (although I’m sure this will be handled MUCH MUCH better than in the show). If this is the case, it would make the reveal of a Bran epilogue even more impactful as we’ve been shut out his mind for a long time. 

Feel free to point out any mistakes I’ve made with evidence from the books, I’m curious to hear what you guys think. And if you don’t think the last chapter will be Bran, whose perspective do you think it will be told from?

**TLDR:** I think Bran will be the last chapter of the series as it brings the story full circle, if he’s king he’s the best choice to portray the fate of the realm and other characters in the aftermath of the climax, and his dream like visions allow for poetic writing and long periods of time to be covered without breaking immersion.",asoiaf,[Spoilers EXTENDED] The final chapter of A Dream of Spring.

As I said before I personally can't really hate someone unless they do something personally to me or just really piss me off (Cersei/Balon). I just reread a Clast of Kings a few days ago and after reading the innkeeper's daughter chapter, I was laughing my ass off because I found it funny, of course, Ser Gregor was a terrible person for it, but I didn't hate him for it, I wasn't even angry or have any emotional response really. A perfect example for me would be the Boltons, I love Ramsay and Roose, even do their terrible people, I don't hate them, Ramsay is just too interesting and Roose is just too badass, another example would be when I see a rapist/murder on the news or something, I don't hate them, I may think they're a terrible person, but I can't really hate them.  And this comes to the question I have to ask today, can you hate a character because of there '' evil ''?",asoiaf,(Spoilers Main)Am I the only one who doesn't '' hate '' the villains of this series?
1816,"Disclaimer: I’m not sure if this theory is common knowledge on here, or if it’s even credible, but here we go. 

I think Lyanna’s abduction by Rhaegar, and subsequently Robert’s Rebellion, was inspired by the events of the Trojan War. 

Menelaus was married to Helen, but then she ran off with Paris to Troy. Menelaus and Agamemnon waged war in response. 

Robert was betrothed to Lyanna, but then she ran off with Rhaegar (to Dorne?). Robert and Ned waged war in response (Yes, I know the Mad King killing Ned’s brother was another major incentive, but this was the primary reason for Robert). 

Obviously there are other parallels too: Lyanna being described as the most beautiful girl in the world—like Helen; the circumstances of Lyanna’s departure with Rhaegar being mostly ambiguous (was it consensual? was she kidnapped?)—like Helen’s departure with Paris.

Technology in the ASOIAF Universe has seemed to progress slower than in our real world; with certain technologies being stagnant for hundreds of years.

1829,"Will 2021 finally be the year we get TWOW after a 10 year wait? After a spate of Not A Blog updates by GRRM, I'm feeling a bit more confident. Specifically, I think it's possible that George has written a full draft of TWOW and is now doing a final round of editing before submitting the book for publication. Before laying out the evidence for this, two caveats: (1) This is pure speculation, and so I could be completely wrong! (2) Even if it's true that George is doing a final edit of the whole book, he could still decide to make major revisions that will take months or years to implement. 

**Evidence that George May Be Doing a Final Round of Editing**

*The Pace of Writing:* 

In a recent [Not A Blog entry](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/06/23/writing-reading-writing/), George talked about how he:

&gt; ""finished a new chapter yesterday, another one three days ago, another one the previous week.""

This is a very fast pace of writing, and suggests to me that George is editing and finalizing existing chapters rather than writing completely new ones. One could object to this argument by pointing out that George said he finished *""new""* chapters, but in the past George has [explicitly clarified](https://grrm.livejournal.com/92848.html) that when he said ""completed three new chapters"" he meant that he finalized chapters that had already been written (to some extent) in the past.

*The Geographic Scope of Characters George Has Been Writing:* 

In the last several Not A Blog posts, George has mentioned that he has been writing characters located in Northern Westeros (Asha and Melisandre); Southern Westeros (Cersei and Areo); Braavos (Arya); and Slaver's Bay (Tyrion, Barristan, and Victarion). If George was still dealing with a Meereenese Knot, Northern Knot, etc,. then we would expect George to be focused specifically on characters located in a specific area as opposed to characters scattered across Westeros and Essos. Therefore, I think it makes more sense that George is going through and editing the chapters one-by-one in the order they'll appear in the completed book.

*Specific Characters George Has Been Writing: Victarion and Arya in Braavos*

It was very interesting when George said in a recent [Not a Blog post](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/08/15/back-in-westeros/) that:

&gt; ""I am spending the days in Westeros with my pals Mel and Sam and Vic and  Ty."" 

The inclusion of ""Vic"" (i.e., Victarion Greyjoy) was especially eyebrow-raising because most theorists expect him to die early on in TWOW. Surely George has completed at least the first half of TWOW after all of this time, and so why in the world would he be working on a Victarion chapter? The answer, I believe, is that George has completed a full draft of the manuscript and is now circling back to earlier chapters in the novel in order to do a final round of editing. 

Another piece of evidence for this is that George has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he is working on Arya chapters set in Braavos. This is curious because George has talked about how he has already written a lot of Arya material in the past (a short novella's worth!), and, ostensibly, Arya's Braavos chapters should take place in the beginning to middle of TWOW since she will likely return to Westeros at some point during the novel. Again, I think the explanation that makes the most sense is that George is doing a final round of editing rather than writing completely new Arya chapters.

**Conclusion**

As George said in a [recent post](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/06/23/writing-reading-writing/), ""It’s going to be a huge book, and I still have a long way to go."" I think this statement combined with his optimism about progress on TWOW is consistent with George doing a final round of editing on the novel, but only being in the initial stages of said revisions. That would mean he does have a long way to go in terms of the number of chapters to revise, but that he believes the manuscript is generally in good shape and so doesn't need any more *major* revisions. That being said, even if I'm right George could still find major problems with the manuscript that require significant revisions, delaying the release of the book further. However, I'm hopeful 2021 will be the year that winter does indeed come.",asoiaf,[Spoilers Published] TWOW Theory: George is Doing a Final Round of Editing (though that could still take awhile!)

#Background

**Robert had 16 bastards according to Maggy the Frog's prophecy**

&gt;Anger flashed across the child's face. ""If she tries I will have my brother kill her."" Even then she would not stop, willful child as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse into her life to come. ""Will the king and I have children?"" she asked. ""Oh, aye. **Six-and-ten for him**, and three for you."" That made no sense to Cersei. Her thumb was throbbing where she'd cut it, and her blood was dripping on the carpet. How could that be? she wanted to ask, but she was done with her questions. -AFFC, Cersei VIII

**Varys knows of 8 of these 16**

&gt;**""He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing,""** Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle. ""Their mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all black as ravens . . . and as ill-omened, it would seem. So when Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen slid out between your sister's thighs, each as golden as the sun, the truth was not hard to glimpse."" -ACOK, Tyrion III

***

#The Reader's Knowledge

So far the reader has encountered/heard about **7 of the bastards**.

**Gendry**

&gt;The master called over a tall lad about Robb's age, his arms and chest corded with muscle. ""This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King,"" he told him **as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink.** The shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw. ""This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad."" Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench, and a steel helm shaped like a bull's head, with two great curving horns. -AGOT, Eddard VI

**Barra**

&gt;The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age. No doubt she'd been a virgin; the better brothels could always find a virgin, if the purse was fat enough. She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, he saw that her bosom was freckled as well. **""I named her Barra,"" she said as the child nursed. ""She looks so like him, does she not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair …""**

&gt;**""She does."" Eddard Stark had touched the baby's fine, dark hair. It flowed through his fingers like black silk. Robert's firstborn had had the same fine hair, he seemed to recall.** -AGOT, Eddard IX

**Mya Stone**

&gt;Ned remembered Robert's first child as well, a daughter born in the Vale when Robert was scarcely more than a boy himself. A sweet little girl; the young lord of Storm's End had doted on her. He used to make daily visits to play with the babe, long after he had lost interest in the mother. Ned was often dragged along for company, whether he willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, he realized; older than Robert had been when he fathered her. A strange thought. -AGOT, Eddard VII

**Edric Storm**

&gt;""There's proof of a sort at Storm's End. **Robert's bastard. The one he fathered on my wedding night, in the very bed they'd made up for me and my bride. Delena was a Florent, and a maiden when he took her, so Robert acknowledged the babe. Edric Storm, they call him. He is said to be the very image of my brother.** If men were to see him, and then look again at Joffrey and Tommen, they could not help but wonder, I would think."" -ACOK, Davos I

and:

&gt;""Of course you are."" Davos had known that almost at once. The lad had the prominent ears of a Florent, **but the hair, the eyes, the jaw, the cheekbones, those were all Baratheon**. -ASOS, Davos II

***

**Bella**

Some might argued its not confirmed. Its close enough imo.

&gt;""Well, I might be."" When the girl shrugged, her gown slipped off one shoulder. ""They say King Robert fucked my mother when he hid here, back before the battle. Not that he didn't have all the other girls too, but Leslyn says he liked my ma the best.""

&gt;**The girl did have hair like the old king's, Arya thought; a great thick mop of it, as black as coal. That doesn't mean anything, though. Gendry has the same kind of hair too. Lots of people have black hair.**

&gt;""I'm named Bella,"" the girl told Gendry. ""For the battle. I bet I could ring your bell, too. You want to?"" -ASOS, Arya V

***

**Twins at Casterly Rock**

&gt;""Does it matter? If you bed enough women, some will give you presents, and His Grace has never been shy on that count. I know he's acknowledged that boy at Storm's End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed. He could hardly do otherwise. The mother was a Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of her bedmaids. Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing. Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wife's House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly."" He gave Ned a sideways glance. **""I've also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock,** three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin's tourney. Cersei had the babes killed, and sold the mother to a passing slaver. Too much an affront to Lannister pride, that close to home."" -AGOT, Eddard IX

***

While it can't be 100% confirmed that 7 the reader knows about that Varys knows about as well, but I think that all of them are quite likely options for Varys to know about. But the question is raised, who else does Varys know about?

Back in that original post of mine some of the following ideas were mentioned:

- Taena Merryweather's son Russell (Her husband seems uninterested in her and she seems to not want to bring him around Cersei and its also possible she slept with robert to get her husband's lands back)

&gt;The horn-of-plenty Hand. Jaime remembered Owen Merryweather well enough; an amiable man, but ineffectual. ""As I recall, he did so well that Aerys exiled him and seized his lands.""

&gt;**""Robert gave them back. Some, at least**. Taena would be pleased if Orton could recover the rest.""

and:

&gt;But it was no good. She could not feel it, whatever Robert felt on the nights he took her. There was no pleasure in it, not for her. For Taena, yes. Her nipples were two black diamonds, her sex slick and steamy. **Robert would have loved you, for an hour.** The queen slid a finger into that Myrish swamp, then another, moving them in and out, but once he spent himself inside you, he would have been hard-pressed to recall your name.

and:

&gt;Not so Orton Merryweather, whose round face remained blotched and pale from broth to cheese. He drank heavily and **kept stealing glances at the singer.**

and:

&gt;Of late she had shared the queen's bed more often than Lord Merryweather's. Orton did not seem to mind . . . or if he did, he knew better than to say so.

""Robert gave them back. Some, at least. Taena would be pleased if Orton could recover the rest.""

- Bastard via his cousin on Greenstone aka Greenshit

&gt;There had been a female cousin too, a chunky little widow with breasts as big as melons whose husband and father had both died at Storm's End during the siege. ""Her father was good to me,"" Robert told her, ""and she and I would play together when the two of us were small."" **It did not take him long to start playing with her again. As soon as Cersei closed her eyes, the king would steal off to console the poor lonely creature. One night she had Jaime follow him, to confirm her suspicions.** When her brother returned he asked her if she wanted Robert dead. ""No,"" she had replied, ""I want him horned."" She liked to think that was the night when Joffrey was conceived. -AFFC, Cersei V

- The Wall (Characters such as Satin/Grenn)

#Update

Since this post I've came across/come up with the following:

[Grenn is a Possible Bastard of Robert Baratheon](https://reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/d2y42b/grenn_is_a_possible_bastard_of_robert_baratheon/) (not a very serious theory but some of the parallels are super cool, but Grenn's beard is described as brown at one point so that probably disqualifies him)

***

**Satin**

Satin has dark eyes:

&gt;The boy claimed to be eighteen, older than Jon, but he was green as summer grass for all that. Satin, they called him, even in the wool and mail and boiled leather of the Night's Watch; the name he'd gotten in the brothel where he'd been born and raised. He was pretty as a girl **with his dark eyes**, soft skin, and raven's ringlets. Half a year at Castle Black had toughened up his hands, however, and Noye said he was passable with a crossbow. Whether he had the courage to face what was coming, though .

***

**Greenstone/Estermont has fallen to fAegon and the Golden Company and they have taken hostages**

If Robert had a bastard with his cousin on Estermont (and she had the child), we have a possible chance to see him in the Jon Con/Arianne chapers.

&gt;Later that day, garbed and gloved once more, Connington made an inspection of the castle and sent word to Homeless Harry Strickland and his captains to join him for a war council. Nine of them assembled in the solar: Connington and Strickland, Haldon Halfmaester, Black Balaq, Ser Franklyn Flowers, Malo Jayn, Ser Brendel Byrne, Dick Cole, and Lymond Pease. The Halfmaester had good tidings. ""Word's reached the camp from Marq Mandrake. **The Volantenes put him ashore on what turned out to be Estermont, with close to five hundred men. He's taken Greenstone.""**

&gt;""I expect they did,"" said Jon Connington, ""but what messages would they have carried? At best, some garbled account of raiders from the sea."" Even before they had sailed from Volon Therys, he had instructed his captains to show no banners during these first attacks—not Prince Aegon's three-headed dragon, nor his own griffins, nor the skulls and golden battle standards of the company. Let the Lannisters suspect Stannis Baratheon, pirates from the Stepstones, outlaws out of the woods, or whoever else they cared to blame. If the reports that reached King's Landing were confused and contradictory, so much the better. The slower the Iron Throne was to react, the longer they would have to gather their strength and bring allies to the cause. There should be ships on Estermont. It is an island. Haldon, send word to Mandrake to leave a garrison behind and **bring the rest of his men over to Cape Wrath, along with any noble captives.""**

&gt;**""As you command, my lord. House Estermont has blood ties to both kings, as it happens. Good hostages.""**

&gt;**""Good ransoms,""** said Homeless Harry, happily. -ADWD, The Griffin Reborn

So in the upcoming TWOW Jon Connington/Arianne chapters we could see a captive who looks like Robert it would be interesting. Especially since it was with his cousin. Since this child would likely have been conceived around the same time as Joffrey (unless he made return trips), this child would be around 14 years old right now.

***

Let me know any thoughts you may have on the above or any additional characters. Keep in mind that every one of them has dark hair:

&gt;Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle. **""Their mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all black as ravens . . .** -ACOK, Tyrion III

And every one except Bella is confirmed to have blue eyes by the main text (the semi-canon app does confirm I believe).

It helps somewhat when looking to start with trips Robert made during different time periods (for instance celebrating the victory on Pyke, etc.)

1837,"While re-reading AGOT on Catelyn's chapter I noticed a small tiny detail, nothing of importance. When Catelyn tries to go back to Winterfell with Ser Rodrick Cassel and they stop on the Crossroads Inn. She noticed the innkeeper and recognized her from her childhood and how the lady would be extra nice to them and give them sweets. But since she is hiding her identity as Cat of Winterfell she says nothing. And notices how the innkeeper treats everybody like shit and reminisces her treatment from childhood, or so I interpreted. But the innkeeper was probably nice to Cat for being the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully, and a citizen from the area would probably want the children of their lord to be happy. But if she was some child or bastard of common birth the treatment would be more sour. Anyways just some thoughts.",asoiaf,(Spoilers extended) small detail from AGOT

The whole time she was acting like it was Renly who needed Robb’s alliance, despite the fact that she knew Renly had 100,000 thousand men, meanwhile Robb had a fraction of that. Her visit achieved nothing, and if Renly or Stannis proved victorious they would have dealt with Robb more harshly thanks to Cat’s insolence.

1857,"In Tyrion's original version of the story, was Tysha raped? Here's what he says to Bronn:

&gt;After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, **Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards. They paid her fair enough.** A silver for each man, how many whores command that high a price? He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor, she …"" The smoke was stinging his eyes. Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into darkness. ""Lord Tywin had me go last,"" he said in a quiet voice. ""And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more.

When I first read the scene I assumed Tysha consented to the sex, considering the guards paid her for it and she was a whore. But after Jaime reveals the truth to him, he considers her to have been raped by his guards and himself.

&gt;He thought of Tysha and wondered where whores go. Why not Volantis? Perhaps I'll find her there. A man should cling to hope. He wondered what he would say to her. **I am sorry that I let them rape you, love.** I thought you were a whore. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?

So did Tyrion always know about the rape? This always confused me because I don't think it's possible for him to have watched her get raped without knowing. This seemed to me like a retcon at first.

Maester Aemon : So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?

Jon Snow : He... he would do whatever was right. No matter what.

Maester Aemon : Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?

1874,"I saw a thread about how people feel about the TV show a year later and most people said they will never watch it again after knowing how bad the ending was. Initially I agreed, but then I watched S1-S4 and had a blast from start to finish What's more, it felt like I was watching a complete story on it's own.

I really enjoy the first three books. I also enjoy AFFC (it may be even my favorite), but it feels more like a standalone book than a continuation or even the beginning of a new series. Tried a few times, but never managed to finish ADWD. It's the same with the show for me. I can see myself watching the first four seasons, but I have no desire to ever watch the later seasons again. That got me thinking about why that is.

One of the main themes of the first three books is family relationships. The books explore how different kinds of families may fare in an environment like Westeros and how it impacts the individual and culminates in a truly terrific conclusion in ASOS.

It's true, there are many unresolved story threads at the end of ASOS, but those were never central to the main story. It doesn't really matter if Stannis or Dany take the Iron Throne or not. Or who the White Walkers and Children of the Forrest really are. Or if Bran becomes the Three Eyed Raven, Or who Coldhands is. Or who Jons mother is. Or if the Starks get their revenge. All those are questions that add to the mystery of the world and certainly will nag at you for not being answered, but those answers are more important for the world itself than they are for the story that was being told in the first three books. Most characters have their arc completed at the end of ASOS and even more so at the end of Season 4. And more importantly, the theme of family vs the individual got pushed to its limits during the climax of ASOS. There's nothing left to explore there, and so with AFFC/ADWD GRRM sets up a new character arcs and plants the seeds of a revenge story. A story that I am sure will be told well, but also feels completely different tonally.

I fear the story peaked with ASOS and should have ended there. It's a bittersweet ending for most characters that I don't think can be surpassed. It also makes the story more realistic than having to deal with all the supernatural stuff that has to become more important at some point. I'm also not looking forward to seeing our heroes eventually succeeding, even if it comes at a cost. I think the ending at ASOS is poignant and succinct, in that we already can see that Jon, Sansa and Arya are winning in different ways, even though they are without a protective family and have lost the Game of Thrones to the Lannisters. We can also picture the fall-out of Tywins death and that in the end, nobody's really winning at the Game Of Thrones. It's a very mature message and an ending that could have really shaken the foundations of the fantasy genre. It also keeps the subversive nature of GRRMs storytelling in tact. The heroes don't defeat the monsters or the bad guys, but they are still better off for it.

My point is that GRRM is probably going for a similar ending thematically, in that nobody wins at the Game of Thrones, but he will have to do it while including dragons, ice-zombies and green people and manage to keep it from becoming ham-fisted. In short: I think the story concluded thematically for most characters in ASOS and everything afterwards is just done to eventually answer some lesser important questions. It's probably why GRRM takes so long to write now. The ink is dry.",asoiaf,(Spoilers main) The main story of ASOIAF finished with ASOS and everything afterwards is just filler.
1875,"To me it seems a lot of people question why Littlefinger is not distrusted by the majority of the characters. That’s absolutely a misconception! He’s seen, in universe, as a trustworthy and loyal figure. He’s charming, witty, and a source of wealth and influence. He’s a childhood friend of Cat. We the audience only glean his Machiavellian, manipulative, ambitious self because we see certain perspectives that begin to realize this.

1876,"TL;DR: Good source for a quick summation on Chapters/Books before TWOW releases?

Hey guys, I'm a bit worried that when TWOW releases I will have forgotten quite a bit of the story in the series, especially now that the show series has ended and we're going on over 9 years since ADWD has released. When the show first began to really move away from the books I noticed that I would start to confuse names, people and events unfolding between the two mediums. I started and finished the book series soon after season 2 of the show concluded, and even now when I catch myself checking this subreddit for any new theories or news on TWOW I find myself forgetting certain plot lines or characters in the books that were not included in the show.

I enjoy reading but I have never been interested in rereading a book, let alone a series this big, when there is so much more out there to consume.

1881,"I don't know how many ASOIAF fans have read Abercrombie, but I amused myself for 10 minutes today imagining the characters from his First Law novels in Westeros during the events of the series and how they'd fare.

The Union characters like West and Jezal would probably be Reacherman or Westerman serving Cersei, so I'd hope Jezal wouldn't catch her eye and become Lancel 2.0. Monza Murcatto and Cosca would no doubt be leading a free company in Essos, but for Dany or against her? For their sake I'd hope it'd be the former.

1885,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She threw back the shutters and shivered as gooseprickles rose along her arms. There were clouds massing in the eastern sky, pierced by shafts of sunlight. They look like two huge castles afloat in the morning sky. Sansa could see their walls of tumbled stone, their mighty keeps and barbicans. Wispy banners swirled from atop their towers and reached for the fast-fading stars. The sun was coming up behind them, and she watched them go from black to grey to a thousand shades of rose and gold and crimson. Soon the wind mushed them together, and there was only one castle where there had been two. 

*A Storm of Swords* \- Sansa IV 

At dawn on the morning of Joffrey’s and Margaery’s nuptials, Sansa Lannister sees two castles in the sky which become one. On the surface, a charming sign of the upcoming ceremony, but when we take another look at the text, we find it’s not quite as positive as it is on first sight. 

‘Castles in the sky’ is a phrase that refers to futile dreams or desires. Not the best omen for a wedding, is it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rose is a colour, a flower, and a verb in the past tense and in this paragraph, GRRM uses two of the meanings. 

'...gooseprickles rose along her arms' 

Sansa feels the cool autumn dawn here. Winter is coming!   

   

&amp;#x200B;

“... a thousand shades of rose and gold and crimson.”  

In the other mention of ‘rose’, we seem to get a play on words referring to the  Tyrell roses, with ‘gold and crimson’ alluding to House Lannister. 

The ominous nature of the spectacle is further marked by Brella, the former housekeeper of Lord Renly

&gt;""A castle, is it?"" Brella had to squint. ""That tower's tumbling over, looks like. It's all ruins, that is.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Sansa did not want to hear about falling towers and ruined castles.  

Could this be a foreshadowing of the destruction of the Hand’s Tower during the celebration of King Tommen’s wedding? 

Intriguing as may be that possibility, there’s another little detail  that arises in ASOS about roses, but associated with the twilight, rather than the dawn.

&gt;On the road from Yunkai, Daario had brought her a flower or a sprig of some plant every evening when he made his report . . . to help her learn the land, he said. Waspwillow, dusky roses, wild mint, lady's lace, daggerleaf, broom, prickly ben, harpy's gold . . . 

*A Storm of Swords* \- Daenerys V 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The king looked near as splendid as his bride, in his doublet of dusky rose, beneath a cloak of deep crimson velvet blazoned with his stag and lion. 

*A Storm of Swords* \- Tyrion VIII  

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a relation between these references in ASOS? 

It looks to me as though something is being hinted at here, especially when taken with this other appearance of roses in a conversation between Sansa Stark and Loras Tyrell 

&gt; He doesn't remember, Sansa realized, startled. He is only being kind to me, he doesn't remember me or the rose or any of it. She had been so certain that it meant something, that it meant everything. A red rose, not a white.

""Guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall, don't we?"" He laughed again, and the others laughed with him. ""Where's your stick now?""

""Not so brave now that I'm not in chains, are you?""

1898,"Given Joffrey’s age, I have to assume that this conversation had been had long before Jon Arryn’s death, before the possibility of Sansa even entered Robert’s mind. I’m just curious as to which names might have been floated about. Perhaps there’s a passage in the book that answers this question but I don’t recall any. The go-to answer might be Margaery Tyrell but I doubt that. At the time, it does seem like the Tyrell’s knew of the incest, at least to a degree, via Renly and didn’t expect Joffrey to succeed. Hence why Renly is trying to play matchmaker with Robert and Margaery in Book One. And in the Crownlands and at court in King’s Landing, it seems like there’s a bit of a shortage of eligible brides present. The only one of the right age that I can recall is Lollys Stokeworth and there’s like a -5000% chance that such a match would EVER be considered. 

So unless there are characters that just haven’t warranted a mention in the story (which is possible: some characters have unnamed children while others we don’t know if they have children or not), I have to assume that Joffrey would have been betrothed to someone from the Westerlands. Seems likely as we do have several recorded instances of Joffrey visiting Casterly Rock with his mother and siblings and none that I recall (but I could be wrong) of him spending any time in Storm’s End. Now, I’m sure he’s been to Storm’s End but I think that it’s clear to deduce that he’s spent more time at the Rock, given that only those visits get textual mentions. And he seems to have more familiarity with his Lannister family than his Baratheon uncles (or who he assumes are his uncles). And if we’re looking to the Westerlands, one bride stands out to me and that’s Jeyne Westerling. Yes, I think it’s very possible that Jeyne Westerling could have been THE Queen in another life although, if this match were considered, it probably hadn’t progressed to the point of an offer as Jeyne never mentions it, nor does Sybell Spicer or Cersei for that matter.

1900,"**TL;DR: I think Tyrion telling Aegon to go west instead of east was good advice, do you agree?**

In Dance Tyrion suggests to Aegon that he should head west to invade Westeros instead of going to Dany and ask for support and marriage. He gives the following reasons:

&gt; Now, how do you suppose this queen will react when you turn up with your begging bowl in hand and say, 'Good morrow to you, Auntie. I am your nephew, Aegon, returned from the dead. I've been hiding on a poleboat all my life, but now I've washed the blue dye from my hair and I'd like a dragon, please … and oh, did I mention, my claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than your own?' ""

The implication being she wouldn't support him. He also suggests the 7K are ripe for conquest:

&gt;If I were you? I would go west instead of east. Land in Dorne and raise my banners. The Seven Kingdoms will never be more ripe for conquest than they are right now. A boy king sits the Iron Throne. The north is in chaos, the riverlands a devastation, a rebel holds Storm's End and Dragonstone. When winter comes, the realm will starve. And who remains to deal with all of this, who rules the little king who rules the Seven Kingdoms? Why, my own sweet sister. There is no one else. My brother, Jaime, thirsts for battle, not for power. He's run from every chance he's had to rule. My uncle Kevan would make a passably good regent if someone pressed the duty on him, but he will never reach for it. The gods shaped him to be a follower, not a leader."" Well, the gods and my lord father. ""Mace Tyrell would grasp the sceptre gladly, but mine own kin are not like to step aside and give it to him. And everyone hates Stannis. Who does that leave? Why, only Cersei.

Do you think this is good advice? Tyrion later describes it as bait, implying it was bad advice.

&gt;Could this be some ploy of Griff's, false reports deliberately spread? Unless … Could the pretty princeling have swallowed the bait? Turned them west instead of east, abandoning his hopes of wedding Queen Daenerys? Abandoning the dragons … would Griff allow that?

But to me it seems like pretty good advice. If Aegon went east, I honestly doubt Dany would've supported him. At the time, she was very intent on keeping Slaver's Bay in line and didn't want to abandon her children. Plus she didn't have control over her dragons and she'd have no reason to believe he's the actual Aegon Targaryen. And the Golden Company would have to deal with the Yunkai'i blockade as well.

Aegon going west has gone pretty well so far. He's taken a few castles and apparently has a plan to take Storm's End. Thanks to Varys, Kevan is dead and the Lannisters and Tyrells will soon be tearing each other apart, plus Euron is bothering the Reach and Stannis is freezing in the North.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Was Tyrion's advice good?

In ADWD's prologue we get Varamyr the warg. Once he was feared by villagers and had used to have sex with their women:  

&gt;“Before Mance, Varamyr Sixskins had been a lord of sorts. He lived alone in a hall of moss and mud and hewn logs that had once been Haggon’s, attended by his beasts. A dozen villages did him homage in bread and salt and cider, offering him fruit from their orchards and vegetables from their gardens. His meat he got himself. **Whenever he desired a woman he sent his shadowcat to stalk her, and whatever girl he’d cast his eye upon would follow meekly to his bed. Some came weeping, aye, but still they came. Varamyr gave them his seed, took a hank of their hair to remember them by, and sent them back.**”

   

Later on in the chapter, we find out he used to warg one his female-wolves whilst being mated by one his male-wolves:  

&gt;“Not Sly (female wolf) . Haggon would have called it abomination, but Varamyr had often slipped inside her skin as she was being mounted by One Eye (male wolf).”

1924,"Let me preface this post with the caveat that this was a somewhat random thought that had occurred to me. It likely has no merit; but I just wanted to throw it out there to see if anyone could develop it further. Apologies if someone has already posted something similar.

I think there are some ties to Robert’s Rebellion and Homer’s Iliad. Most likely, GRRM didn’t not intend this connection, although perhaps he did. 

Both stories are about a woman who is “stolen” and causes a great war to erupt. Both stories end with a major city being sacked. In both stories, the side looking to reclaim the “stolen” woman is victorious, although unable to reclaim the “stolen” woman that sparked the war.

Here are some character parallels: 

&gt; Lyanna Stark = Helen (of Troy)
&gt;&gt;Rhaegar Targaryen = Paris + Hector
&gt;&gt; Robert Baratheon = Menelaus + Agamemnon 

Additional possible parallels (I’m just spit-ballin’ here):

&gt; Jon Connington = Hector (fought and was ~~killed~~ [exiled] for ~~Hector~~ [Rhaegar]
&gt;&gt; Jon Arryn = Agamemnon (first to call the banners)
&gt;&gt; King Aerys II = King Priam (not in character, but in role)
&gt;&gt; Eddard Stark = Odysseus?

That, of course, leaves out Achilles. I think Achilles’ closest parallel would be Jaime Lannister. Both Jaime and Achilles are dubious about fight for their respective side. Moreover, Achilles dies during the Sack of Troy and Jaime(‘s honor) dies during the Sack of Kingslanding.

Anyway, *please* do not crucify my for this lol. It was just meant to be a bit of fun. I already know it likely has little to no bearing; I don’t really want to hear how wrong I am.

1926,"In this chapter Jon encounters four different people that all turn out not to be who Jon (or the reader) thinks they are.  (I'm using a somewhat loose definition of ""encounter"";  Jon encounters two of these people in person and the other two in speech or writing.)

Two - Jon learns of Ramsey's marriage to Arya, who is actually Jeyne Poole

Three - Jon sees Ygritte, who is actually Melisandre 

Four - Jon learns of ""a girl in grey on a dying horse,"" who Mel believes is Arya, but is actually Alys Karstark

The thematic consistency and overall timing of events to get all of these encounters to happen in a single chapter is pretty amazing and a huge testament to GRRM's writing ability.

1927,"Big messy theory warning, here's a *TL:DR: Evidence suggests that Pigs maybe be used in the Second Siege of Mereen against the Slaver Coalition's War Elephants, thanks to Tyrion, and of all people: Penny and her jousting pig.*

As we are aware, the Yunkai and their coalition are besieging Mereen.

As well, so far we know, the Second Siege is going in favour for the defenders, Tyrion II reveals that the Second Sons and Windblown have defected to Mereen's side, not to mention we have Ironborn at the Sea attacking the Qarthi fleets. But this battle could turn because of the Slaver Coalition's use of elephants. We know they're coming:

&gt; The Yunkai'i are marching their host up the coast road, joined by four legions out of New Ghis. They have elephants, a hundred, armored and towered. - ADWD, Daenerys VI

and paraphrasing from what Preston Jacobs said in his Prepping for Winter, Tyrion II, if he is correct the War Elephants are almost arriving at Mereen:

&gt; From the east the sound of drumming rolled across the parched plain. - TWOW Sample, Tyrion II

And we also know that Rhaegal and Viserion are flying around due to Quentyn's shenanigans (and of course Drogon with Dany in the Dothraki Sea), when they were released when he tried to play hero, and got burnt to a crisp.

But back to the War Elephants, they'e scary at first, until *fire* comes into play, and like all animals, when Fire comes into play, it's time to get the hell out of there, and Elephants are infamous in various accounts of war for being easily spooked - such as by even the squeals of pigs. One such tactic took this further, and in 266 BC, according to the ancient historians Polyaenus and Aelian, the Antigonid Siege of Megara was broken by the defenders by deploying Pigs covered in pitch that were set alight, which would be driven towards the Antigonid forces, causing the War Elephants to flee in terror and trample their own forces.

Of course, this battle isn't dealing with Pigs, at least not of what we know of, except:
**Penny is on this little adventure with Tyrion, and we know she owns a Pig, which she used for mock jousts with her brother Oppo, this pig (and the dog) was left behind in Mereen when Tyrion and Penny fled**. I believe this is deliberate, she is generally regarded as a pointless character by many, pointless in this adventure, her purpose here is that she will remind Tyrion of her animals. Further more during the attempt for Peace in which Daenerys marries Hizdahr, the fighting pits are reopened, one fight has the Pit Fighter Barsena, fight a boar and die, when Drogon swoops down, eats the boar, and causes chaos. **A Boar is just the ancestor to the domesticated pig, and it's directly linked to a dragon.** Due to Fighting Pits being reopened being a sort of grand event in a city, it is heavily likely there is going to be a lot of Pigs in the city's walls.

Tyrion has been going down memory lane according to Tyrion II, specifically the Battle of Blackwater, and it's parallels to the Second Siege of Mereen, and we know Stannis' forces were decimated by his little trick involving **wildfire**. Interesting enough, in the Battle of Blackwater the Lannister defenders fired pitch at Stannis' forces and ships (Davos III, ACOK) this is something Tyrion should remember. And if Preston Jacobs is correct, part of the purpose of the Siege Trebuchets firing corpses is to test correct ranges, and distances for firing pitch. 

We know that some of Daenerys sellswords have claimed a couple of these Trebuchets according to Tyrion II, with the Seconds revealing them joining the Slavers was a ploy, and they are nearby to the largest treb: Harridan which Barristan and his forces are on their way to claiming, **a ripe opportunity for Tyrion**.

It's likely when Winds of Winter finally comes out, at some point in a future Tyrion chapter, it is likely the elephants (and the large majority of the Coalition's troops) will have reorganized (and the Elephants have joined) by the time Harridan is taken. Tyrion, Barristan, Second Sons, and everyone else will have no choice but to flee back inside Mereen, or be slaughtered, taking the pitch with them in order to use it against the Slavers.

Inside Mereen, Tyrion will probably be reminded by Penny about her animals, likely in an initially offhand comment. But Tyrion will have a big brain moment, and come to the conclusion of using the pitch on the Mereenese Pigs. Alternatively Tyrion could suggest taking the Pitch with them to Barristan, being reminded of Penny's pig, but use it nonetheless.

Now, how are the Dragons involved, we know there is a throwaway event with Barsena's Death, and Drogon killing the boar that ate her, but other than that...what? Viserion and Rhaegal are flying around, and Tyrion II mentions they are burning, then snatching some of the corpses being launched by the Slaver Trebs. It is likely that if they see these Pitch-covered Pigs, they will see it as a better alternative meal, setting all of them alight, and eating some of them (of course it shouldn't have much of an effect, Dragons are immune to fire after all) with the surviving pigs running towards the Slaver Elephants, spooking them, and accidentally wiping out a big chunk of the re-organized slaver forces, cause the Elephants and their drivers to flee the battlefield, perhaps even temporarily until Daenerys arrives with Drogon and the Dothraki to finally lift the siege. 

Or this could just outright win the battle, and Tyrion's worth would be solidified when Daenerys finally returns, and much to his chagrin is praised by the Mereenese as a hero, thus quashing the ""Damn Cavalry saving the day at the end for the Heroes trope"".

This little trick would be a nice throwback to the Battle of Blackwater Bay, and be a nice way to prove Tyrion's worth to Daenarys. I know this theory is pretty messy, and there are probably a dozen examples that could be used to further prove or disprove this battle theory, but nonetheless thanks for reading.",asoiaf,"(Spoilers TWOW) [SSOM Theory] Tyrion, Dragons, and War Elephants vs...

My head has fallen,the rest they sack,

With a heart like stone I will take back,

What was mine even if the towers rise,

A corpse will flay those loveless eyes.

The songs I sang came at a huge cost,

A boyhood blunder was all that I'd done,

To get drowned in red, nowhere to run..

1965,"I've been thinking a lot about dragons but haven't really seen any real discussions about where they come from or other theories surrounding them. In awoiaf they talk about it but keep it intentionally vague presumably to get our imaginations goin. 

We ""know"" that Dany's hatched through magical means, I guess, but I'm not entirely sure that that's all there is to it. In AKotSK, Egg talks about how Targs keep their eggs with them since birth in the cradle in hopes of them hatching and so they can bond with them. Dany didn't have hers since birth, but she did have an unborn Targ growing in her since she got the eggs basically, and a powerful man who probably could have become a dragon rider if he really wanted to around all the time as well. What if the three eggs bonded with her, the baby, and Drogo? Illyrio claims that the eggs were petrified and centuries old, but what if that wasn't true and they were recently laid somewhere where dragons still lived, presuming they're not all actually dead? So something pertaining to the heat of the funeral pyre and the bond with the three being burned maybe lead to their hatching? Very loose theory that I haven't really fleshed out but I think I like it better than them hatching with retaliatory blood magic alone, seems like an evil beginning to the dragons but maybe that's the point. 

Something else I've seen mentioned is that people don't think Valyrians are wargs, but the way they connect with their dragons seems like a similar phenomenon. Even with Dany's horse, Silver, she seemed like instantly and weirdly attuned with her. 

Also about the origin of them, are they purely magical creatures? They don't seem naturally evolved or bred.

1974," 

Much  and more has been written about Martin deciding to abandon the 5 year  gap and then split the 4th book into two, but I was curious if there's  been much information available on the decisions he made prior to that.  I'm interested in structure and writing in general, but I think it's of  special note when reading ASOIAF. For instance, when he wrote the House  of the Undying sequence, was he thinking about a 5 year gap at that  point? Or was he still thinking it was only going to be 4 books then?  Knowing this could definitely help possible interpretations of that  sequence.

On a similar note, has  there been much discussion (there may not be enough info publicly  available) on what the series was going to look like prior to the 5 Year  Gap but after he chucked the trilogy outline from 93?

I've  long seen bits and pieces (for instance, that Amazon blurb that cropped  up around 2000 or so, which may or may not be real) that hint at the  evolution of the series prior to his decision to do a 5 Year Gap, but  there's not much compared to all the writing about his brief idea of a  gap and then discarding it.

In the historic lore of Westeros, it's the place where the Children and the First Men made their peace treaty. In the current story, it's talked about a little bit, but no-one's actually gone there. Harrenhal is nearby, and enough has happened there to last the whole series, but there's no way GRRM would have this very unique location and not have something major happen there surely.

* Bran travels back to the moment of The Pact and learns a vital piece of information. This could be likely, one if the few things we know about the Isle of Faces is there's known Weirwood trees there.
* A new peace pact is made there in the current day. I'm not sure between which parties. Might be a bit too poetic as well.

1993,"So, their is my little theory. I would love to know your thoughts on it, and if by any chance you knew someone who developed it better and more accurately. 

(TLDR at the bottom)

So, for starters, I firmly believe that every type of magic in aSoIaF universe is linked to the skinchanging ability. One base, multiple iterations due to cultural differences. Dragon's taming, ""resurrections"" caused by the Others and the fire priests, green dreams, weirwood trips, glass candles, and shadowbending. Everything is about transferring one consciousness (or only its thoughts) into others body.

(I began to write all this to respond to a comment about MMD and the poisoning of Drogo. It  grew way more than I anticipated, but I'll let what I said about it anyway)

So, to begin with, MMD did poisoned Drogo right from the start. Maybe he accelerated the process by being dumb, or perhaps he gained few days of life thanks to the rubbing of some shit on his wound, we'll never know.

Then she found a mean to poisoned Rhaego. As it is heavily hinted in F&amp;B, through the story of Maegor and Tyanna. The deformities of the new born child wasn't caused by Jorah and his entrance in the tent, but by a poison she succeeded to gave to Dany.

Now, things get interesting. The shadows of shadowbending are, imho, ""naked"" consciousness ""solidified"" by a the arts of the shadowbender. She killed the horse to take his, and poured it into Drogo's body, hence his stat after all that. She probably took the one of Drogo in the process, maybe the one of Rahego too (more improbable). Others consciousness joined the ""dance"" since she is, supposedly, a beginners in the art of shadowbending. 

So, I think that's why the dragons hatched. She, accidentally, or willingly, put foreign consciousness into the dragons. Drogo could very well really be inside Drogon, as Rhaego with Rhaegal. Though, as Varamyr teach us, their ego is more than probably totally destroyed.
I could even go as far as suppose that this is how all dragons are tamed, by shadowbend a human consciousness inside of them, then by ""controlling"" and ""communicating"" with them through a very basic and intuitive skinchanging ability the Targs (or the Valyriens) naturally have. 

Finally, that could explain why Rahegar needed Lyanna so bad, to enforce and get back the ability of the Targaryen bloodline, still present and particularly powerful in the Stark family (maybe present in every descendent of the first men too, but less powerful). This is why the Targaryen traditionally married their own family. In order to preserve and avoid dilution of their abilities to control dragons. Maybe the Maesters understood this at one point, and did all they could to mingled Targaryen blood with Andals blood. Since they were in charge of all the writing, of all the communications between lords, knowing who would marry who, knowing where they needed to push and pull in order to manipulate all the nobility.

Finally over. Thanks a lot to have read all this, 'hope it was at least entertaining, and not to dull or incomprehensible to read (since I'm not a native speaker). I wish the best for all of you, fellow summer and winterchild!

TLDR :
- All magics are different form of skinchanging 
- MMD poisoned Drogo, Dany, and Rahego.
- Jorah is totally innocent about the fate of the later 
- Horse's mind was inside Drogo's body
- Dragon's eggs hatch because consciousness was poured into them
- That's how all are dragons are tamed
- It can explain the behaviors of Rahegar and the slow downfall of the Targ.
- It could be, partly, a nation wide conspiracy of the Maesters.",asoiaf,"[Spoiler Extended] Tinfoil theory on Mirri Maz Duur, the nature of magic, and the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty"

Now that Im done shamelessly self promoting, I will say that those two posts got me thinking about Marwyn's past and some of the characters he has met.

**Marwyn has already met two ""magical"" characters. What are the chances for two more?**

***

#Previous Encounters

We already know that Marwyn has met two of the more sketchy side characters in the series.

**Mirr Maz Duur**

&gt;**""Marwyn, he named himself,""** the woman replied in the Common Tongue. ""From the sea. Beyond the sea. The Seven Lands, he said. Sunset Lands. Where men are iron and dragons rule. He taught me this speech.""

&gt;""A maester in Asshai,"" Ser Jorah mused. ""Tell me, Godswife, **what did this Marwyn wear about his neck?**""

&gt;""A chain so tight it was like to choke him, Iron Lord, with links of many metals."" -AGOT, Daenerys VII

Mirri begins by seeming like an aid to Dany (providing help to Drogo) before it is revealed that she actually isn't all the ""good"" she is thought to be as she is involved in Drogo/Rhaego's death/blood magic and is later ritually sacrificed by Dany.

***

**Qyburn**

First, I love this passage from Qyburn. The fact that he brings up Marwyn at the end makes it even better:

&gt;That is the last thing I mean to do. The moonlight glimmered pale upon the stump where Jaime had rested his head. The moss covered it so thickly he had not noticed before, but now he saw that the wood was white. It made him think of Winterfell, and Ned Stark's heart tree. It was not him, he thought. It was never him. But the stump was dead and so was Stark and so were all the others, Prince Rhaegar and Ser Arthur and the children. And Aerys. Aerys is most dead of all. ""Do you believe in ghosts, Maester?"" he asked Qyburn.

&gt;The man's face grew strange. ""Once, at the Citadel, I came into an empty room and saw an empty chair. Yet I knew a woman had been there, only a moment before. The cushion was dented where she'd sat, the cloth was still warm, and her scent lingered in the air. If we leave our smells behind us when we leave a room, surely something of our souls must remain when we leave this life?"" Qyburn spread his hands. ""The archmaesters did not like my thinking, though. **Well, Marwyn did, but he was the only one.**"" -ASOS, Jaime VII

Even though we find out that Qyburn does blood magic/rides with Braves Companions quite early in the story, he not only seems to help Jaime, but is also considered not-threatening and almost fatherly. Later he starts doing blood magic for Cersei resulting in Robert Strong/unGregor.

***

#Other Characters He Could Have Met

We also get this passage about Marwyn:

&gt;**When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown, after spending eight years in the east mapping distant lands, searching for lost books, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders**, Vinegar Vaellyn had dubbed him ""Marwyn the Mage."" The name was soon all over Oldtown, to Vaellyn's vast annoyance. ""Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths a man can trust in,"" Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pate, but Ryam's ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and his maester's chain had no link of Valyrian steel. -AFFC, Prologue

***

**Pyat Pree**

If Marlock spent 8 years in the east, it is likely that he stopped in Qarth, where the headquarters of the warlocks is (House of the Undying). 

That said warlocks are known to exist in Asshai as well:

&gt;The dark city by the Shadow is a city steeped in sorcery. **Warlocks**, wizards, alchemists, moonsingers, red priests, black alchemists, necromancers, aeromancers, pyromancers, bloodmages, torturers, inquisitors, poisoners, godswives, night-walkers, shapechangers, worshippers of the Black Goat and the Pale Child and the Lion of Night, all find welcome in Asshai-by-the-Shadow, where nothing is forbidden. Here they are free to practice their spells without restraint or censure, conduct their obscene rites, and fornicate with demons if that is their desire. -TWOIAF: The Bone and Beyond: Asshai-by-the-Shadow

It also should be noted that warlocks from Qarth were hired to come ""cure"" Sam of his cowardice:

&gt;""One time,"" Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, ""two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn't make me brave as they'd promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged."" -AGOT, Jon IV

Im assuming that these warlocks had to pass through Oldtown to get to Horn Hill (although its possible Marwyn was gone).

But again, like Mirri and Qyburn, Pyat (while creepy) does seem to initially ""help"" Dany before turning on her and later being captured by Euron (along with 3 other warlocks of which 3 of them are forced to result to eating one of the others)

***

**Quaithe**

As we only know of two shadowbinders currently (Mel/Quaithe) its possible that Marwyn has met Quaithe. Especially since they both have glass candles:

&gt;""What feeds a dragon's fire?"" Marwyn seated himself upon a stool. ""All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood or fire. **The sorcerers of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and deserts with one of these glass candles. They could enter a man's dreams and give him visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before their candles.** Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?"" -AFFC, Samwell V

Marwyn has been to Asshai and possibly Qarth, and these are two locations that we know that Quaithe has been before. 

Like Pyat Pree, its possible that Quaithe and her initial ""advice"" could later turn to dust and she could be an actual ""enemy"". So far her only agenda that seems to have been given is:

&gt; If you have some warning for me, speak plainly. What do you want of me, Quaithe?

&gt;**To show you the way.** -ADWD, Daenerys II 

***

As we don't have much evidence, the odds aren't super high, but I thought that the way the other encounters went down that Marwyn could have run into these characters as well. Let me know what you think, as I can't wait to see what happens once Marwyn arrives in Meereen and/or has an encounter with Quaithe.

**TLDR: It is possible that in addition to Mirri Maz Duur and Qyburn that Marwyn has encountered both Pyat Pree and Quaithe.**",asoiaf,Potential Characters From Marwyn's Past (Spoilers Extended)
1996,"Winterfell is said to have been built by Brandon the Builder, along with the Wall, Storm's End, and possibly the High Tower in Oldtown.

Brandon the Builder was almost certainly a Child of the Forest:

&gt;Some said the children of the forest helped him build it, shaping the stones with magic; others claimed that a small boy told him what he must do, a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder.  
Catelyn III - AGOT

A boy... In truth, a Child, my dear Cat. A Child of the Forest!

I believe weirwoods are much more than just trees, and much more than mere vessels for whatever collective consciousness absorbs Varamyr in ADWD, and that they can morph into stone structures (or ice structures in the case of the Wall).

I believe that the Children of the Forest (CotF) are able to manipulate the weirwood trees and make them change shape, turning them into stone structures. Winterfell is one of these structures:

&gt;The place had grown over the centuries **like some monstrous stone tree**, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.  
Bran II - AGOT

Most people think that Winterfell has some kind of advanced geothermal heating system, trusting the opinion of Catelyn:

&gt;Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep, Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.  
Catelyn II - AGOT

But what does Cat know of Winterfell and the North - or about anything else, for that matter?

Her son Brandon, whom she raised and who was educated by maester Luwin (a southerner who openly dismisses the Old Gods, the CotF, and any form of magic), believes that the pools in the godswood are heated by some mysterious hot spring:

&gt;Across the godswood, beneath the windows of the Guest House, an underground hot spring fed three small ponds. Steam rose from the water day and night, and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss. Hodor hated cold water, and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool and sit for hours, giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface.  
Bran VI - AGOT

Oh Bran, sweet summer child, what do you know about hot springs and weirwood trees?

This quote is the only evidence of any supposed volcanic activity in Winterfell. There's no dragonglass, no volcano, not even a mountain in the surrounding area. Is the volcanic activity in Winterfell strictly subterranean? That's not how it works in the real world.

Strangely enough, this supposed ""hot spring"" only affects the three pools beneath the Guest House, not the pool that lies in front of the heart tree in the godswood:

&gt;At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold.  
Catelyn I - AGOT

How can this be? The pool in front of the heart tree is not that far from the Guest House (check out the countless maps of Winterfell on the interwebs). Why is this pool cold, when the others are steaming hot?

My guess is that there's no hot spring at all, and that it's the weirwood that is Winterfell that is heating the pools in front of the Guest House. The pool in front of the heart tree is never warm because it's too far from the stone structures.

It is implied that it may become steaming hot when Theon receives a telepathic communication from Bran:

&gt;In the godswood the snow was still dissolving as it touched the earth. Steam rose off the hot pools, fragrant with the smell of moss and mud and decay. A warm fog hung in the air, turning the trees into sentinels, tall soldiers shrouded in cloaks of gloom. During daylight hours, the steamy wood was often full of northmen come to pray to the old gods, but at this hour Theon Greyjoy found he had it all to himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;And in the heart of the wood the weirwood waited with its knowing red eyes. Theon stopped by the edge of the pool and bowed his head before its carved red face. Even here he could hear the drumming, *boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM.* Like distant thunder, the sound seemed to come from everywhere at once.  
&gt;  
&gt;The night was windless, the snow drifting straight down out of a cold black sky, yet the leaves of the heart tree were rustling his name. “Theon,” they seemed to whisper, “Theon.”  
A Ghost in Winterfell – ADWD

Is the pool in front of the heart tree also steaming, like the other three beneath the Guest House? The text is ambiguous here. If so, then it's possible that the pool in front of the heart tree is steaming because of a surge in weirwood activity, caused by Bran telepathically communicating with Theon.

It is also very possible that the heat in Blood Raven's cave is caused by the weirwood roots:

&gt;After the bone-grinding cold of the lands beyond the Wall, the caves were blessedly warm, and when the chill crept out of the rock the singers would light fires to drive it off again.  
Bran III - ADWD

GRRM introduces the unusual heat in the cave, and gives us a plausible explanation in the next breath. But the tinfoil explanation (i.e. the correct one) would be that the caves are full of weirwood roots:

&gt;The roots were everywhere, twisting through earth and stone, closing off some passages and holding up the roofs of others.  
Bran II - ADWD

and that it's actually these roots that might cause the cave to be ""blessedly warm"". Note the language: the warmth is a ""blessing"", meaning it has a religious origin, meaning it comes from the Old Gods (the weirwood trees).

The Black Gate, the weirwood tree that lies at the base of the Wall, is also stangely warm:

&gt;The door’s upper lip brushed softly against the top of Bran’s head, and a drop of water fell on him and ran slowly down his nose. **It was strangely warm, and salty as a tear.**  
Bran IV – ASOS

How can there be warmth at the Black Gate? It lies at the base of a gigantic ice structure, in the coldest part of the known world. The only logical explanation is that it's the weirwood that's producing heat. And it produces heat because it's constantly producing ice to maintain the shape of the Wall!!!

There are also some parallels between Blood Raven's cave and the crypts of Winterfell:

&gt;On either side of them, in niches carved from the stone, skulls looked down on them. Bran saw a bear skull and a wolf skull, half a dozen human skulls and near as many giants. All the rest were small, queerly formed. Children of the forest. The roots had grown in and around and through them, every one.  
Bran II -ADWD

These skulls in ""niches carved from stone"" on either side of the passage parallel the stone statues of the Kings of Winter aligned in the crypts of Winterfell (they also parallel the Hall of Faces in the House of Black and White...).

My theory is that the bones of the Kings of Winter were given as a sacrifice to the mouth of the weirwood tree that probably lies in the lower levels of the crypts (just like the Black Gate), and that these statues are actually somehow made by the tree, not carved by some sculptor. This would explain the statue of Lyanna, whose bones were given as a sacrifice by Ned for some mysterious reason (what the hell really happened to her anyway?), and also why Lady Dustin wanted to check out the crypts: she wanted to make sure that Ned's bones hadn't been given to the weirwood, and check whether it was only a ""real"" statue of Ned (the one carved in ACOK under Luwyn's orders), not a magical one.

&gt;“Ned Stark returned the horse to me on his way back home to Winterfell. He told me that my lord had died an honorable death, that his body had been laid to rest beneath the red mountains of Dorne. He brought his sister’s bones back north, though, and there she rests … but I promise you, Lord Eddard’s bones will never rest beside hers. I mean to feed them to my dogs.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Theon did not understand. “His … his bones … ?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Her lips twisted. It was an ugly smile, a smile that reminded him of Ramsay’s. “Catelyn Tully dispatched Lord Eddard’s bones north before the Red Wedding, but your iron uncle seized Moat Cailin and closed the way. I have been watching ever since. Should those bones ever emerge from the swamps, they will get no farther than Barrowton.” She threw one last lingering look at the likeness of Eddard Stark. “We are done here.”  
The Turncloak - ADWD

Remember that Jon finds bones in the mouth of the ww tree at Whitetree in ACOK. There's clearly some unknown religious ritual involving bones, weirwoods, and afterlife that has yet to be revealed. Also remember that the statues of the Kings of Winter are constantly described as being ""alive"" or ""staring"" - just like the Wall is alive, Storm's End repairs itself, and Winterfell grows. 

Living statues are a recurring time in the story, like with the statue in Illyrio's garden:

&gt;A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo's blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.

And Shireen thinks that the stone dragons of Dragonstone will come to life:

&gt;“I had bad dreams,” Shireen told him. “About the dragons. They were coming to eat me.” The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. “We have talked of this before,” he said gently. “The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child... A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fear-some, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations.”  
Prologue - ACOK

Assuming I'm right about Winterfell and the Wall, could Dragonstone be made on the same model? We know that the maesters are almost always wrong when it comes to distant history...

The show weirdly takes us to hidden caves on Dragonstone, only to tell us that the island was once inhabited by the CotF. Is there a weirwood in the depths of Dragonstone? And does the ""wake dragons out of stone"" from the Azor Ahai prophecy mean that all these statues can somehow come back to life?

And, still assuming I'm right about all this, what kind of creatures were the gargoyles of Winterfell and Dragonstone? Where did they come from, if they were somehow produce by a weirwood tree after some unknown magical ritual? Are they the demons unleashed on the planet by the Lion of Night when he caused the Long Night?

The gargoyles of Winterfell are probably among the oldest parts of the castle:

&gt;Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep

1997,"I have been thinking a lot about the future of my favorite character and I came up with something that sound like a potentially fitting and exciting path for Theon Greyjoy in the next book.

Right now Theon is a prisoner of Stannis but in the show after escaping Winterfell he goes to the Iron Islands for a Kingsmoot and then goes to Meereen to bring Dany to Westeros.  I the books the Kingsmoot has happened already and Victarion is going to bring ships to Dany not Theon.  Since I am sure Theon will not be executed by Stannis or continue to be a fly on the wall since he needs his own story to continue his arc . This will be the first time this new Theon gets to do something of his choice and my idea is that Theon goes beyond the wall and helps to bring Bran back to Winterfell. This makes sense for a few reasons

1. Bran has already been communicating with Theon through the gods wood in Winterfell and then the raven in Theon's sample chapter so it feels like their stories will be related going forward and there is a precedent for Bran to be able to talk to Theon.
2. Theon almost killed Bran so having him save him feels like a great way for Theon to continue to redeem himself. 
3. Bran's story seems to be heading in the direction (Thematically) of returning to Winterfell.
4. George R.R. Martin said Hold the door will still happen just in a different context and that means it is likely that Meera will need to be the one to drag Bran through zombie infested forests that it took Hodor a long time to get through. So Meera will need some help.
5. Most of Theon's season 6 and 7 stuff has been passed off to Victarion and Asha so he is open to start a new plotline
6. In season 7 there is a mission beyond the wall that doesn't make very much sense but ended with the wall coming down. Sam and Victarion both have horns with them that could potentially result in a way for Euron to destroy the wall if Sam's is in fact Joramun's (it might not be). So since show Euron is very different, and they don't need that mission to destroy the wall, I think it is possible the show runners changed the purpose of the beyond the wall mission to make up for changes to the plot, and in the books Theon led the last mission beyond the wall to bring Bran back south                            

&amp;#x200B;

This also gives a chance for a storyline with currently uninvolved characters like Alliser Thorne, any nights watchmen at the wall, some of the wildlings, or even my two favorite options Benjen Stark or Mance Rayder. It would be amazing to see Theon with a Stark who doesn't know what he did and I currently don't see Mance's role in Winds so he both knows the north and could know how important Bran might be to stopping the others, but that is just a crazy hope wanting two of my favorite characters to be together in the next book.                                                                                      

Ill admit there is almost nothing to back this up text wise it just feels like it makes sense Thematically for Bran or even Blood Raven to give Theon a vision at the heart tree and then for Theon, the one who drove Bran out of Winterfell to be the one to bring him home. 

This is my first post ever and Its just a kind of out there prediction but I think it makes sense for a few reasons and most importantly would be pretty cool. I would love to hear peoples thoughts and see if others have thought of this type of thing too. Either way I can't wait to see for sure whenever Winds comes out.",asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) A Prediction for (Spoiler)'s Role in The Winds of Winter
