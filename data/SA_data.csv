3,"I'm at the part when bridge 4 starts using parshendi bones and armor to attract the attention of enemy archers because Kaladin knows it'll piss them off. 

The tactic seems incongruous with Kaladins high standard of honor. He is blatantly abusing something he knows to be sacred to another group of peoples. He saw Shen's crying when he first tried it, and the extreme retaliation of the Parshendi archers. 

Seems inconsistent to me. Anyone else agree? Thoughts?",Stormlight_Archive,[Spoilers book 1] question about some tactics...

7,"As the title says, I just want acknowledge how these books have helped me. 

One example that comes to mind is how I resonated deeply with Sazed's own devastating loss of faith in God and religion in Mistborn, as I went through my own worldview change and faith transition. 

Another involves a terrible opioid addiction I developed over the last year. For a long time I felt deep shame and couldn't muster up the strength to ask for help. It was after reading about Dalinar's encounter with Odium and his willingness to abandon the thrill that I found the courage to get help. I saw my drug use as a way to numb my emotional pain, and Dalinar gave me the strength to say to my addiction, ""you cannot have my pain"" anymore. Teft similarly provided a character I felt I could relate deeply to.  I am now exactly 4 weeks sober, to this day. The most important step I can take is the next one.  

Often when I read about the ideals I feel strengthened. Death is the destination of all men; my path to death matters more than the destination. 

So thank you Brandon. I have felt more inspired to change for good in these simple yet profound books than I ever did reading Christian scriptural texts.  

As a caveat -- no offense is meant to those who do find meaning and purpose from scripture -- I recognize there is a large Mormon fanbase. Just wanted to describe my own experience.",Stormlight_Archive,"I grew up in Utah as a Mormon (same state and religion as Branderson Sanderson). I no longer believe in the religion I was raised in, yet I have to admit that Brandon's books--Stormlight in particular--have been more inspirational to me than any scripture, and helped me overcome an opioid addiction."

14,"I'm on my 3rd reread/listen and I wondering why we haven't heard about a long tradition of assassinations for Shard Blades. As a Harry Potter reader; one of the big themes was the Elder Wand and how their owners would be killed, mainly by knifes in the dark.  Now in Roshar we have Blades that are worth Kingdoms (mentioned frequently) and state that the means that a Blade was aquired is meaningless (stated most notably in Oarhbringer when talking to Roshone.)

So my question is why isn't assassination not a common thing?  Seems like bodyguards would have a strong reason to slip a knife into Shardholder why they sleep and run off with the spoils. Storms the Blade makes them lighteyes. Seems like it would be easy to make a new life with the change in status. You wouldn't even have to use the blade for battle.

I can’t remember which chapter it is, but right near the start of the book Dalinar observes The Lopen with his regrown arm and comments on how their abilities stopped once Kaladin left for Hearthstone. 

So what happens when, in the middle of a big crazy battle, the Radiant tied to these squires gets killed? I’m assuming they’d lose their abilities once the Radiant is killed, potentially turning the tide of battle, leaving the squires to plummet to the earth to their death. 

Maybe Kaladin gets got in book 4, the rest or a good chunk of his squires subsequently lose their abilities and it potentially decimates Dalinar’s army and their ability to fight?",Stormlight_Archive,A thought on Windrunners/Skybreakers and their squires
20,"For the longest time, I was upset with Sanderson as I felt that when he came onto the Wheel of Time books, the quality/writing had dipped(personal opinion). But I got over that and gave him a chance.

I read the first two books in the Reckoner's series and enjoyed them. Any book that tackles powers in a unique way will always have my interest. After which I decided to give Mistborn a try. Oh man, I couldn't seem to get into that, but granted I never got far. 

I was looking for more content that handled powers in a unique/interesting way and people kept recommending this series to me, most everyone saying that it was a superhero book within a fantasy setting.

This may just be a preference thing, but the point is that with about 10 bajillion other things that I need to get around to reading / watching / playing / doing, I don't think I'd seek out his other works just based on the strength of his writing, but I'm invested in the plot and would happily dig into other stuff if it had a meaningful impact on this story. 

So, does the Cosmere stuff add more nuance to Stormlight? Is it just thematic connectivity / way the world operates, or are there revelations about the universe that recontextualize how I might understand fundamental aspects of Stormlight? 

I liken this to reading LOTR then reading The Silmarillion, then never being able to read LOTR the same way again because tales like Turin, Beren &amp; Luthien, the Fall of Gondolin, and the destruction of Numenor echo throughout LOTR.

I've got a few questions and thoughts that may have been obvious and I've missed or maybe have been addressed in WoBs or might still be mysteries, looking for some help sorting these. 


1 - Azure's blade isn't a shard as other shards are and I think it's kind of obvious it's another awakened blade? Like Nightblood. Does anyone have any thoughts or theories on the awakening command that could have been used? 

2 - how long is meant to be between WB and WoK? I reckon it must have been a substantial amount of time as Zahiel trained adolin so must have been in service of the kholinars for a while to be trusted with that. 

3- With this in mind I think it's also pretty obvious that Vivienne is now returned? 

4 - Meaning she's at least a level 5 on the Biochromatic breath scale but do we know if her or Zahiel are actually higher levels? My thoughts behind this is they'll both need a breath a week to survive so must have a stock pile? 

5 - does anyone have any theories on the arc that will see Vivienne vasher and NB reunited or how the different abilities will come into play?

## Exclusive Fiction: Opening of Stormlight Four

I read about half of this chapter at a convention somewhere, I believe, but the full version has never been seen. It’s what will likely be the first chapter of Stormlight Four, which (hopefully) will come out next Christmastime.

I’ll warn you though, it’s an early draft—and is likely to have not only errors like awkward language, but the occasional continuity problem as well. It also spoils a ton from earlier books. But with those warnings in place, here is chapter one of the next book in the Stormlight Archive.

### Chapter One of Stormlight Four

*First, you must get a spren to approach.*

*The type of gemstone is relevant to this, as some spren are naturally more intrigued by certain gemstones. More importantly, it is essential to provide the spren with something it knows and loves. The spren must be made to feel calm. A good fire for a flamespren, for example, is a must.*

—Lecture on Fabrial Mechanics as presented by Navani Kholin to the Coalition of Monarchs, Urithiru.

Lirin was impressed at how calm he felt as he checked the child’s gums for scurvy. Years of training as a surgeon served him well today. Breathing exercises—intended to keep his hands steady—worked just as well for harboring fugitives as they did for surgery.

“Here,” he said to the child’s mother, digging from his pocket a small carved carapace chit. “Show this to woman at the dining pavilion. She’ll get you some juice for your son. Make certain he drinks it all, each morning.”

“Very thank you,” the woman said in a thick Herdazian accent. She gathered her son close, then looked to Lirin with haunted eyes. “If . . . if child . . . found . . .”

“I will make certain you’re notified if we hear word of your other children,” Lirin promised. “I’m sorry for your loss.”

She nodded, wiped her cheeks, and carried the child toward the town. The morning fog obscured Hearthstone, so from the outside, it seemed a group of dark, shadowy lumps. Like tumors. Lirin could barely make out the tarps stretched between buildings, offering meager shelter for the many refugees pouring out of Herdaz. Entire streets were closed off, and phantom sounds—plates clinking, people talking—rose through the fog.

Those shanties would never last a storm, of course, but could be quickly torn down and stowed. There just wasn’t enough housing otherwise. He glanced at the line of those waiting for admittance today. Storms. How many more could the town hold? The villages closer to the border must be filled to capacity, if so many were making their way to Hearthstone.

It had been over a year since the coming of the Everstorm and the fall of Alethkar. A year during which the country of Herdaz—Alethkar’s small cousin to the north west—had somehow kept fighting. Two months ago, the enemy had finally decided to crush Herdaz for good, and that’s when the refugees had started appearing. Like usual, the soldiers fought while the common people—their fields trampled—starved and were forced out of their homes, looking to escape the conflict.

Hearthstone did what it could. Aric and the other men—once guards at Roshone’s mansion, now forbidden weapons—organized the line and kept anyone from sneaking into town before Lirin saw them. He had persuaded Brightness Abijan that it was essential he see each refugee and judge if they’d bring dangerous diseases into the city. More, he wanted to intercept those who might need treatment.

The woman he’d just seen carried her child up to the watch post outside of town. Here, a group of armed parshmen lifted her hood and compared her face to drawings that had been sent by the fused. Hessica, Lirin’s wife, stood nearby to read the descriptions as required. She was one of the few women in the city who could read, though Brightness Abijan and several of the other parshwomen were learning quickly in their lessons.

Parshmen carrying swords. Learning to read. Even a year after their awakening, Lirin found the notions odd. But really, what was it to him? In some ways, little had changed, despite the coming of the Everstorm and the awakening of the parshmen. The skin was different, but the same old conflicts consumed them as easily as they had the Alethi brightlords. People who got a taste of power wanted more, then sought it with the sword. Normal people bled, and Lirin had to try to put them back together.

He turned back to his line of waiting refugees. He still had at least a hundred to give medical assessments to today. Hiding among them was one in particular, a specific refugee. In some ways, that man was the author of all this suffering.

It wasn’t, however, the next person in line. That was a ragged man who had lost an arm in battle. The wound was a few months old at this point, and there was nothing that Lirin could do about the extensive scarring.

Lirin held up his finger and moved it back and forth before the man’s face, watching his eyes track it. *Shock,* Lirin thought. “Have you suffered recent wounds you’re not telling me about?”

“No wounds,” the man whispered. “But brigands . . . they took my wife, good surgeon. Took her . . . left me tied to a tree. Just walked off, laughing . . .”

Bother. Mental shock wasn’t something he could cut out with a scalpel. “Once you enter the town,” Lirin said, “look for tent fourteen. Tell the women there I sent you.”

The man nodded dully, though his stare was hollow. Had he even registered the words? Memorizing the man’s description—graying hair with a cowlick in the back, three large moles on the upper left cheek, and of course the missing arm—Lirin made note to check at tent fourteen for him later tonight. He had assistants there watching refugees who might turn suicidal. It was, with so many to care for, the best he could manage.

“On with you,” Lirin said, gently pushing the man toward the town. “Tent fourteen. Don’t forget. I’m sorry for your loss.”

The man walked off.

“You say it so easily, surgeon,” a voice said from behind Lirin.

Lirin stood and turned with surprise, then immediately bowed in respect. Abijan, the new citylord, was a parshwoman with stark white skin and fine red swirls on her cheeks.

“Brightness,” Lirin said. “What was that?”

“You told that man,” Abijan said, “you were sorry for his loss. You say it so easily to each of them—but you seem to have the compassion of a stone. Do you feel, surgeon, for these people?”

“I feel, Brightness,” Lirin said, “but I must be careful not to be overwhelmed by their pains. It’s one of the first rules of becoming a surgeon.”

“Curious.” The parshwoman raised her safehand, which was shrouded in the sleeve of a havah. “Do you remember setting my arm when I was a child?”

“I do.”

“Such a curious memory,” she said. “That life feels like a dream to me now. I remember pain. Confusion. A stern figure, bringing me more pain—though I now recognize you were simply seeking to heal me. So much trouble to go through for a slave child.”

“I have never cared who I heal, Brightness. Slave or king.”

“I’m sure the fact that Wistiow had paid good money for me had nothing to do with it.” She narrowed her eyes at Lirin, and when she next spoke, there was a cadence to her words . . . as if she were speaking the words to a song. “Did you feel for me, the poor, confused slave child whose mind had been stolen from her? Did you weep for us, surgeon, and the life we led?”

“A surgeon must not weep,” Lirin said softly. “A surgeon cannot *afford* to weep.”

“Like a stone,” she said again, then shook her head. “Have you seen any plaguespren on these refugees? If those spren get into the city, it could kill everyone.”

“Diseases isn’t caused by spren,” Lirin said. “It is spread by contaminated water, improper sanitation, or sometimes by the breath of those who bear it.”

“Superstition,” she said.

“The wisdom of the Heralds,” Lirin replied. “We should be careful.” Fragments of old manuscripts—translations of translations of translations—spoke of ancient diseases that had killed thousands, spreading quickly and persistently. Such things hadn’t been recorded in any modern texts he’d been read, but he *had* heard rumors of something strange to the west—a new plague, they were calling it. Details were sparse.

Abijan moved on without further complaint at him. Her attendants—a group of elevated parshmen and parshwomen—joined her. Though their clothing was of Alethi cuts and fashion, the colors were lighter, more muted, than human women might wear. The fused had explained that singers in the past eschewed bright colors, as to not distract from their skin patterns.

He sensed a search for identity in the way Abijan and the other parshmen acted. Their accents, their dress, their mannerisms—they were all distinctly Alethi. But they grew transfixed whenever the fused said about the lives of their ancestors, and tried whenever they could to emulate those long dead parshmen. Or, eln-singers they were being called. Old singers, in their language. Contrasted with the niv-singers, the modern punch of parshmen who had awakened.

Lirin turned to the next group of refugees—a complete family for once. Though he should have been happy to see that, he couldn’t help wondering how difficult it was going to be to feed five children and parents who were flagging from poor nutrition.

As he sent them on, a familiar figure moved down the line toward him. Laral wore a simple servant’s dress now, with a gloved hand instead of a sleeve, and she carried a water bucket. Ostensibly, she was giving water to the waiting refugees. Laral didn’t walk like a servant, though. There was a certain . . . determination about the young woman that no forced subservience could smother. The end of the world itself seemed roughly as bothersome to her as a poor harvest once had.

She paused by Lirin, offering him a drink. Ladled into a fresh cup, rather than taken straight from the bucket, as he insisted.

“He’s three down,” Laral whispered as Lirin sipped.

Lirin grunted.

“Shorter than I expected him to be,” Laral noted. “He’s supposed to be a great general, leader of the Herdazian resistance. He looks more like a traveling merchant.”

“Genius comes in all shapes, Laral,” Lirin said, waving for another drink to give an excuse for them to keep talking.

“Still . . .” she said, then fell silent as Durnash passed by, a tall Parshman with marbled black and red skin, a sword on his back. Once he was well on his way, she continued softly. “I’m honestly surprised at you, Lirin. Not even once have you suggested we turn in this hidden general.”

“He’d be executed,” Lirin said.

“You think him as a criminal though, don’t you?”

“Criminal? I’m not sure. He bears a terrible responsibility for certain; he perpetuated a war against an overwhelming enemy force. He threw away the lives of his men in a hopeless battle.”

“Some would call that heroism.”

“Heroism is a myth you tell idealistic young people—specifically when you want them to go bleed for you. It got my son killed and my other son taken from me. You can keep your heroism and give me back the lives of those wasted on foolish conflicts.”

At least it seemed to almost be over. Now that the resistance in Herdaz had finally collapsed, the fused had secured dominance of the country, like they had Alethkar. Hopefully, the refugee flood would slow now, and everything could settle back down.

Laral watched him with those blue eyes of hers. She was a keen one. How he wished life had gone another direction; that old Wistiow had held on a few more years. Lirin might, in that case, call this woman daughter, and have both of his sons beside him—with Kaladin trained to be a surgeon, not a killer.

“I won’t turn him in,” Lirin said, looking away from Laral’s questioning gaze. “Stop looking at me like that. I hate war, but I won’t condemn your hero.”

“And your son will come fetch him soon?”

“We’ve sent him word. That should be enough. Just be sure your husband is ready with his distraction.”

She nodded and moved on to offer water to the parshmen guards at the city entrance. Lirin got through the next few refugees quickly, and then moved on to a group of cloaked figures.

He calmed himself with the quick breathing exercise his master had taught him in the surgery room all those years ago. So it was that though his insides were a storm, his hands didn’t shake as he waved forward the first of the men.

“I will need to do an inspection,” Lirin said softly, “to not make it seem so unusual when I pull you out of the line.”

“Begin with me,” said the shortest of the men as he stepped forward. The other four shifted their positions, placing themselves carefully around him.

“Don’t look so much like you’re guarding him, you fools,” Lirin hissed. “Here, sit down on the ground. Maybe you’ll seem less like a gang of thugs that way.”

They did as requested, and Lirin pulled over his stool, settling down beside the shortest of the men. He bore a thin mustache on his upper lip, silvered to grey, and was perhaps in his fifties. His sun-leathered skin was darker than most Herdazians; he almost could have passed for Azish. His eyes were a cool, soft green.

“You’re him?” Lirin whispered as he put his ear to the man’s chest to check his heartbeat.

“I am,” the man said.

Dieno enne Calah. Dieno “The Mink” in Old Herdazian. Hessica explained that enne was a very specific kind of honorific—with an implied “greatness” to the wording.

One might have expected—as Laral apparently had—the Mink to be a brutal warrior cast from the same forge as men Like Dalinar Kholin or Meridas Amaram. Lirin, however, knew that killers came in all kinds of packages. The Mink might be short, and might be missing a tooth, but there was a power to his lean build, and Lirin spotted not a few scars in his inspection. Those around the wrists, in fact . . . those were the scars manacles made on the skin of slaves, if worn too long.

“Thank you,” Dieno said as Lirin continued his inspection, “for offering us refuge.”

“It wasn’t my choice,” Lirin said.

“Still, you ensure that the resistance will escape to live on. Heralds bless you, surgeon.”

Lirin dug out a bandage, then began wrapping a wound on the man’s arm that hadn’t been seen to properly. “The heralds bless us with a quick end to this conflict.”

“Yes, with the invaders sent running all the way back to the Damnation from which they were spawned.”

Lirin continued his work.

“You . . . disagree, surgeon?”

“Your resistance has failed, general,” Lirin said, pulling the bandage tight. “Your kingdom has fallen, like my own. Further conflict will just leave more men dead.”

“Surely you don’t intend to just obey these monsters.”

“I obey the person who holds the sword to my neck, general,” Lirin said. “Same as I always have.”

He finished his exam, then did cursory looks over the general’s four companions. Now women. How would the general read messages sent to him?

Lirin made a show of discovering a wound on one man’s leg, and—with a little coaching—the man limped on it properly, then let out a painful howl.

“That will need surgery,” Lirin said loudly. “Or you might lose the leg. No, no complaints. We’re going to see to that right now.”

He had Aric—one of the town’s former guards—fetch a litter. Positioning the other four soldiers, general included, as bearers for that litter gave Lirin an excuse to pull them all out of line.

Now they just needed the distraction. It came in the form of Toralin Roshone. The former citylord stumbled out of the town—at this distance through the fog, he was just a dark figure that wobbled on unsteady feet.

Lirin waved to the Mink and his soldiers, slowly leading them toward the inspection post.

“You aren’t armed, are you?” he hissed under his breath.

“We left obvious weapons behind,” the mink replied, “but it will be my face—and not our arms—that betrays us.”

“We’ve prepared for that.” *Pray to the almighty it works.*

As Lirin drew near, he could better make out Roshone through the fog. The former citylord’s skin hung in deflated jowls these days, still reflecting the weight he’d lost following his son’s death some six years ago. Roshone been ordered to shave his beard, perhaps because he’d been fond of it, and he no longer wore his proud warrior’s takama. That had been replaced by the knee pads and worker’s garb of a crem scraper.

He carried a stool under one arm and muttered to himself in a slurred voice. Despite a lifetime treating drunks who had suffered a fall or a fight, Lirin honestly couldn’t tell if Roshone had gotten himself drunk for the display, or if he was faking. He drew attention either way. The parshmen manning the inspection post nudged one another, and one hummed to an up-beat rhythm—something they often did when amused.

Roshone picked a building nearby and set down his stool, then—to the delight of the watching parshmen—tried stepping up on it, but missed and stumbled and nearly fell.

They loved watching him. Most of the parshmen in Hearthstone these days hadn’t been owned by Roshone—Abijan and three others were unique in that regard. But every one of these niv-singers *had* been owned by one wealthy lighteyes or another. Watching the former citylord reduced to a stumbling drunk who spent his days doing the most menial job in the city? To them, it was more captivating than any storyteller’s performance.

Lirin stepped up with his charges. “This one needs immediate surgery,” he said, gesturing to the man in the litter. “If I don’t get to him now, he might lose the foot.”

Of the three parshmen assigned as inspectors, only Dor bothered to check the “wounded” man’s face against the drawings.

The Mink was top of the list of dangerous refugees, but Dor didn’t spare a glance for the bearers of the litters. He simply held up the drawings and went through a few of them, comparing them to the man in the litter. Lirin had noticed the oddity a few days back—when he used refugees from the line as labor, the inspectors often fixated only on the person in the litter.

He’d hoped that, with Roshone to provide entertainment, the parshmen would be even more lax. Still, Lirin felt himself sweating as Dor hesitated on one of the pictures. He’d told the Mink to only bring only low-level guards, who wouldn’t be on the lists. Could it still—

The other two parshmen laughed at Roshone, who was trying—despite his drunkenness—to reach the roof of the building and scrape away the crem build up there. Dor turned and joined them, absently waving Lirin forward.

Lirin shared a brief look with his wife, who waited nearby. It was a good thing none of the parshmen were looking at her, because she looked pale as a shin man. Lirin probably didn’t look much better, but he held in his sigh of relief as he waved the Mink and his soldiers forward. He could sequester them inside the surgery room, keep them away from the public eye until—

“Everyone stop what you’re doing!” a female voice shouted from behind. “Prepare to give deference!”

Lirin felt an immediate urge to bolt. He almost did it, but the soldiers simply kept walking at an even pace. Yes, that was much better. Pretend that you hadn’t heard, or that the order didn’t apply to you.

“You, surgeon!” the voice shouted at him. It was Abijan. Reluctantly, Lirin stopped, excuses running through his mind. Would she believe he hadn’t realized who this was? Lirin was already in rough winds with the citylady after insisting on treating Jeber’s wounds after the fool had gotten himself strung up and whipped.

Lirin turned around, trying very hard to still his nerves. Abijan hurried up, and though singers didn’t blush, she was obviously flustered. When she spoke, her words had adopted a staccato cadence. “Attend me,” she said. “We have a visitor.”

It took Lirin a moment to process the words. She wasn’t demanding an explanation or ordering he be taken. This was about . . . something else?

“What’s wrong, Brightness?” he asked.

Nearby, the Mink and his soldiers stopped in place, but Lirin could see their arms shifting beneath cloaks. They’d said they’d left behind “obvious” weapons. Almighty help him, if this turned bloody . . .

“Nothing’s wrong,” Abijan said, speaking quickly. “We’ve been blessed. Attend me.” She looked to Dor and the inspectors. “Pass the word. Nobody is to enter or leave the town until I give word otherwise.”

“Brightness,” Lirin said, gesturing toward the man in the litter. “This man’s wound may not look dire, but I’m certain that if I don’t go to immediate surgery, he—”

“It will wait.” She pointed to the Mink and his men. “You five, wait. Everyone just *wait.* All right. Wait and . . . and you, surgeon, come with me.”

She turned and strode away, expecting Lirin to follow. He met the eyes of the Mink, nodded for him to wait, then hurried after the citylady. What could have put her so out of sorts? She’d been so obviously practicing a regal air lately, but had now abandoned it completely.

Lirin crossed the field outside of town, walking alongside the line of still-waiting refugees, and soon found his answer. A hulking figure, easily seven feet tall, emerged from the fog, accompanied by a small squad of niv-singers with weapons. The dreadful creature had long red hair—the color of dried blood, thicker than human hair—and jagged carapace to match. The face was almost pure black, with lines of marbled red under the eyes.

One of the fused. In Hearthstone. It had been months since Lirin had seen one—and that had only been in passing as a small group had stopped on the way to the battlefront in Herdaz. That group had soared through the air in breezy robes, bearing spears longer than a battlefield pike.

They had evoked an ethereal beauty, but this creature looked far more wicked—like something one might *expect* to have come from Damnation. The creature wore a tight black outfit, seemingly of a long piece of cloth that had been wound between its outcroppings of armor. A strange pair of carapace fins, like rising wings, broke its long hair at the sides of its head, above its ears. Lirin couldn’t remember ever seeing a parshman—or a Fused—with those horn-like protrusions.

The eyes glowed a deep, dangerous red. The fused spoke in a rhythmic language, and a smaller—more mundane parshwoman in battle carapace—stepped forward to translate. From what Lirin had heard, many of the Fused didn’t speak modern languages.

“You,” the interpreter said, “are the surgeon mentioned? You’ve been inspecting the people today?”

“Yes,” Lirin said.

The fused spoke, and again, the interpreter translated. “We are looking for a spy. He might be hidden among those you met today.”

Lirin felt his mouth go dry. The thing standing above him seemed not of this world, but of legends. A nightmare that should have *remained* a legend, a demon whispered of around the midnight fire. When Lirin tried to speak, the words just wouldn’t come out, and he had to cough to clear his throat.

At a barked word from the fused, the soldiers with him spread out to the line of refugees. Those backed away, and several tried to run, but the parshmen—though common beside the fused—wore bodies with fit energy and terrible speed. They caught runners while others began looking through the line, throwing back hoods and inspecting faces.

*Don’t look behind, at the Mink, Lirin. Don’t seem nervous.*

“We . . .” Lirin said. “We inspect at each person, comparing them to drawings given to us. I promise you. We’ve been watchful! No need to terrorize these poor refuges.”

Curiously, the interpreter didn’t translate Lirin’s words for the Fused. It seemed perfectly capable of understanding his tongue. Yet, when he spoke back, it used its own language.

“The one we seek is not on those lists,” the interpreter said. “He is a spy of the most dangerous kind. You saw each person today? We seek a young man. He would be fit and strong, compared to these refugees, though he might have feigned weakness.”

“That . . . that could describe any of a number of people,” Lirin said. Could he be in luck? Could this all be a coincidence? It might not be about the Mink at all. Lirin felt a moment of hope, like sunlight peeking through storm clouds.

“You would remember this man,” the interpreter said, translating as the fused spoke. “Tall for a human, with wavy black hair worn to the shoulders. Clean shaven, he would have had a slave’s brand on his head. Including the glyph *shash*.”

Slave’s brand.

*Shash*. Dangerous.

*Oh no* . . .

Nearby, one of the new parshman soldiers threw back the hood of a cloaked refugee—revealing a face that should have been intimately familiar to Lirin. And yet, the harsh man Kaladin had become looked like a crude drawing of the sensitive youth that Lirin remembered.

Kaladin immediately burst alight with power. Death had come to visit Hearthstone today, despite Lirin’s every effort.

\-Brandon",Stormlight_Archive,Stormlight Archive Book 4 Chapter 1
55,"A new Theme was added to the Stormlight Archives when we learned the truth about the Voidbringers.

We learned that the Humans of Roshar aren't the native people of Roshar... and that the Listeners are the native people of Roshar. This has turned the Stormlight Archive into a story about dealing with the fallout from Colonialism, which I refer to as a Post-Colonialism Narrative.

The Stormlight Archives isn't a story about fighting a World-Ending Evil. It's a story about accepting the Sins of your Forefathers, finding a way to live with your ancient enemies, and letting go of the Hatred that has built up over the century-long conflict.

From my perspective, this is an interesting narrative. It embraces the complex problems that come from Colonialism:

* The damage done to conquered peoples, and the cycle of violence that so easily follows.
* The inability of the Conquerors' descendants to just leave, because this is the only home they know.
* The guilt felt by those who benefit from the sins of the past, and can never really make things right.

I think it's a step past Anti-Colonial Literature. Instead of just looking at object lessons on why Colonialism is a bad thing, and how it ruins lives and destroys cultures... the Stormlight Archives tells the story of Colonialism that happened, and how people try to move forward.

With that basic argument made, I'm going to take a few paragraphs to comment on some Symbolism.

---

Brandon has been subtle about it, but each of the Non-Standard Listeners has a symbolic relationship to the effects that Colonization has upon a conquered people.

The Parshmen are a living symbol of the effect that Colonialism has upon a conquered people. Their Identities were quite literally destroyed by the Ancient Radiants during the False Desolation, stripping them of their free will and drive to act... but that was just the final blow. Their Cultural Identity was wiped away a long time ago. Humans started the process by displacing the Listeners and disrupting their way of life, and Odium finished the job when the Listeners gave themselves to him to seek Revenge. The Magical Destruction of their Spiritual Identity paralleled the mundane destruction of their Culture.

The Regal Listeners have also lost their Identity through their desire for Revenge, but in a more direct way. Their hunger for power and vengeance has quite literally transformed them, smothering other emotions and personality traits. The Regals have lost themselves to the desire for Revenge, misplacing even the desire to hear the Rhythms that once guided them through life. By taking a Voidspren into their Gemheart, they have allowed their anger and fury to supersede their better nature. But, as we've seen in Eshonai and Venli, they can still set aside Vengeance and seek a better solution.

The Fused are Living Symbols of being unable to give up on old Hate and try to move forward. Every Fused was once a Hero, a Champion of the Listeners that fought for their Home and their Way of Life. However, they are heroes who lost and became the Martyrs of their cause. But these Martyrs don't just drive people to fight on in their memory, they return to life to lead their descendants into battle. They have become monsters. They once fought to give their descendants a better life, and now they consume the lives of their descendants to continue the fight. They have nothing left to live for but Revenge for Ancient Wrongs... and they take the lives of their own people to get it.

---

The Primary Antagonist of the Series is the Anthropomorphic Personification of Odium. Odium works to inspire hatred, and the various forms of hatred are the fundamental driving force of Colonialism and its extended consequences. It is the continued intervention of Odium that has prevented a peace from forming between Listeners and Humanity.

Brandon Sanderson does not create Monolithic Cultures. There are always exceptions. The Listeners probably weren't unified under Odium during the Desolation Era. There were probably Listeners that lived among Humans, like how Shen is a member of Bridge Four/The Windrunners today, and sought peaceful reconciliation before the incident. However, Odium was always there to stir up old pains and keep the fighting going.

The ultimate enemy in the series is, quite literally, the action of inspiring hatred. Lasting victory can only come when the cycle of hate is broken... because that's the moment when odium between Human and Listener ends.",Stormlight_Archive,[Oathbringer] Post-Colonial Symbolism in the Stormlight Archive

62,"**Oathbringer spoilers only up to the point specified in the title.**

Hi! I'm finally getting around to reading Oathbringer and I figured I would share my thoughts here. I did this for Words of Radiance [a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/2crcb5/wor_book_1_and_interludes_1_reactions_spoilers_up/) ([wait a minute,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/2e8evc/wor_part_2_and_interludes_group_2_reactions/) [has it really been](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/2eqedn/wor_part_3_and_interludes_group_3_reactions/) [5 years???](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/2eys74/wor_part_4_end/)) and I rather enjoyed it!

*Before we get started, what's my Cosmere reading status?* I'm actually not super caught up as I probably should be. Besides Stormlight, I've only really read Mistborn through Bands of Mourning. **So no, I have** ***not*** **read Warbreaker or Edgedancer.** My apologies. I think I did read the first volume of White Sand at one point though. Probably not as important right now. 

Anyway, let's get started!

**Eshonai**

*Holy cow* I wasn't expecting something this big as soon as the prologue. Currently, what is apparent is that the *entire current plot* is because Gavilar wanted to Make Alethkar Great Again, and was willing to pay the price for it. My first day was just the prologue and then I had to take a break to just process that. This is something I'll get into more when I talk about Venli, but I really liked Eshonai and it's kind of sad I'll only be seeing her in flashbacks now. 

**Adolin**

He's mentioned as a POV character at the beginning of the part, but he really only has one part of a chapter in Part 1 as an actual POV. However, he's still a *big heckin' deal.* His murder of Sadeas at the end of Words of Radiance is a driving factor of Part 1's plot, and it's great to see him chafe in his armor when he gets assigned to *solve the murder.* Shenanigans will definitely ensue! I feel like he's going to be swearing some oaths at some point, but I'm clueless as to what kind of oaths he'll take. But he's going to have to face the music that the guy nobody liked was actually liked by a few people.

So when is Renarin gonna do something more than tell people how unsure of himself he is?

**Shallan**

Hands down the MVP of this part. Her struggle with her self-hatred really resonated with me, and it's really cool to see how her Lightweaver powers both help as a coping mechanism and hinder as a crutch. Escaping into Veil or Brightness Radiant might help right now, but sooner or later she'll need to accept herself as Shallan if she really wants to progress (and I think that's why Pattern is concerned about her next oaths). My favorite scene in this part is when she lightweaves the play from her childhood. Also, the fact that she could reach out and *understand* the Unmade in the basement... Powerful.

Also it's your boi Jasnah here to steal the show at the last minute!!

**Dalinar**

So Dalinar's big thing is that he has been chosen to unite the world against the Everstorm, and he's not very well-equipped to do that because *politics.* Dang politics, always getting in the way! At least he's got Navani to help, and Taravingian as well! I did think of one solution. That one Queen wants to reclaim Adolin's Shards back, right? Well, I mean, maybe if Adolin suddenly didn't need those Shards anymore, then they could give them back with no issue! I wonder how that could happen...

Dalinar is also our flashback character! Goodness does Past Dalinar commit a lot of murders. I'm glad to see that he's kind of beginning to mellow out by the end of the flashbacks in this part, but there's a long road from then to now and we haven't even been told how he came to receive his Old Magic boon/curse.

Speaking of, we know Dalinar's wife's name now! I have this sinking feeling that even though Dalinar thought that he was cursed to forget *Evi*, what it really means is that he was cursed to forget *his wife*, and now that he has a new one...

**Kaladin**

Compared to all the crazy going on at Uruthiru, Kaladin's plotline was rather simple. He makes it back to his hometown, finds that everyone is okay, then runs in with some awakened Parshendi! But *oh NO, they're people!!* Now he has to deal with *ethics!* Man, whenever it's explained why the Old Knights broke their oaths, I hope it's not too much of an *""are we the baddies?""* kind of twist.

**Puuli &amp; Ellista**

The first two Interludes were nice, fun stories. I especially enjoyed Ellista's character quirk of ""reads romance novels in her free and not-so-free time"". It's nice to see some other perspectives around the world.

**Venli**

So now Venli doesn't have Eshonai to keep her grounded. Remind me, since it's been a while, was Eshonai killed in the last book, or was this off screen? I think it's the former but I could be wrong. Well, I hope the Parshendi can come out of this mess better than they started.",Stormlight_Archive,"[Oathbringer] First Read: Prologue, Part 1, and First Interlude Group"

67,"Hello everyone!  So like many of you I have been re-reading the series to get ready for Book 4, and I'm currently in WoR.  I don't know how I thought it all made sense to me the first time I read through, but I've been struggling a bit with Shallan in the first 450 pages.


It just seems to me that it is way too easy for her to 1) convince Tvlakv to take her to the SP; 2) convince Vathah and co. to not rape/kill her and FURTHERMORE convince them to attack bandits; and most egregious so far, 3) to convince Sebarial to take her in with a simple innocent shrug and a hope - right in the middle of an intense planning sesh with all the Alethi highprinces to boot.  


I know she's able to Lightweave and make herself appear more imperious, more regal, more dignified etc., but it just feels like Brandon took the easy way out in all these scenarios.  I get that there is a lot to accomplish in one book, a lot of plot to cover, but all of those accomplishments just felt too easy to me.  I also get the Brandon is not a ""dark, gritty"" fantasy author (and I prefer that BTW!) and likes to bring out the good parts of human nature.  Again, it just felt like it should have been a lot more difficult if not impossible for Shallan to win over those groups of people and bring them under her authority.  At the very least it should have taken maybe the rest of the book for her to end triumphant over those struggles, with many defeats along the way resulting in growth.

I am on chapter 15 of OB and Dalinar is talking with the Stormfather who I understand to be a cognitive shadow of the Almighty. I don’t really get what that means but I guess I think of it as a part/piece. I believe in the book he says he is to the almighty as Dalinar’s shadow is to him. 

In addition, I understand Odium to also be a piece of the Almighty. Maybe like a rotten piece? I don’t know... am I to be RAFOed on Odium’s nature? Or is there something I can know about him at this point? Is he a piece of the almighty like the Stormfather?

74,"I'm new to Sanderson's works (save for Whitesand). I have a long commute to work and have wanted to dive into the Stormlight Archive for some time, so I'm listening to the audio book. Caladin's chapters are read by a male voice and Shallon's chapters are read by a female voice.

One of the things I'm confused about is regarding these two characters. Because we more or less start with Caladin, I've been treating him as the MC with Shallon as a side character. I'm slowly coming to the realization that that's probably not the best approach. Does Shallon eventually do something that feels connected to Caladin or a larger story? The Prologue and Caladin's early chapters feel somewhat connected to me. Shallon feels completely disconnected these other parts. Am I just being impatient here?

The other thing I'm confused about is whether or not Stormlight Archive was the right place to start swimming in this world. Seems like many folks started in Mistborn or somewhere else.

2) We know from Hero of Ages that even a small imbalance in available power between Shards will eventually make a difference. Even though Honor was splintered, his investiture is still the main source of power for the Knights Radiant, and we also know that it cannot be used by the Fused. If the KR return in force then how can Odium deal with them without opening himself up to a strike from Cultivation?

97,"After reading Mistborn: The Final Empire and [not really liking it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/es3sks/final_empire_thoughts/), I decided to drop that series and stick with Sanderson by reading WoK.  After finishing, I have some thoughts on the book below:

**The Good:**

* Spren/Syl - Because so many of the characters and much of the plot points of this book are very serious in nature, I think it was a real storytelling risk on the part of Sanderson to juxtapose that with Fairytale elements, which is essentially what Syl and the Spren are.  I thought these pieces added much to the book and change my impression of Roshar completely. The Spren add a metaphysical element to the characters' everyday lives that would otherwise leave Roshar a much bleaker place.

* Roshar Itself - The world of Mistborn shows a place where the bad guy has essentially already won.  Sanderson takes that a step further here by building a world in Roshar that's so completely broken that the land itself doesn't function normally anymore.  The mentions of Shinovar as being such a weird place are especially clever, as they reflect just how alien our concept of normalcy is to Alethi society.  Roshar is really a character unto itself, as the mystery of how Roshar came to be that way is integral to the story.

* The Characters - I didn't think that most of the characters in Mistborn had much depth.  Four years of additional writing experience and adopting the ASOIF approach of having numerous perspective characters clearly benefits Sanderson here.  He does a much better job this time of informing the reader of why the various characters think the way they do.

**The Bad:**

* The Pacing - I felt as though there was a 200-250 page lull in the middle of the book where essentially nothing happened.  I can understand a section of the book where the plot moves slowly in order to develop characters, but we don't even get much of that during Part 3 of the text.  It seemed as though we alternated through 10 straight chapters of Kaladin hanging with his bridge crew, being depressed, and flashing back to small town politics, while Shallan sits in a room and theorizes on Rosharan history with Jasnah.  Both the plot and the characters at this point seem to come to a standstill.  I realize that Sanderson needs to world-build, but I wish he chose to do so through having an additional character (not sure where this series is going, so I'm not sure who that character could be).  Do all of Sanderson's books follow this pattern of having a slow burn for much of the book and everything happening at the end?

**Favorite Scene:**  When Kaladin meets Hoid by the fire.

**Favorite Character:** I actually had Terevangian for this until the very end.  I'd have to say my favorite now is Dalinar.

I enjoyed this book very much.  I really only had that one negative that stuck out to me.  I will probably begin Words of Radiance in a couple of weeks or so.  Is there any required Cosmere reading before starting the next book?",Stormlight_Archive,Way of Kings - Concluding Thoughts

100,"""If Dalinar can be redeemed than so can Moash.""

""But Dalinar didn't kill a king.""

""He killed a high prince or ten.""

""Ah, yes. But he also killed everyone who would have been upset about those deaths. So, No hatered, just fear. Brutal, efficient. So technically Dalinar is Not redeemed. He has just been accepted by those around him as good. In fact! I believe he turned down a redemption from Odium himself, what was that line?

""You cannot have my pain!""

Redemption is all about perspective. Moash/Vyre is currently redeemed in the eyes of the  Singers. But not our main cast of characters. I'm sure Kaladin will try. But I'm also pretty sure that Moash will be Kaladin's biggest failing in Kaladin's own eyes. The friend he couldn't save.

There are some other outcomes I think are possible. Sanderson likes to mess with his own tropes.

But until then. Or until Dalinar himself Forgives Moash.

Fuck. Moash. Eleven. Times. Over.

102,"I am relistening to the SA for the umpteenth time and I just passed the part where Rock tells the story about how his people were hunted, prompting them to approach the gods of the seas, the forests and finally the mountains.

I have long felt that the Horneaters had some parshendi blood in them, and this is starting to connect in my head to them being hunted. If the Horneaters were the result of interbreeding between parshendi and humans, then it would make sense that there would be animosity between the groups. Right after desolations, there would be anger towards opposing sides - humans would distrust anything connected to parsh, and probably fear that the part-parsh nature of the Horneaters would result in hosts for the returned.

Anyone else have similar thoughts or know of some lore to support or refute this idea?

As for fabrials, I am starting to feel that they are the literary analogue to hemalurgy from Mistborn. It is very common for writers to create analogous structures in their different books, and I feel like that might be the case here. Hemalurgy is dangerous and can be misused, it steals powers from people to be used by those without those powers, and there is debate among the surviving members of the crew as to whether the knowledge should remain lost. On Roshar, fabrials steal power from spren, sort of, and we have seen that there are great efforts being made to hide the source of things like soul casters.

Brandon has said that Allomancy is net positive, Feruchemy is net neutral, and Hemalurgy is net negative in terms of source of power. Are these same concepts going to be at play on Roshar? As we learn more about Voidbringing, Radiance and Fabrials, I feel like we might.

Then I get into the Axies interlude and I finally found his place, I think. At least one of the many roles that he is very well suited for. 

He has the deepest knowledge of spren and could be very influential in the discovery of the healing process of the shard blades. Thinking about his race and where it places him in relation to the war, I wonder if he is seeking out the knights radiant at all.  If not, I wonder if they accidentally free him in some battle and win him over somehow. Maybe a Lopen and his spren buddy cop thing. 

He could also help them with the ancient art of fabrials as many have suggested. But that's easy. Maybe he leads them to the thousands of missing shard blades  That's a stretch. The ayamiens are very long lived and as such can answer many questions. The early entrance of Axies just makes me feel like he is the one who will be one of the conveyors of the knowledge and possible treasures that's left from the scouring. He may even be vital in the creation of hundreds of new knights through the revival of new high spren that are newly awoken and have whatever purpose that they agreed upon with their previous knights.

So I tried to replicate as much as Roshar as I could. It is a large map size but I still had difficulty getting a lot of the proportions right, but it does make sense. The main thing that deviates from cannon Roshar is that I randomly generated resources. I then went back over and change resources to make them relevant to the city locations they were near. Like in \[Shinover\]([https://imgur.com/EGTGfDN](https://imgur.com/EGTGfDN)), I removed all stone and mines and added a heap of horses, sheep and crops not found in Roshar. I did had to keep horses throughout other parts of the map to make it playable for Civ’s dependent on them but limited them a bit. Unfortunately the mountains don't appear in the overview map but my screenshots kinda show you how many there are.

The main features are:

Ice surrounding the map to make circumnavigation impossible. Seeing as highstorms limit ocean travel I think this makes sense.

Unclaimed hills dessert hills with no resources but goody huts to make it semi worthwhile exploring.

I made the \[shattered plains\]([https://imgur.com/73ToDJl](https://imgur.com/73ToDJl)) separated by rivers, I tried to make them as symmetrical as possible. I also put a heap of gemstones near them. I purposefully did not make a flat desert tile as a petra here would be too OP.

\[All kingdoms are separate continents.\]([https://imgur.com/0c0Ls11](https://imgur.com/0c0Ls11))

Urithiru was placed as \[Mount Everest\]([https://imgur.com/sL8PzXL](https://imgur.com/sL8PzXL)). Probably not in the right location but because I don’t know exactly where it is, I chose a decent spot for the yields.

\[Horneater peaks\]([https://imgur.com/BnAvSkZ](https://imgur.com/BnAvSkZ)) was probably the most change location from the series. I moved the hot springs and lakes down from the mountains so the yields could be farmed.

170,"With book 4 coming out at the end of this year I have been thinking about how Willshapers will ""fit in"" or what their role might be. We already know how some of the other orders will basically be used.  Lightweavers make great spy's, Windrunners are excellent scouts, Bondsmiths are natural leaders, Stonewards are the front line troops, Edgedancers would be battlefield healers,  Skybreakers are the military police (maybe not the best comparison but I couldn't think of something better).  With the Willshapers we know very little about them and how they utilize their surges but let's take a look at what we do know because I have a crazy theory (but hopefully not too crazy) on what they are going to be.

""Kalak will teach you to cast bronze"" WoR I-7.

Literally the only thing we know about the herald of Willshapers is he taught metalworks.

""And now, if there was an uncut gem among the radiance, it was the Willshapers; for though enterprising, they were erratic, and Invia wrote of them, ""capricious, frustrating, unreliable,"" as taking it for granted that others would agree; this may have been an intolerant view, as Invia often expressed, for this order was said to be most varied, inconsistent in temperament save for a general love of adventure, novelty, or oddity.""   WoR ch 7 epigraph

Sheesh Invia.  Who peed in your cheerios.  What gives her the right to write about the radiants in such a way!  Alright, no more joking around.  Back to the topic at hand.

Their surges are Transportation and Cohesion but we have  no confirmations or examples on how they used them.  And lastly we know that Eshonai and Venli both have traits that attracted the willshaper spren timbre.  That's pretty much it.  Don't think I've missed anything so let's put on our tinfoil guys, gals, and kandras and get a little crazy.



My theory is that the Willshapers were the  emissaries or envoys for the radiants. Now hear me out, I don't think it's too much a stretch.  Let's take a look at the surges first.

We've seen transportation used by the elsecallers to jump between the physical and cognitive only.  But we've seen something else that uses transportation.  The oathgates.  They were built to transport the same way as the elsecallers (but that feature was disabled by honor?) And they also transport through the physical realm which could be a parallel on how the willshapers use the same surge.  Goes along well with being game for adventure if you ask me. Also very useful if you are visiting other countries or peoples as an envoy.

Next up Cohesion.  Sadly we have no good examples in world of the ability. So let's look at the definition  instead.  

1. The action or fact of forming a united whole.

2. The sticking together of particles of the same substance. (Physics)

Forming a united whole I feel is a good purpose to send out an envoy or emissary for to other countries or groups.  And it could give them some kind of resonance or knack to do so kinda like how dalinar as a bondsmith can touch others and speak to others in their native tongue.

Then lastly looking at eshonai's POV in oathbringer we see her acting like an emissary or envoy for her people when they are meeting with elhokar the night he died.  And we also see Venli be chosen by Odium as an envoy for the parshendi.  Both sisters at one time or another acting in the same capacity.  

I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb with this theory but I'd also like to know what you all think as well.   Am I missing anything that would refute the idea? Do I have too much tinfoil in my hat?  Please share with me your thoughts and ideas!",Stormlight_Archive,About Willshapers and their role.

175,"Hello, everyone, I'm new to this subreddit and Brandon Sanderson in general.
So, I've been thinking about Shalash's birthplace. I think Brandon RAFOd questions about her but I feel like there are things we can infer from the facts we know from canon.
So Shalash and Jezrien seem to have an age gap of less than 10 years. Shalash is never described as looking like a child so I'm assuming that she in her 20s while Jezrien is described as a man barely turning 30 (looks wise only, I know that they are 4500years+ old). If Jezrien had Shalash as a mortal human, that means he would have had to be ten years old or less due to their small age gap. My theory is that he had her after he became a Herald and we know from WOB that the Heralds became Heralds after moving to Roshar.

 So he must have had her in Roshar after he became a Herald or he was already immortal in Ashyn. What do you guys think? I'm sorry if this has been discussed before but I haven't seen this theory anywhere.",Stormlight_Archive,Shalash's Birthplace

Needless to say I have a couple questions. Specifically related to Oathbringer because I feel like a lot happened in that book and some stuff happened to quickly. 
 
 
1. So what was with Teft saying the 3rd Ideal? Shouldn’t Kaladin have said that? I was confused by that. I was thinking he was going to become his own order of Knights Radiant but maybe I missed something.
 
2. Is Roshar a sphere or is it flat? If if hasn’t been confirmed yet then I assume it might play out later in the story but I wasn’t sure.
 
3. So at the end when Shallan is having a conversation with Veil and Radiant is she the only one seeing them? Other characters were communicating with her but I wasn’t sure if they were seeing them or just her?
 
4. How vital is it that I read edgedancer? I should say that I like Lift but I don’t LOVE her so I’m super excited to read a story dedicated mainly to her. 
 
I probably have more questions but these are all that I could think of right now. I’m super excited for Rhythm of War in November!",Stormlight_Archive,Post Oathbringer Questions
184,"So I just finished Words of Radiance for the first time, here are the bits that I really enjoyed:

1. The interludes with Eshonai are really cool and I love the concept of a people fleeing from their gods, it gives an interesting feel to their culture and makes whatever force they refer to as gods seem incredibly intimidating,

2. The bit where Kaladin is flying around the chasms is absolutely beautiful, as it the part where he is defending Elhokar and gets Syl back: the idea of the frost glyph thing was awesome. Also, ""Honor is dead, but I'll see what I can do"".

3. Taravangian's interlude was great and the idea of the Diagram gives off some serious H.P. Lovecraft vibes, making it a chilling companion to the reveal at the end of TWoK.

4. That bit at the end with Adolin and Sadeas, and also the part where Shallan kills her father while singing the lullaby, were both brutal and really made me view their characters in a different light.

186,"I was doing a bit of rereading and researsh, and I came to a couple of intresting ideas...

&gt;!So for one, it is said that the unmade Ba-Ado-Mishram was involved in the false desolation by granting the parshman the ability to use voidlight, and that Melishi (the last Bondsmith) fought and possibly traped the unmade.!&lt;

&gt;!I think in order to win the battle, Melishi had to breake the bond between Ba-Ado-Mishram and the parshendi, as Ba-Ado-Mishram work to break the conviction the Radiants had in their oaths.!&lt;

&gt;!I also think that Melishi, beeing a bondsmith, was bound by the nahel bond to the Sibling, that is said to be slumbering. Well it is said that the spren don't really die, but lose cognition, or in other words ""slumber"". !&lt;

&gt;!I belive that in order to deafeat Ba-Ado-Mishram, Melishi had to break his own oath to the Sibling, so he could understand the Unmade enought to trap him in a perfect gemstone. Doing so destroyed the Sibling's mind puting him in a slumber and trasforming him in what is now called the Cusicesh The Protector of Iri, a mindless giagantic spren ominusly enought is said to be slumbering.!&lt;

&gt;!And that ultimately broke the Radiants and their bonds by witnessing how even the bondsmith Melishi broke his oaths, and also by the fact that once the Sibling (Cusicesh) died, the tower of Urithiru stoped working properly and had to be abandoned.!&lt;",Stormlight_Archive,Theory on the False Desolation

So I just read Rlain’s chapter and I am thinking I missed something about Voidbringers and Parshendi. I thought that Eshnonai kinda had everyone change into Stormform. But then the chapters with Moash seem to indicate there are still dullform parshendi. So does this mean only the parshendi turned to stormform and the parshman (living as slaves before) are still in dullform and didn’t make that switch?

Also, Rlain says ‘all [of his people] had been either murdered or corrupted.’ Is this a general statement that all of his species were either dead (from battle of Narak) or under the control/authority of these Fused beings ?

Lastly, i feel I don’t understand how the term voidbringer is being used. I assume The Fused are voidbringers, are parshendi in stormform Voidbringers? Are warform parshendi or parshendi of forms that are not considered forms of power/gods also Voidbringers now?

Alright, so the books. Damn. Every book I'm just getting so damn excited each time. It's all hard to process and I'm bad at turning my thoughts in to words.

Alright so here is where I may get hate: I think Sanderson can be somewhat on the nose and direct with his dialogue. Please don't hurt me.

Hoods story about Queen Tsa to Shallan mentions how the queen got a godly power to give her a child, maybe she somehow got Tanavast to enter an agreement with her and as we know shards are bound to the agreements they make. This could possibly have contributed to Tanavast weakening as he was forced to do something un-honourable by cheating on Cultivation, allowing Odium to get the upper hand. 

TLDR: stormfather calls Kal something different to everyone else, this :. 100% means that Kal is descended from Tanavast no ifs or buts /s",Stormlight_Archive,"Theory about Kaladin, bit of a wild one"
242,"So I just finished re reading The Way of Kings yesterday, and something occurred to me. Everyone knows how frequent symmetry in words and names are. Which got me thinking about the tiles of the books.


First, we had The Way of Kings (TWoK). Next we had Words of Radiance (WoR). Then Oathbringer (O). And now we are getting Rhythm of War (RoW). Putting the abbreviations together, there is perfect symmetry so far, TWoKWoRORoW. Going by this, I feel the 5th book will be along the lines of KoWT. I've spent the past 24 hours trying to think of possible names for the 5th book. I havent come up with anything yet, but curious if anyone else has noticed this, and if you guys have any ideas.",Stormlight_Archive,Book 5 title (possible spoilers)
247,"I was thinking here and in Oathbringer we found out that voidbringers are parshendi ""possessed"" by voidspren (which are kind of like the parshendi soul corrupted by Odium); and in Oathbringer, Odium manages to corrupt / possess humans, do you think that the souls of these humans were infused with the Investiture of Odium and that these souls can become a new type of voidspren, and by consequence when possessing humans became a new type of voidbringer?",Stormlight_Archive,"Theory, voidspren, spoiler for Oathbringer"
250,"So I’ve been reading through the way of kings and am a fair way through. And I had a question. I don’t mind spoilers so you can give details if you want. Just a few questions about bridgemen.

1. Why is it that Sadeas never tried to train the bridge men? If kaladin thought of doing it, certainly Sadeas could. After all, I can understand not making them armored. It makes them light and fast and draws alethi Fire. But why don’t they train them? Why not get bridgemen to train and simply get better at doing their jobs? Kaladin thought of it. So even if Sadeas is cruel and wasteful why not go for it

2. Why is it that the bridgemen were discouraged from training by being given busy work? I remember something along the lines of it being done to keep them busy and to make sure the soldiers didn’t have to deal with them 

3. Why is it that it was only kaladin who thought of training the bridgemen? Surely some other army official must have seen the appeal of the idea?",Stormlight_Archive,A few questions about the bridgemen.

So I was thinking, do you think that because there are 10 different types of gems, maybe each one goes with an order of Knight Radiants to give them more power. Or maybe each Order can storage their power in their gem so another person can use that power. I was rereading TWoK, and in the first vision form Dalinar, there's a Radiant Knight that says something like ""I have to save my restoration for the other people"" ( Or something like that I'm reading the book in Spanish ).

261,"So I’ve been looking at a lot of debates about a lack of consequences in the books. Specifically for shallan. Now it’s not that I don’t like shallan. But my things is this, Mary Sue. Some people think she’s a Mary Sue. Now granted it should be noted that Mary Sue is subjective. However while shallan doesn’t fit certain definitions of a Mary Sue, given that she does fail and does have flaws, and she creditably isn’t good at everything, but seems to lack long lasting consequences. She gets multiple people hurt throughout the books through her own stupidity, however there are certain things that she is simply forgiven for. Now her messing with the ghost bloods will hopefully have some consequences. But let’s just go through this. 

She fails to get jasnah to make her a ward. But then she just gets the position anyway. Now granted she does do this under the logic “if I can’t get rid of you I’ll make use of you” which does make sense. However it’s the start of certain things. It escalates when she steals the soul caster but then she just gets forgiven.

Now I don’t have a problem with these moments. Because if all of them have a reason then that’s fine. If it’s justifiable that’s fine. However if she never gets any long lasting consequences that’s something else.

So could someone give me a simple list of places where she fucked up that affected her and causes her development, but also where it affected others? Where it caused long term consequences to anyone besides herself? Just a simple rundown is all I’d like.",Stormlight_Archive,Lack of consequences for certain characters

So im on my second reread of the series and midway through WoK i realized that all of the book titles in the series are actual in world books

Way of Kings written by Nohadon, Words of Radiance the knights radiant book and Oathbringer the book Dalinar’s writing

So im wondering if Rhythm of War will be an in world book too maybe written by the Parshendi

269,"Ok, so i was driving home from work and this idea hit me, tell me what you think.

So at first glance, the Adhesion Surge doesn't seem to have any damaging capabilities, both Szeth and Kaladin generally use Gravitation to do the hurting. I mean its just magic gluing.

But, if you look in the back of the books, Adhesion is listed as the surge of Pressure and Vacuum. So the thought hit me, what if Adhesion is just a magically powerful suction cup effect?

Also, we know that a powerful enough Windrunner can use Adhesion to manipulate air, like how Kaladin manipulates the Highstorm winds in Oathbringer.

So here is my question for you all, could a powerful enough Windrunner use an Adhesion Surge to create a vacuum around someones head and stop them from breathing?",Stormlight_Archive,Adhesion Surge offensive capabilities??

Also, i thought the shardblades where the blades from the heralds, but then I realised there were more than 9.

276,"I’m going to be honest for a minute. I was wrong. I went into WOK thinking it was going to be a silly over bloated Fantasy book. Then when actually started reading it I felt vindicated. I could not make sense of what was who and where was how and it just felt like Sanderson was writing in circles. The first third of WOK was real hard to get through for me personally. I almost put it down. 
Fortunately things started getting better until.... sweet baby Jesus I could not put it down.
Now I have a rule that I never read books in a series back to back. I like to let them breath a bit if you get my drift. So I read the shortest book I could find before jumping into WOR.

Venli may be scared of betraying the fused and living up to her sisters ideals and I feel that may be a big part of her second oath.  Perhaps along the lines of ""I will not fear the unknown""  or ""I will not be content with pain""  obviously sando will make the exact language more elegant.

288,"I can’t put my finger was it
A on why but I continue to find Shallan’s parts increasingly hard to get through. I love these books i want to say right off. Shallan’s chapters have some of the funniest  some of the most insightful some of the creepiest parts in the series not to mention most of the world building and magic system explanations.  

HOWEVER she might just be one of my least favorite characters in any series I’ve come across and I can’t say exactly why. I am almost done with oathbringer. I’ve seen what she can do so far and the person she was/is/becoming. 

The closest I have been able to come on why I feel this way during long contemplations on her. Is I feel there is two a ages to ever person. Their Phiscal age and there mental/emotional age. Phiscal age how long you have been alive and the other the experiences you’ve had in that time alive. This can translate to a 45 year old man child who grew up with the emotional maturity of a teen and a teen who has seen some shit and has the emotional maturity of a 45 year old man. 

With all the stuff that has happened to her Shallan has the emotional and mental maturity of a preteen. I get she was sheltered for a long time and she repressed the worst of her childhood memories and is just dealing with them but come on women grow up. She’s been gone from home for over a year by the this point in oathbringer and the second she figured out some of her powers she uses most of her skill to creat  false identities. These identities are useful for sure but seeing what repression and compartmentalizations did to her in the past. I feel she should realize how her person would handle this self imposed schizophrenia especially when she refuses to confide with anyone or let anyone keep these other people in check.

I think in short I just want her to grow up I’m tired to reading a child I was tired of it in the first book she got a little better isn’t he second with the slavers and her winning her own little army. Then from there it felt like all progress lost and she went back to her self. 

I would love anybody else’s thoughts. This still doesn’t put into words all my feelings about her but I can’t really figure them out my self. All I know is I’m tired of groaning when I hear it’s her part coming up.",Stormlight_Archive,Dose anybody els have a problem with Shallan?
289,"So as anyone who has read these books knows, shallan is far from perfect, especially in TWoK where she is looking to steal jasnah’s soul caster. But of course she is also, you know, insane.

But one thing I find interesting, is her popularity with other people. Early in the way of kings before we meet jasnah shallan seems like the perfect candidate for her ward. She’s somewhat witty, intellectually curious, and a great artist. And then you see that pretty much everyone she meets in the beginning likes her. The sailors like her, yalb and the captain basically think she’s perfect and beautiful to boot. And she seems like a smart, if somewhat insecure, teenager. 

And then she meets jasnah. I honestly feel bad for shallan to a degree. She thinks she’s this perfect, witty and clever artist who is a great scholar. Then she actually meets jasnah, and reality comes crashing down. We’re made aware that aside from her art skills she may very well be BELOW the average in terms of knowledge and education, which is surprising given her introduction. And then later on not only do we slowly see her unravel into what she actually is, an insecure insane teenager who’s only saving graces are art and a witty tongue. Hell, jasnah points put herself that while shallan can be witty, half her quips are pretty sub-par. Which is pretty painful considering that while she is touted as brilliant by many, the only actual qualities she has that she gets complimented for are her art and her witty tongue.

So why is it that despite only having a decently witty tongue, which isn’t so clever a lot of times, and good art and not much other notable qualities aside from batshit insanity, that she is so loved by many in the beginning and later?",Stormlight_Archive,Why is shallan so loved by everyone around her in the beginning.

**We're here for a quick check up on the state of** r/Stormlight_Archive!

*Rhythm of War,* the fourth entry to the Stormlight Archive, is releasing on November 17th of this year. It feels like a long way off... but it will be here before we know it!

If you were around prior to *Oathbringer*, then you probably realize this subreddit is going to be exploding with activity at the end of the year. Between old subscribers coming out of hibernation, new readers flocking in droves, and everybody HYPED, things are gonna be **crazy**. We're on target to hit 100 thousand subscribers sometime this summer, meaning we'll have well *over 4 times* as many people around at the *Rhythm of War* release as we did when *Oathbringer* came along.

The moderation team wants to make sure we've got all of our chulls in a row before that happens!

To aid our efforts, we've put together a survey and we'd **really** appreciate if you could take just a few moments to fill that out. We highly value your opinions and can promise that they will directly factor in to how the subreddit is moderated. It's an opportunity for you to let us know how well the rules and moderation is working out. There's a lot of opinions out there that we have to balance, but even though we can't please everyone in every way we are always striving to make sure this place is as close to possible to what our subscribers want it to be.

*The survey is completely anonymous and all questions are optional*, so you can say whatever you want and you can say as little or as much as you want. We have no way to connect your answers to you or your Reddit username. However, please realize that we will eventually make the results of the survey public! So be aware that anything you say in the free response questions will be out there for anyone to read. :)

The survey includes some free response opportunities for you to say anything you want... But you're also welcome to make use of the comments here, especially if you want to get a discussion going on some point!

Thanks again for your time! We will probably leave this up for several weeks, until the number of new responses slows to a trickle. We'll spend some time chewing on the results internally and then make them (along with our analysis and thoughts) public in a few months.

335,"My colleague and I are currently debating If a man where to be soulcast into bread and then consumed by his brethren, would it be considered cannibalistic?

According to the Oxford Dictionary, Cannibalism is defined as: *the practice of eating the flesh of one's own species.*

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Cannibalism is defined as: *the eating of the flesh of an animal by another animal of the same kind* 

Accorning to Stormlight Archive WIKI from fandom.com, Soulcasting is defined as: the art of changing one substance to another.

We know from multiple points in the book series, most notably Shallon's attempt at Soulcasting with everyone's favorite *Stick*, That everything on Roshar has a soul. 

When a *living* person, is soulcast into something else, such as a statue does that statue retain the soul of what it once was? 

Or does something happen to the former soul, and the statue is now inhabited by a soul made up of what it currently is?
*I recall something in the book about the souls of objects being what they are percieved as or something to that effect* 

If the latter is true and the new soulcast material is no longer inhabited by the soul of a person than than I'd say no, you are not eating your brethren by consuming a soulcast person of your species.

*However* If the former is true, and the new soul cast material is still inhabited by the soul of the person than yes you are eating your brethren. 

**but** this is still contingent on the fact that according to two dictionary sources 
Cannibalism is defined as eating the *flesh*
of your own species. And if the flesh of your own species is soulcast into something *Not* of your species than is it still cannibalism?

So my theory is you are NOT practicing cannibalism by eating a soulcast person of your own species.
But if the new soulcast material still contains the soul of the person before they where soulcast than you are still eating your  you brethren.

I'd like the thoughts and input if this wonderful community on this, what do ya think?",Stormlight_Archive,"Soulcasting, can it be Cannibalistic?"

Shallan hints that something was “done” to Jasnah before in order to make her go out bait the thieves into the death trap.

I personally think she was sexually assaulted as a child. It would give a lot more dimension to her character and would provide a lot of reason for her struggles with processing emotions (despite her ridiculous intellect).

353,"I'm marking this through Oathbringer due to knowledge of the Cognitive realm developing more and more.

Do we know if the Superposition of quantum particles is what inspired Brandon to write the idea that measuring a Spren and then recording that measurement locks it into that size? Or is this solely because the cognitive realm exists as it is viewed/imagined/thought of by people?

If you are unfamiliar with Superposition, it is almost exactly the same concept. You may have heard of Schrödinger's cat. This is Superposition. A subject exists in both States of possibility until it is observed and measured, essentially. This is why light acts as both a wave and a particle, just not at the same time (but, you know, still at the same time). We can measure one or the other, and doing so provides results for that outcome. Another example of this would be the double slit experiment, in which electrons pass through two parallel slits. It would be assumed that the pattern on the other side would be two straight filtered lines of the electrons that made it through, however instead we see an interference pattern, showing that an individual electron passes through BOTH slits at the same time.

Ok, sorry😄, I know that was long winded and maybe a bit rough around the edges.

33- Can we trust Kabsal then? Can we trust Jasnah? Can we even trust Shallan? Geez. 

34- I half expected the men to fight for him and intercede Kaladin’s beating... But no, now the highstorm. 

35- Did Kaladin become infused with Stormlight by surviving?!

36- That was tense. What is Shallan going to do with a Soulcaster? And what is Jasnah going to do without one?

386,"So I heard about Brandon Sanderson maybe a year back, but I am Croatian, and somehow I hoped that his books will be translated in croatian. I understand english really good but its not the same to read it in your own language. Between last Christmass and New Year I bought Amazon kindle on discount because I found out that there is dictionary integrated, and I decided to give a try to Stormlight Archive.

67 days after New Year, I read it all. Way of Kings, then Warbreaker, then Words of Radiance, then Edgedancer, and finally Oathbringer. I know that I wasnt fast reader in this case, but with a job and a little kid I am really happy I managed to read it in this period.

I am really stunned at the impact these books had on me. I found them the most complete fantasy experience I ever had. I was afraid before I began of some comments I red online that the characters are good or evil, that its pretty clear who is good and who is bad guy, but that is not the case here. Main characters are people with troublesome past, deeply wounded, and they are trying to do the best they can. Worldbuilding is amazing, I enjoy travel through Roshar. Also pacing is great, Brandon is real master of that, of the way we get information about this world and inhabitants.

 I was angry, dissapointed, happy, sad, betrayed, bitter, surprised and more. True emotional rollercoaster. Would definitely recommend.

 Absolutely 10/10 experience.

399,"Let me just start by saying that while this a Sanderson appreciation post it's something that has been on my mind and something that i feel like sharing. 

Over the course of the last few years i have dealt with some mental health issues. First and foremost I am gay (its not an 'issue' anymore, I am out and proud, but it's at the root of some of my problems). Being raised in a Catholic 'nun' school and living in an environment where boys don't cry lead to me repressing my feelings and emotions, and I eventually became depressed. 

My only safe space and the only situations that I allowed myself to feel something was when i was reading, where i could live vicariously through the characters adventures. Through my love of fantasy/high-fantasy I found the Wheel of Time series (one of my favorites of all time) and Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere works. And I quickly became obsessed. 

When i started The Stormlight Archive things became different. The way Brandon writes about mental issues made me connect with the characters at a deeper level. I could see where Kaladin's distrust of lighteyes came from. How the 'logical' choice for Shallan was manufacturing new identities and repressing her true self. How Dalinar could lose himself in his vices in order to not face the day to day. I could see myself in them and I laughed and cried and hated with the characters more than I had before.

And then the Battle of Thaylen Field happend. And everything changed. Everything changed with a 'small' little passage:

&gt;!I will protect those I hate. Even...even if the one I hate most is... myself.!&lt; 

For the first time in what feels like forever I cried. I broke down and cried. But i didn't cry with the characters or for them. I cried for a boy trapped in the closet. I cried for the boy who reinvented himself so that he wouldn't get bullied. I cried for a boy that lost his friends.  I cried for a teen on the edge of a chasm. I cried for myself. Years of repressed emotions and feelings came gushing out. And i cried. And cried. And cried until I was spent and worn out. In the end I was at peace and I found the strength to shed my Veil and start living and feeling for myself.

So thank you Brandon Sanderson for teaching me a valuable lesson:

Wow. Spren can give such power. If they could harness the power of the storms they'd be almost unstoppable. And it seems Eshonai is the only one with a nuanced view. The other parshendi seem to just hate humans 

Wow, this Billa really doesn't like humans! I'm a bit wary of her. Willing to do anything for vengeance against humans. 

Could the gods be voidbringers? They sure are scared of them. Fascinating to find a culture scared of their gods.

I find this whole way of songs and rhythms really interesting. I dont quite understand it, but it brings a new dimension to the conflict from within the parshendi.

I didnt know spren are trapped in gemstones! Well maybe I did but forgot. Either way that's interesting. It seems theres a heavy focus on the spren in this book and everything in the world seems to connect back to them.

It seems that to bond with the spren gives them their armour. Perhaps when someone human has the full words said they transform in some sense too. Interesting that they learnt how to capture spren from the humans. When and where did they learn that? Humans from what I remember dont do that nowadays? Maybe I'm forgetting something ha

Interesting that there was the suggestion earlier that venli could become a parshman by accident by trying to get stormform. Perhaps all the parshmen did it by accident? I wonder what spren you have to bond with to get dullform?!

So there are definitely parshmen spies who deliberately took dullform! I wonder if shen is one. I hope not.

Ooh so theres a kind of ritual they go through when they grow old enough. A first transformation. Thats a cool part of their culture.

Aww man. Dementia. That's rough. Sanderson is one of the few authors I'd trust to handle it well and he seems to be off to a good start here. Must sting for Eshonai that her mother sees her as a bit of a maverick and venli is seen as the good daughter.

The Unmade are clearly their gods. I wanna know what made them so scared of them!! I mean if they call their place of origin the dark home,you know its gotta be pretty bad ha

Ah there the chapter title! I wonder if the parshendi as a whole were the last legion or the ones that fled were a legion that survived and carried on the parshendi line. Perhaps they were voidbringers, but had been manipulated by their Gods by being given power to destroy but evil orders. 

That's incredible. They sing not because of some innate ability or need to, they sing to remember what they lost. They took such a risk to take dullform for their people and now have only recently rediscovered some of the forms. They really wanted freedom from these gods and freedom for all people it seems since they were willing to risk war to prevent something happening with gavilar. The gods must be connected to odium somehow.

The ruins of an abandoned kingdom? Sure sounds like theres a connection to Urithiru there somehow.

Yes Eshonai, lots missing out. Hopefully we figure out more as we go along.

It seems Eshonai was part of the original team that gavilar found. Part of an exploration of the world to discover what they had lost in dullform. Interesting.

Humans are always underestimated in their greed. The parshendi have gotten into a long war they never wanted to last and now the young ones are starting to forget the reasoning in the first place and just wanting revenge and an end. So much that they'll take dangerous risks like stormform. Which somehow i suspect will lead to downfall further down the line. 

The spren betray us.... what sort of agreement did they have with the spren and why do they feel the spren betrayed them?! Do they feel only they should have the power? And where's the honor blade left in alethkar. Is it the one szeth had?

Ahhh. So we have confirmation here that Eshonai is the explorer referenced on the back.

Eshonai is right venli. Venli knows way too much to be allowed to potentially lose all those memories. 

Venli is dangerous. Shes impulsive and seems to hold a grudge. Shes gonna do something stupid and its gonna cause chaos.",Stormlight_Archive,WOR I4 readthrough

413,"So I'm reading TWoK and have a question. Basically, when a lashing is used it seems to negate normal gravity. So if I use a basic Lashing on a pencil against the far wall, it falls to that far wall. If normal gravity was still under effect, it would fall diagonally towards both the wall and ground as both forces are working on it. So the lashing has completely removed (or added a force directly opposite as well) normal gravity. 

Now, during an epic fight scene a 1/4 lashing is used to make someone 1/2 as heavy. However, by what is shown above this should just make them fall up towards the ceiling at 1/4 the speed of normal. If this 1/4 lashing means a force of 1/4g is applied in the upwards direction, they would still only weight 3/4 normal. 1g down - 1/4g up. Same with the half lashing later, that would make them weigh 1/2 as much. 

The only way I can work this math out is if a full lashing applies 2g of force, therefore giving a 1/2 lashing a feeling of weightlessness. But then a 20x lashing would give an aceleration of 40x normal. Unless the extra 1g is always applied in the opposite direction of gravity. But if that's true you can never get to 1/2 weight, the best you could do is a 0 lashing that still applies the -1g. 

Am I overthinking this?",Stormlight_Archive,Basic Lashing math
414," I think the Fused that attacked Rysn at the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve was a Regal in smokeform. The quotes say that smokeform is for slipping between men and spying. They also say its like the surges of spren. Both of these sound to me like Lightweaving, and the Fused was clearly using Illumination to create a disguise.

416,"On another go-through of the series, and I took particular note in WoR of an epigraph quote from the in-world book:

""But as for the Bondsmiths, they had members only three, which number was not uncommon for them; nor did they seek to increase this by great bounds, for during the times of Madasa, only one of their order was in continual accompaniment of Urithiru and its thrones. Their spren was understood to be specific, and **to persuade them to grow to the magnitude of the other orders was seen as seditious.**"" (Emphasis mine)

Now, this is widely taken to mean there are three, but it does not explicitly say there can *only* be three, but that to persuade them to exceed it is seditious. And if it wasn't possible, why would it be seditious? How could you even persuade someone of something impossible?

So I've started to think that, while you do of course still need a higher order of spren than even the standard Radiants, there must be more possibilities. Perhaps the larger spren like Cucicesh, or more likely.... the Unmade.

Sanderson could have gone for 11 and still kept the link to the number 10 while also having Odium's number be odious but that seems like there would be too many unmade so I guess the number 9 was a better choice but still, we were on the verge of greatness.",Stormlight_Archive,9 is not an odious number

419,"  

Hi everyone!

I like to consider myself a recreational mathematician and I really enjoy the bits of math that Sanderson sprinkles throughout his books. In anticipation of the new book coming this year, I’ve started a reread of the current books and I’ve been thinking a lot, my friends say too much, about the highstorms. In particular, the mathematics behind them.

**Assumptions I am making:**

The storms travel across the planet, they do not encompass everywhere simultaneously. This means that is a storm is tearing up some village in Alethkar, another village in Jah Keved knows that their time is soon. To simplify the math, I want to know when the storms have appeared at the “Origin”. Once that is known, when a storm is hitting any particular place is a matter of simple arithmetic. So, everything that follows is an effort to know when a storm will spawn at the origin, nothing more.

**Assumptions that I am not making:**

Now, I don’t want to make any assumptions about the math that is known in Roshar. There may not be an isomorphism between the axioms that hold true there and here. So, I’m not trying to recreate any math that a Stormwarden might actually use. Instead, I want to create some math that will model the highstorms using something that a university student might know. We know so little about the storms right now, but we do know some \*very\* important things.

**What we know:**

1. Highstorms are periodic. This means that if we had enough data, if we knew every high storm, we would know exactly when to expect them. As of yet we do not have this data, but with the Rhythm of War on the horizon I’m hoping!

2. That period is finite! We can expect to see the same thing every two years.

**The Math**

This SCREAMS Fourier Series, one of my absolute favorite areas in math. If you have a \*periodic\* function, you can write it as a bunch of sines and cosines. Now, that may not seem interesting, but I’m hoping to change your mind.

But our highstorms data isn’t a function… or is it?! (dun dun dun!) To be the MOST accurate, we would probably want a function that looks at the time second by second. That is some function machine that you could ask, “Hey, is there a highstorm today at 11:54:20? But that is a ton of data. For our example lets assume it is good enough to know if a storm is coming on a particular day. More like, “Hey, magical Fourier series, will there be a storm today?”. Now this is more manageable! Now let’s assume that the period of the storms is 7 days instead of 2 years (our math will scale up to any finite period, we can even refine it to calculate by the milliseconds, so don’t worry!)

**Example**

Let’s say we wrote out each day for a period of 7 days and recorded if there was a highstorm or not. Day one… nothing. So I write a 0 in my list. Day 2, its raining chulls and cremlings… sideways. Mark it down as a 1. Definitely a high storm. Now I go on like this and I come up with a list, and I’m gonna call it x like a good mathematician. Giving something a name is very powerful in math.

X = {0,1,0,0,0,1,0}

Now, we can see that on the second and sixth day, there was a highstorm. Our data is a kind of a function. What is x\[1\], well that is 0. Because the first part of the list is 0. (Don’t get mad at me for not starting to count at 1 instead of 0! Mathematica, the software I work with, is weird like that.) Next up, I can ask what x\[4\] is and I get 0. We have a nice little \*discrete\* function that we can slam in that (discrete) Fourier machine to get some nice trig functions out! Function, I name thee f\[t\]! I’ll glaze over the details for the sake of brevity, but look!

https://imgur.com/a/26QjKCm

The peaks of the graph show highstorms, and everything else is safe. And to follow it up, I can start asking more useful questions like: Will there be a highstorm 20 days from now? All I have to do is know what day we are on in the period, lets say 3. Then what I want to know is if there is a highstorm at day 3 + 20 = 23. So, f\[23\] = 1 means that’s not a good day to go camping!

436,"Was pondering on surge resonances and just wanted to share my ideas and hear other people's :) 

Spoilers for oathbringer

Elsecallers - we've seen jasnah soulcast from a distance aswell as transport a soulcasting from one person to another. Do you think this is just normal soulcasting or a resonance with transportation? How else could they be combined?

Lightweavers - at the end of oathbringer jasnah comments on how shallans illusions seem to have mass behind them and asks shallan about her soulcasting. Does this mean lightweavers can soulcast their illusions? 

Windrunners - I believe the reason windrunners can have so many squires is due to spiritual gravitation and adhesion. I think this is backed up by the skybreakers also having quite a few squires, due to spiritual gravitation, but not as many as the windrunners. Also Kal had been shown to manipulate the wind, could this be a use of both their surges together or just one?

I have a few other thought, mainly on the willshapers but they're mainly based on speculation as we haven't seen alot/ any of their surges.

Spoilers for oathbringer

Windrunners - Kal showed some wind related powers in oathbringer when helping humans into a storm shelter. Could be teasing wind manipulation?

Skybreakers - what looks like a breaking sky? Like huge cracks in the sky? Lightning. Could this be how they use their surge of destruction?

Ashbringers - think they might be all in with using fire and explosions. I can't think how abrasion comes into it but maybe they just prefer destruction, the same way skybreakers mostly only use gravitation.

Elsecallers - we know they can project their mind into shadesmare with soulcasting, what if they could use transportation to project their mind over distances in shadesmare? Allowing them to 'call' important spren in shadesmare without actually leaving utithiru. This would align with their title as chief ambassadors to the spren.

Stonewards - I reckon they will use cohesion to shape and tension to reinforce stone and rock in combat. Willshapers might shape most things but maybe stonewards specialise in shaping stone?

Willshapers - using their will to shape things. Using cohesion to shape matter, with transportation giving them more reach to their shaping as with how jasnah soulcast over distances. But also shaping other people's wills? Dalinar using spiritual adhesion shows that surges can be used across different realms so what if you could use spiritual or cognitive cohesion to shape people's ideas, memories and emotions?

However, in Japanese, for example, the word ""の"" means both ""of"" and ""of the"" (although with order reversed as to English, ""A of B"" =&gt; ""B の A"").

As ""of"" and ""of the"" are very common, I thus wonder if the Alethi language (or even the extended Vorin language family) either does not distinguish between ""of"" and ""of the"", or indicates them only by conjugation (which by the rules of Keteks are allowed to differ), or has a single word equivalent to ""of the"" .",Stormlight_Archive,Alethi language

Ah pattern. Hes coming along quite quickly now. Same as syl, hes growing in his understanding of the world.

Ahh so the liespren are ones that are trying to do something. Syl ran away cus she believed against what honorspren did. Pattern has been sent. Shallan was probably more right than I thought when she said the spren brought them together. Why shallan though? Lies dont explain it. He clearly doesnt have the words yet.

Is this convo with pattern perhaps a hint that shallan had a mental breakdown which led to her blocking the memories and so she tells 'lies' because she literally cannot remember.

Oh my. All her work gone. So sad. For shallan this was her life and her escape. Drawing is a coping mechanism I suspect. 

Spren of Him? Odium spren? I never even considered such an possibility but there are spren for everything. Thats not good news at all.

Ahh it's going through the forms! That's cool to see their mythology about them. 

Interested in my first experience of Adolin's viewpoint. 

Seems like he still has some bitterness. He still feels he has to prove everyone wrong even though hes already done it. I'm glad he's believing like dalinar does though. A good sign indeed.

Ironic that hes thinking about the sword being alive when they can be alive on nalthis. Probably there are some infused swords around roshar due to worldhoppers.

Whats pailiah? Maybe we'll find out. The almighty is their god not this pailiah. 

Oh dear. They have no idea. Guessing they'll find out soon. Unless it is some Jasnah secret plot. Not entirely convinced either way at the minute. Wonder why it's called the shallowed crypts.

What are these new curses?! Battah send? It's cool to enrich the language more but I'm wondering if these are gods or what. 

Its understandable they believe Jasnah is just off on another crazy tangent, but they'll feel so guilty when they find out the truth!

Wow. Seems like adolin at his heart is just lonely and a little insecure. A broken man, like a lot of us.

Chicken?! What the hell has chicken got to do with anything!! But the sword talking makes sense. Clearly there is some experience of a worldhopper from nalthis. I wonder if weve encountered them already or if its in the past.

Theres something about renarin. He keeps popping up but appears to have little to no purpose in the story. Sanderson is keeping him around for something big. I just know it.

I dont know why adolin finds kaladin so off. Kaladin saved dalinar's life and protected him from sadeas' betrayal! 

Man these other lighteyed highprinces are really against dalinar. That's a crazy bet considering how much a shardplate is worth.

My goodness that was brutal. Something just overtook Adolin. It even hinted at it at the end. Another reason to the one Navani was suggesting. Although I suspect she knows this. I don't think Dalinar will be impressed with the way Adolin acted. 

Ahh. Renarin has a full shardbearer armour now! But hes disabled isnt he? So he wouldnt be much good. Therefore I suspect this is the start of something changing in him. Something bigger. There has to be more.

Whispering spren at your ear? What's all that about! Hmmm..intriguing. 

I know pattern is a cryptic/liespren but sanderson sure is pointing out all the lies haha. At least shallan is savvy enough to know tvlakv's true intentions.

Not sure what the weeping is or a light year. Hoping we'll be illuminated further on?!

Seems like shallan is lost in her identity so she tries to use others to get her places. It isnt healthy but it's working with tvlakv here. If she was meek she could get herself into real trouble. 

Sadly shallan, many men treat women like a plaything and it angers me greatly as a man that we could be like that. 

Ok so what just happened? She used stormlight by viewing herself differently, and its healed her feet. So she can lightweave and heal herself?

As I read the last part so quickly, at least compared to how fast I usually read, I missed a couple of details here and there, and I was hoping to get some help.

1) Is it stated that Taravangian was the one that leaked all the information about Dalinar at the end of part 4? I don't really remember it being addressed so I just assumed it was T, as there was a chapter beforehand where he was clearly planning something mysterious against Dalinar.

2) Where did Odium go during the final battle? I remember Dalinar having the whole 'YOU CANNOT HAVE MY PAIN!' moment in front of him, and then (almost) all of the Radiants gathering to face him. But after that, I don't remember Odium retreating or anything like that. I remember I was reading the end and I thought 'where the hell did Odium go?' I was expecting Dalinar to face him after he contained the Thrill, but I guess Odium left during this time, who knows.

479,"I’ve seen many people argue over it and whether or not we should judge him, hate him, etc. We all know why many fans hate Moash, but it’s mostly because he doesn’t want to take responsibility for his actions and keeps blaming others, unlike Dalinar. The other side’s argument is 2 things:

-That he did what he did for human reasons- he felt anger, hatred and resentment towards Elhokar because he was responsible for the death of his grandparents

-The other is that TSA is a story about redemption arc and how there is 7 more books for him to have it

Now listen. I think that it is possible Moash gets a redemption arc, especially in those 7 books (assuming he survives). But the thing is- I don’t want it to happen.

The reason for that is precisely because it is a story about redemption- a lot of people choose not to have it. A lot of people don’t redeem themselves because they truly believe they don’t have what to redeem themselves of. I think Moash will be one of those people in the books and I want to see it done. I enjoyed Dalinar’s story and his inner conflicts, but I also don’t think everyone that has done wrong has thought like that and wanted to do better.

My bet would be on Szeth with his monster weapon, Kal because of his own skill or Nale because he's the only heralds still fighting and have spoken the 5th ideal. 

Still I think that Dalinar would put a hell of a fight against those guys and maybe his new powers are even more powerful that I can imagine.

485,"I wonder if we are going to see more throwing weapons being used and experimented with by the wind runners.  In Kholinar the rock formations are known as the ""wind blades"" and while yes, that could just be a reference to the shape of them, there's also the conversation that Kaladin has with Elhokar as they are approaching the city disguised. Where Elhokar explains that the Alethi lighteyes rule because of the windrunners and the prominance of their order in Kholinar/Alethkar. 

Also, the windrunners surges seem like they would work well with thrown weapons. They could lash blades to fly faster at an enemy and even draw them back to themselves using the reverse lashing.  Kaladin has experience with throwing knives beyond just using the spear and is proficient with them, so I wonder if we'll see his combat technique evolve to take advantage of the lashings.


Random thoughts that go along with this:


Would a thrown shard blade be attracted by a reverse lashing?


Could a boomerang style of spinning blade be made to be more 
effective/controllable with the lashings?


Could a windrunner potentially throw a spray of daggers/arrow heads/metal 
shot and both lash those away at high velocity and then pull them back at high velocity with a reverse lashing?

What about a hybrid weapon such as a short bow where the arrow itself is lashed away from you many multiples of times to make it fly faster/further and hit harder.

What about entangling weapons such as a weight on a chain or rope, being pushed away and then pulled back? It could be combined with a basic lashing to ensure it can't be removed/disconnected on impact and could also be used to help maneuver in the air in tight turns.",Stormlight_Archive,Thoughts on wind runner abilities in combat

This brings me to cognitive shadows. What is a cognitive shadows? How are they made?
In laymen's terms it's a ghost. A person with such a strong connection to the physical realm, that their spirit can't go to the SR, the beyond. How they're made can vary depending on various circumstances. 

I have a theory that just hit me last night. I think it's possible, Kaladin will die after swearing the fourth or fifth ideal. However with his determination to protect those he loves, and the ferocity in which he does, I believe that gives him a very strong tie to the PR. 

Jezrien has been killed. Moash killed him in a very mysterious ways, but it's seems he was killed permanently. 

It doesn't hold much water, even to me, but I think it's possible Kaladin could become the next herald. The herald of windrunners. The new jezerezeh. His determination to protect, especially his younger brother after failing Tien. I feel he's be the character to say fuck your rules, I'm doing what I need. And becomes cognitive shadows.

Venli thinks this spren are actually spirits that have not chosen any body yet, thus they are what we know as voidbringer or fused (if they possess a singer body). Ok.
Are this spirits the same as the ones waiting in Shadesmar where Kaladin and the others are? Are this spirits the ones that possess Amaram's army?

491,"Ok so I was re-reading The Way of Kings today because 1. I had some time to kill and 2. It is one of my most favorites books ever. And I just realized something about Kaladin and his Shash brands, ok so correct me if I am wrong but Shash brand is given to slaves deemed to be dangerous.

And I know given the socioeconomic conditions of darkeyes and aspects of slavery depicted in the books, it is humiliating to have such a brand.

But come to think about it in a different light, it boils down to my boy kaladin walking around with literally DANGER written in his forhead. I mean COME ON ! This is a damn power move if there was any in the book. Just think about it, his journey and all that he's been through, from a soldier to a slave,  assigned to a bridge crew, to squad leader of bridge 4, to a frigging Knight Radiant. I mean come on even after obtaining surgebinding his scars haven't healed.

But bear with me, the dude climbed through hell, he was a wretch staring into that abyss ( you know the scene I am talking about ) a man waiting to die, and yet he pulled himself from the precipice and kept running and running until he claimed the skies themselves, windrunner indeed. This man is danger incarnate and after all that he's been through the guy deserves to be prancing around with a face tattoo saying DANGER.

In book 2 ( if I am not wrong) he convinced dalinar to remove him from the chain of command. So even a lighteye can't order him around. By the end of book 2 people knew he was a knight radiant. In book 3 when the soldiers in hearthstone were being asshats the guy literally pulled Sylblade out to shut their traps. (Power move again biatch !). 

So all in all I wanna say moving forward even if he can't heal his scars, it's fine. He can own it, all of it, his despair,  pain, sorrow to his triumph, his joy and everything in between.

494,"Alot of talk has been posted about the nature of Kaladin's 4th ideal and what exactly he will say. Most of us seem to believe it will have to do with him admitting that he cannot save everyone due to a bunch of hints BrandoSando has left hidden around. 

My take on all of this came after reading another person's post on here about the brands on Kal's forehead. Clearly, he still sees himself as some sort of a slave as indicated by the brands not healing, and his body rejecting the ""freedom"" glyph. 

I think it is obvious that at some point these brands will heal and the tattoo will be accepted. Why? Well let's talk about the 4th ideal. If you accept that the 4th ideal is somewhere along the lines of accepting that you cannot save everyone or moving on from the ones you couldn't, then I think Kaladin will swear that ideal, but with a twist: 
""I could not save everyone, including myself""
With the revelation that he couldn't save himself, I believe will come the understanding that just because things happened to him, does not mean that he deserves it. This should lead to him accepting that he is truly free.

Why is that a curse you ask... because it led him into making the Diagram, and causing the death and suffering of millions of people. BUT... if he saves the world it will all be worth it right? Wrong...

Because what he will do to save the world has nothing to do with the Diagram or his actions up until that moment.

I believe it will come to a point where Taravagian will be in a position in one of his compassionate days to take an action that will save the world. BUT the catch is that he would be in that position regardless of the Diagram or his deal with Odium.

It's that time again! And I see we have Eshonai again and Taln and zahel/vasher! Itll be interesting to her the perspective of a Herald and Vasher to see if we get more info on what both are truly up to.

First up Eshonai! And it seems a storm is a brewing! 

Woo. A meeting will occur! Hopefully this totally changes things upside down. They're gonna have to come together if they all wanna survive the next desolation.

A captured spren?😱 I didnt remember the previous interludes mentioning captured spren. I thought stormform was discovered by venli.

After discussion with a fellow reader it has been determined that the capture must have occured off screen and wasnt really mentioned but was kind of assumed. I didnt realise they captured spren at all. It thought they just bonded but I learnt something new!!

And after looking back at the previous interludes I now see that the spren was captured and shown as such and they talked about the process of bonding for forms. Interesting thing of note is that they said if Eshonai comes out in anything other than dullform itll be a success. Does this suggest perhaps that dullform is the form taken when a form transformation is incomplete? Like in &gt;!Elantris!&lt;
Anyway let's move on haha. But you do get my full thoughts reading through!

The stormfather is a spren?! Wow. Okay. That's quite big. I'd always assumed he was another God like the almighty. Hes different to other spren because he doesnt appear like them. Is he somehow related to honor? Syl refers to him as father, and the honorspren came from, well, honor! And honor speaks to dalinar through the storms. Is the stormfather perhaps a conduit of Tanavast like &gt;!the mists were a conduit for preservation&lt;! How did he betray the listeners I wonder. He clearly took the human side in some kind of disagreement. But what?

The listeners were of the storms.a big hint at their origins. But how a storm could create a being, I dont know. I suspect there is something else hidden in here. And if the stormfather is a spren and there is also stormspren how does that work..is the stormfather the storm itself?

Went down a bit of a spren rabbit hole there with a friend but essentially I got that there are tiers of spren. Not all of them are linked to shards. still a little confused on the purpose of the stormfather whilst in the storm. Hopefully this gets answered. But I did find out hes linked to honor. So I was right!
Wasnt told how though. The mystery still remains. 

Omg is she bonding with something of odium? Eshonai identifies it as angerspren but we know odium is of hate. Either way its baaaad. 

And why does the stormfather appear? Is he part of the process or is he just here for a courtesy call😂😂? Apologising for what siding with the humans has led to. I wonder what the dispute was over. Oh and he is clearly restricted by something from acting. Unsure what yet. 

Zahel

Anyway onto vasher, I mean Zahel *wink wink*! This one should be shorter I promise haha.

Very curious. Now we are getting interludes that take place in the main story. 

Its funny seeing all the references to Zahel being a little unusual and how he references the monks as if he isnt part of them. And the colour metaphors. At this point it's so obvious. 

Glad kaladin is gonna get trained

Is that a reference to nightblood being in his head? Clearly he lost nightblood a while back.

Taln
I've been waiting for his return since the end of WoK! So many plot threads left going. glad we finally arrived here.

Wow he must be kinda salty that he got left in hell. It sounds awful.

The gift? The man is mad! He speaks in riddles. Who has he been brought to?

Ah wit! When will we see you again my friend? I miss your quality banter. I wonder what mission he ran off to for in the hills.

Ahh its Elhokar. Curious.

Well at least he speaks. And he knows what he has to warn of. Although it appears that he is unaware of the breaking of the oath pact. Is this what has caused madness? And what is bronze useful against? Is he even taln? Or is it some trick. Hmm...

Hmm. I guess being a herald, his shardblade is different to the ones around today? I wonder if we'll get an explanation as to why his blade doesn't disappear.

Dalinar too apparently! This must worry him greatly if a herald has truly returned. 

Too late. I dont like the sound of that.

Eshonai

Well she hasn't changed too much it seems. I was half expecting her to be some crazy monstrosity unrecognisable. Shes just got some new armour. Kinda cool. 

Wow ok she has more strength. Kinda cool she can just leap like that now.

Ohh shit. She has red eyes. Is she being controlled by Odium? Is that why she so clearly sees what they need to do? Because shes being told what to do. Uh oh.

Part 3 here we go! Seems like we're gonna get into the meat of the main plot now.

Quick aside note. Not sure what this art is on the left here. Guess we'll find out! Something to do with gems.

Aha. So we are getting an insight into the in world book. Didnt really tell me anything I didnt know but good to break it down again. I wonder when the book will show up in world again. I seem to remember jasnah mentioning it early on and then its disappeared from mention since.

Quick look back tells me it was lost in the ocean! Maybe it shows up again. If jasnah is alive maybe she has it. Someone must have a copy since the epigraphs are revealing it! It was about lightweaving specifically iirc so itll be good to get more specific info on shallan and her powers.

Simultaneous infusion. So someone, probably Adolin considering the chapter symbols, is gonna be using multiple infused objects?

Ahhh. So it is possible to drop a shardblade and still keep it from poofing away. Curious. I wonder how long one could maintain that for.

Ahh great. I understand why adolin is doing these things, but I worry paranoia will take over. Kaladin is gonna be in his sights after what hes seen, and that scares me.

Hmm. I knew there was a bond between bearer and blade, but I had no idea mental commands were possible. Maybe theres more to the shardblades that have been lost since the heralds left. And if the bearer bonds to the blade, perhaps they bond to the plate too in a way? It is infused with stormlight after all. But lesser bond than the blade because anyone can take the plate. Maybe this is the simultaneous infusion . how they bond to the blade idk. Cus bonding is for spren and a blade isnt a spren. Havent seen any shardblade spren either. Hmmm. Another mystery.

Tbh I agree with a lot of Adolin's comments here. I'm glad Renarin is sticking unless for kal. Perhaps he can see the connection shared by them because they have similar sort of issues about self worth and struggles to fit in. But kaladin has become more unlikeable in this book. Perhaps because he is surrounded by people who have looked down on him his entire life and so he is subconsciously making a statement.

It seems the blade bond is very similar to other forms of investiture on Roshar. Maybe because of the connection to the spiritual realm, perception and intention are absolutely key. And this seems to be a theme across the cosmere, about the way we present ourselves and the way we perceive ourselves. I like it. These books make you think.

Adolin seems to have had a total knock of confidence in his abilities because he feels guilty over not being able to protect against the assassin. And this is affecting his abilities because he needs to have confidence in himself to be able to perform well. Very well portrayed sanderson.

Well at least we have written confirmation Adolin isnt a complete ass😂 glad he respects all regardless of eye colour. I can understand his concerns regarding structure. You do need organisation and control to run a society effectively. However kaladin is only one and a special case. He could save them all.

Was it ever explained how the ardents can soulcast?we know the fabrials have gems with spren in, but the ardents dont bond to them because thay would make them all lightweavers or the order shallan is which I've either forgotten or isn't revealed yet. 

Yeah what's going on with them haha. Weird stuff. Are they turning into like gems themselves or stone? Is this like a &gt;!spook in mistborn situation where they use the magic so much it physically affects them?&lt;!

Yeah why is the wind blown inwards? Is it to signify that they aren't pulling a wall out of nowhere, they're changing the makeup of the air into a stone wall. What kinda spren can do that without bonding? I'd like more explanation on how it works and what kinda spren are used.

Ah man. Adolin is catching on. This is either good or very bad for kaladin!

Yes a Navani viewpoint! This should be interesting.

Ahhh so this is what the drawing was about. No idea what the test could be though.

Is that an excerpt from the interlude from WoK on that island with the flamespren? Are we gonna discover more why the flamepren cant change forms if dimensions are written down and why its unique to flamspren?

Even Navani thinks Jasnah is alive. I bet ya she will pop up with the answers to the voidbringers right near the end.

Yeah I'm kinda confused as to what Navani is doing here.whats she testing exactly? Is she trying to recreate gravitation? But shes used mechanical means so what difference does thay make? I'm a bit lost hehe.

Ahhhh. Makes sense now and the chapter title too. I'm glad sanderson realises we aren't all masters hehe. That advantage in battle would be enormous. And you could see further too, gaining a wider vantage point on your enemy. Very clever.

508,"So the first 4 stormlight book abbreviations are ‘tWoK WoR O RoW’ and in one of Sanderson’s live-streams he says the first 5 book abbreviated titles are a palindrome. Which means that the last title will be ‘KoWt’ which will be in total ‘tWoK WoR O RoW KoWt’. Now what I want to know is, it what is the next title after Rhythm of War? So I believe that the first word might be Knight or Knights, the second likely is ‘of’ what do you guys think? I’m really curious. We probably won’t find out until late 2020 or early 2021",Stormlight_Archive,So what’s the title of StormLight 5?
509,"*Disclaimer, I'm doing an OB reread (first time audio) and more or less just posting thoughts*

Who the fuck is Shallan? If you were to describe Shallan where would you even start? Would you include Veil and Radiant in your description? Or would you focus on 'Shallan' the character? Maybe begin with traits that seem to be consistent throughout her character? The longer I think about it, the trickier it becomes to find a good answer. A good potential starting point would be to draw a distinction between 'Shallan' the identity, and Shallan the person. For now I'll refer to the person Shallan as AlphaShallan (ASha). ASha is the entity, the essence, the being that we know as Shallan. So who is Shallan? I think it's fair to say that Shallan is another identity that AShal created for herself.

""'I thought Brightness Shallan was the persona. But the spy-that's the false identity.' 'Wrong, they're both equally false.'"" (OB 627)

“The real her was a bruised and sorry thing, painted over all pretty, but inside a horrid mess.” (OB 760)

If Shallan is ‘fake,’ if it’s just another identity she’s using to cover her true self, then I have a few important questions. What hurt ASha in a way that she had to create Shallan to protect herself? When was Shallan ‘born?’ Who is ASha really? Why doesn’t ASha remember anything?

From here I’d like to step back to look at some theories and WoBs relating to Shallan (dropping ASha term for a minute). [First](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/156/#e2846) is a matter of Shallan’s oaths and her armor. A common theory is that Shallan has already spoken enough truths to receive her Shardplate; and the reason we (probably) haven’t seen it yet is because she’s buried parts of her memory so deeply she doesn’t even seem to know she’s forgotten it. It’s almost as if the person who swore those oaths was a completely different person from the Shallan we know. [This](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/324/#e9309) certainly begs the question, when did she speak these oaths and when did she ‘reverse’ them?

The various threads I have criss crossing my mind are starting to weave together. What if, the identity ‘Shallan’ is ASha’s armor. It seems reasonable to speculate that Shallan was created to protect her true self from some kind of pain or trauma. Obviously a metaphysical identity is not comparable to Shardplate, but I can’t help but feel something there. ASha has Shardplate, Brightness Radiant may even have plate (since Shallan might imagine her as a full knight with plate and would have her wear it subconsciously), but Shallan doesn’t. Perhaps Shallan was created to shield herself from truths she could not handle?

I’m just excited to slowly learn more about Shallan’s past and to watch her grow. There are simply too many mysteries still surrounding her and her family. Questions on her mother, the abundance of spren activity in House Davar, including the Unmade, and the Ghostbloods. I’m glad there is at least a [WoB](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/367/#e11634) confirming that Lin Davar is Shallan’s biological father. Even with that confirmation, I’m suspicious. With Hoid there are no coincidences, and I don’t think it was pure chance that led him to tell the story of Mishim and Tsa when Shallan found him in Kholinar. Nor was it coincidence that the exact moment he noticed Shallan was when Tsa and Mishim traded places. Perhaps this was a reference to Shallan’s deceptions and multiple personalities. Or perhaps there is a larger connection between Shallan and the origin story of the Natan people.",Stormlight_Archive,Who is Shallan?

526,"Been awhile since my last post where [I gave my thoughts on chapters 1-32.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/fbixy0/new_reader_read_up_till_chapter_32/) Thankfully I've had time to finally finish the book and give my overall thoughts on this first entry of the Stormlight Archives. 

This is less a review but more so just my raw, rambling thoughts on everything I've read so forgive me if I've forgotten anything majorly prevalent to the book.

  
*Viewpoint trio:*  


My views on Kaladin have definitely changed for the better - earlier on, whilst empathizing with his character arc I always felt everything else the book had to offer significantly overshadowed the role he was playing at any given time. However, the moment he was strung up to be killed via the *Highstorm* was when I perked up and really became interested in Kaladin and what his viewpoints offered. The whole ordeal with the *Stormfather* alongside his groggy memory of Syl fighting off the *painspren* was fantastic - I remember the *Stormfather* mentioning that he's the *Child of Tanavast,* wonder what that means. Kaladin's ethical values (as I became more interested in his character) started coming full circle when we found out how the light-eyes treated him throughout his life; Roshone and Amaram specifically. I was always unsure where I personally stood with the arbitrary dichotomy between the light-eyes and dark-eyes but Kaladin's disdain for the light-eyes was pretty justified. I'm not sure if it was ever brought up but I would have liked to see him take the step to questioning the social class system as a whole rather than *just* succumbing to hating his enemies - maybe that happens in later books, we'll see. Now, *easily* my favourite aspect of Kaladin's character was the bond with *Bridge Four*, from Rock to Teft to Lopen, in conjunction with his exemplary leadership that helped them evolve into disciplined soldiers. Syl showing up in adult form to sway Kaladin into helping Dalinar was really interesting, I'm starting to wonder if *spren* are an extension of humans innate desires? Was so gratifying at the end of the book for him to finally meet, what he romanticized as a kid, a light-eyes who wasn't morally bankrupt in Dalinar. I just loved his utter disbelief at what he was witnessing.

I really had fun with Shallan's point of view chapters because I just **like** Shallan the person. She's pretty whimsical and seems like she has a heart of gold but what we learn of her past as well as the justifications she uses throughout the book portrays her to be a sharper person than alluded to. The good girl actually being bad trope I've seen done ad nauseam but with Shallan, it was the fact that she was always going back and forth over whether she was justifiable in her actions and giving weight to either side of any argument. So anytime she made a decision, for better of for worse, it was always fun seeing her reaction to it. However, I felt there was a bit of cognitive dissonance with Shallan's reaction to jasnah killing the 3 men who attacked them in contrast to what we learn retroactively; that she was her father's killer. Why was she so torn at the *concept* of murder if she already witnessed it? Was she just trying to rationalize her attempt at stealing the *Soulcaster*? This makes me think Shallan has deeper problems than this book dived into (yes, I remember her weird brother who enjoyed killing creatures to pass time, lol). I had an inkling that Kabsal wasn't everything he presented himself to be but I did feel for Shallan insofar as her first attempt of love (a concept she could barely understand) came in the form of an assassin who really just wanted to kill Jasnah. Two of my favourite revelations happen in Shallan's viewpoint: that Jasnah can use *Soulcasting* without a fabrial and that the *Parshendi/parshmen* **were** the *Voidbringers (*I actually put the book down and had to think about this reveal for a few of mins). I have numerous questions over *Shadesmar.*

The best character of the book - Dalinar Kholin himself. One of my favourite character traits in fiction is determination and how far authors go to test the limits of it; and this is where I feel like Dalinar shined. His dogged attitude to serving the *Alethi Codes of War* and the passages of *the Way of Kings* were constantly challenged and he wasn't vindicated until he felt the repercussions of his decisions first. Though what really warmed me to his character was his mature way of handling these things after being questioned by his son, Adolin (who I found to be one of my favourites in the book). I think Dalinar stands as a good example of being someone that wants to be **well-intentioned** whilst being flexible enough to understand that different scenario's need a bit more flexibility without throwing your whole moral system out the window. The visions...arguably my favourite part of the book. I'm assuming the vision with the *Radiants* putting down their *Shardblades* was the *Recreance.* I don't remember if there was any implied reason, during the scene, as to why the *Radiants* stopped fighting though I feel like there's more of a metaphorical meaning to the humans fighting over the *Shardblades.* I had no qualms over Dalinar's ""gullibility"" in trusting Sadeas over the plateau assault; just like Dalinar, I believed Sadeas was sincere in his efforts to help Dalinar after he helped acquit him over Elhokar's saddle. Seeing Sadeas eat his words as Dalinar came back to the war-camp was completely satisfying with Dalinar then trading *Oathbringer* for the bridgeman - nothing but respect. His conversation with the *Stormfather* seemed arguably the most important scene in the book; I was wondering since he's dead, why are their *Highstorms?* Is it an aftereffect of his death or the last remaining residue from his ethereal body? 

  
*Others:*  


Szeth's journey (like I mentioned in my previous post) is one I'm completely intrigued in. However, the most enjoyment I got from his viewpoint towards the end of the book was the reveal that King Tavarangian wasn't a senile fool and was actually the one who wrote the kill-list. I really liked the scene with the dying people as it finally tied into the chapter epigraphs. It's actually a smart (and rather twisted) strategy by Taravangian which piques my interest in his character. King's Wit...need I say more. His personality just oozes off the page whenever he's in the scene and knowing he's Hoid (who I remember made brief but insignificant appearances in Elantris and Mistborn) makes me excited for his future screen-time - I absolutely loved the scene with Kaladin where he tells the story of *Derethil and the Wandersail.* The epilogue ends with a bang as one of the *Heralds* returns in the shape of Talenel'Elin who proclaims the *Desolation* isn't far off. Was he in *Damnation* ever since the scene in the prelude? There was a couple of other scene's in the book, mostly in the interludes, that I don't have much of an opinion on for now.

Ok so this epigraph totally confused me haha. I had to reread several times to understand what it said. From what I worked out the dustbringers are seen as similar to voidbringers. I wonder what surges they have that are seen as so dangerous. Clearly if radiants were being compared to voidbringers then something isn't quite right.

I'm glad shallan seems to be making a definitive start point. This is a new Shallan and shes gonna grow even more. Of course she isnt fully there yet but a decisive moment like this will, i imagine, be key to her journey.

Interesting moment with pattern here. I suspect shallan's growing confidence in lightweaving is building the bond, like with syl. It's now at the point pattern can just about have some physical contact with things. 

Well I'm glad Vathah has stopped being so antagonistic. Hes probably a little in awe and a little afraid. Good.

Seems similar with macob. Although he was more amenable before anyway. I wonder if this respect has come at a price for shallan. Respect from fear. Is that what she really wants?

Pattern is right. It is interesting to discuss even if it's an uncomfortable topic. Or maybe I'm just too much of a deep thinker for my own good!

Ooh shallan. Is that a hint of events happening soon?!

Hehe. Seems similar to the reactions from the Edmond's Fielders in books 1 and 2 of the Wheel Of Time! On the serious side, I have been waiting for this moment for ages! Glad its here. 

Wow. She's so convinced that the listeners are voidbringers even her viewpoint treats it as such! Maybe stormform are the voidbringers. But parshmen alone? Nope. I dont buy it.

Interesting parallel between kal and shallan here. They both started with nothing and ended up with an army of soldiers following them. I wonder if that is intentional.

Wow. When you lay it out like that, it truly is a lot going on. Its mad how small and intimate Sanderson's books feel whilst still being wide and epic and theres so many threads at once, but I never usually feel lost in it all. It just adds to the grand web Sanderson is spinning. All those tasks have questions I've wanted answered for a while so I hope we get at least some movement on that front.

Can spren get tired? Idk. We haven't seen them get tired really. It's an interesting question, if not an important one.

Well at least it seems the highprinces are listening to Elhokar still. For now. I wonder if we'll come across Taln again in the war camps. Probably not but it would be fun. I'm sorta hoping Wit turns up again!

Vathah making assumptions about shallan again. No wonder shallan is self conscious about what people will think of her. To be fair he wont have encountered a woman with a shardblade before. I wonder if shallan is right and someone has gotten close to a king by being a woman with a shardblade.

Yeah these discussions on truth and lies fascinate me. I'm not entirely sure what I believe. Being a hero is objective. Bluth didnt fit the stereotype but subjectively he could be considered a hero. Same with shallan here. It is a different truth because truth isnt always a fixed determination. Sometimes truth is fluid. Thays why discussions like this are so interesting but also hard to grasp!

When shes drawing on those emotions and pouring them into the pencil, I wonder if thays literal. She did breathe in stormlight after all, and its heavily hinted that her artistic and memory abilities are linked to her radiant abilities.

Hehe. Funny that 16 guards are there considering its importance as a number to the cosmere.

These guards arent very good if they just let her pass! I wonder if it's something to do with the stormlight she breathed in and lightweaving. Either way that security isnt very tight! Luckily for everyone Shallan is a good kid.

This reminds me of the king in the tower for some reason. The story Wit told that foreshadowed the ending of WoK. Idk why. I hope.it isnt subconscious foreshadowing of the death of Elhokar, trapped in his tower. I wanna know what spren hes seeing!

Man this room seems tense haha. I predict by the end of the book its gonna be all out war. No uniting these highprinces. Dalinar against sadeas and his followers. I hope he defeats that rat of a man.

Haha Haha. Oh I'm dead haha. Kaladin thinks shallan is still a horn eater. Too funny. And then shes already killed Tyn. Boy I had a good laugh at that little part of this chapter haha. Just got me. 

Oh dear. I kinda feel bad gaz is arrested now. But at the same time he was kaladin's tormentor! Strange how time and circumstances can change perspectives so much.

I hope dalinar believes shallan. I don't want her being chucked out because dalinar believes she's dead.

Well that was a match and a half. Two strong willed characters! Is it just me or did I detect a hint of romantic tension in that?

Dont listen to Gaz Shallan! Seriously everyone seems to be getting the wrong impressions of people and its worrying me that characters wont work with eachother cus they'll start to believe the lies!!

37

There must be a reason these specific quotes are chosen but nothing stands out so far. But we get more of a view on another order and Taln. Clearly he stands for virtue and standing up for what you believe in but can be stubborn. I wonder if that's changed now hes seemingly driven insane by the torture.

Ngl i had forgotten fabrials aren't just used for soulcasting.

Well, clearly Adolin is a bit of a pessimist. I think something could be done. Probably. Hopefully!!

Good thing to know that they havent forgotten about the other assassinations. Taravangian was a very naughty boy! Speaking of whom, where is he? And what did half shard shields mean? I've forgotten haha.

What a funny description for Relis. He sounds like the usual highprince. Full of himself and only in the position due to chance of birth.

Oh dear. Another one of Adolin's past conquests. He better treat shallan well or I'll knock him over the head myself. 

Adolin really doesnt think much of this guys looks haha. Probably because his ex is there and hes a bit jealous.

An honest mistake? Fuck me, how is having sex with a sister an honest mistake?!!!

Is he still seriously trying to pull off their plan? Its fighting a losing battle. Sadeas has a masterful grip over the others. I mean that many shard blades to play for is almost obscene.

Ouchie. This Relis really is out to get Adolin. Insulting Dalinar like that is cowardly. He should've taken the offer.

I swear the room gets colder whenever I read a bit with sadeas in it! Hes just a squirmy little weasel, playing the kholin's against their own rules of honour despite having a considerable lack of it himself. Alethi society is very odd like adolin points out.

I'm still slightly frustrated amaram hasn't been addressed much yet. It was played as such a cliffhanger to the end of part one and then not much has been done. Its the only thing I've been disappointed by so far. A lot is going on, but it seems this plot thread which I would think to be key to kaladin's development is just being put aside. I dont like how he just walks around and acts honorable. That man is a bastard. Even his comments here to adolin are a sly hint at his true nature. He can pretend to have good intentions but he'll get there however he thinks is justified. Dalinar has to deal with him. 

Oh my. Adolin has fallen for Shallan already. That was fast haha.",Stormlight_Archive,WOR readthrough 36 and 37

546,"I'm personally way more invested in the Heralds and their fates than i am for any of the other characters.

The Heralds are the most heroic and courageous figures in the series, they are the best humanity had to offer. It makes their fall into madness and despair so much more crushing. Suffering torture for Millenia, only to return, build and see it all crumble again before returning to damnation.


The death of Jezrien was probably the most impactful moment in the series for me. This man was once the greatest man who ever lived, Herald of Kings and the hope of all mankind. Now a drunk beggar, mad, broken and killed by the hands of a human who would have never existed if not for his hundreds of sacrifices.  (It was also more important to me because i had misunderstood and thought he was the one left in damnation alone - the last oathkeeping Herald - it didn't occur to me they would all go mad despite being relatively fine at the end of the last desolation)

But still, you could lose an entire kingdom worth of people and it would still be far less devastating than the death of one broken, now useless Herald.

I just feel that Kaladin, Shallan and Danilor's experiences and pain don't carry anywhere near the same weight. Plus i realised at some point they had put on plot armour, which offers far greater protection than shard plate ever did. Side note, do you think all the Heralds are destined to die, or will they be survive/be replaced. I can see Kaladin becoming a Herald, particularly since the Herald of the Windrunners is the only dead Herald.",Stormlight_Archive,[Spoilers] Am i the only one who cares for the Heralds more than the main characters?

When gemstones are used in soul casting, there is a chance that the gemstone will shatter rendering it useless. My question is, how does this work? If the gemstone just fell apart, the smaller pieces could still hold storm light just fine, and from the descriptions we get of this happening, it’s less a shatter and more a break into pieces kind of thing.

So, does the gem shatter to dust? Does it just break and the smaller pieces can be used? Or does something change spiritually or cognitively to make it so that the gem is no longer viable? Is there a WoB on this?",Stormlight_Archive,How do shattered gemstones work?

564,"So there was something that was bugging me and I decided to look at certain things. And here is my main thoughts.

First, take this quote from that &gt;!Dysian Aimian!&lt; 'cook' in the Akinah interlude (Oathbringer, Interlude I-4, ""Kaza"")

&gt; “I cannot speak,” the cook said, “even to sate a dying demand. There are those who could pull secrets from your soul, and the cost would be the ends of worlds. Sleep now, Soulcaster. This is the most merciful end I could give.

Now my theory is, that it happens with sort of connection to the Spiritual Realm, and a way to, at the very least, hear and speak to the dead. In fact, I'm confident one character does that consistently in the books.

Dalinar.
____________________________________________________

For some examples, take this (Oathbringer, Chapter 59, ""Bondsmith"")

&gt; ...In the back of Dalinar’s mind, he heard that same insistent voice. The one he’d heard from the beginning of the visions.

&gt; *Unite them.*

&gt; “I’m trying,” Dalinar whispered.

&gt; Why couldn’t he ever convince anyone peacefully? Why couldn’t he get people to listen without first pounding them bloody—or, conversely, shocking them with his own wounds? He sighed, leaning back and resting his head against the stones of the broken
temple.

&gt; *Unite us. Please.*

In this last one, the implication is 'Dalinar heard the souls of the stones speaking'. Which is pretty interesting. But I think there's more. Take this quote (Oathbringer, Chapter 111, ""Eila Steele"")

&gt; *Unite them.* A voice whispered the words in Dalinar’s mind, echoing with the same resonant sound from months ago, when Dalinar had first started seeing the visions.

&gt; “I’m doing so,” Dalinar whispered back.

&gt; *Unite them.*

&gt; “Stormfather, is that you? Why do you keep saying this to me?”

&gt; *I said nothing.*

&gt; It was growing hard to distinguish between his own thoughts and what came from the Stormfather. Visions and memories struggled for space in Dalinar’s brain...

This very clearly tells us that there's voices Dalinar hears that do not come from the Stormfather. So where? Take this quote from a very appropriately named chapter (Oathbringer, Chapter 88, ""Voices"")

&gt; ...The king thought him a drunkard, but Dalinar indulged only on occasion. On bad days. Drink quieted the sounds of people crying in the back of his mind. 

&gt; Weeping. Children burning. Begging their fathers to save them from the flames. And Evi’s voice, accompanying them all …

It sounds like Dalinar could hear the dead. This theme continues throughout Oathbringer, where Dalinar keeps hearing screams and voices, presumably lamentations of those he killed. But, take this, just before the Unity moment (Oathbringer, Chapter 119, ""Unity"")

&gt; What are you?” she whispered as he stood with arms outstretched, holding to the lands of mind and spirit.

&gt; He closed his eyes, breathing out, listening to a sudden stillness. And within it a simple, quiet voice. A woman’s voice, so familiar to him.

&gt; *I forgive you.*

The way that's worded, I don't think it's just Dalinar's guilt or madness. I think Dalinar can actually talk to the dead, and hear their voices already. A big Chekov's Gun here is the unexplained Nohadon vision. A few quotes from there (Oathbringer, Chapter 103, ""Hypocrite"")

&gt; He heard them again. The tears of the dead. Evi. The children. Flames burning a city. He heard the fire roar in delight at the feast

&gt; ...

&gt; “This … is different from the other visions,” Dalinar said. “What’s going on?”

&gt; ...

&gt; “This is quite the nightmare you’ve created,” Nohadon said. “What does that thunderclast represent, I wonder?”

&gt; “Pain,” Dalinar said, backing away from the monster. “Tears. Burdens. I’m a lie, Nohadon. A hypocrite.”

&gt; “Sometimes, a hypocrite is nothing more than a man who is in the process of changing.”

&gt; Wait. Hadn’t Dalinar said that? Back when he’d felt stronger? More certain? Other thumps sounded in the city. Hundreds of them. Creatures approaching from all sides, shadows in the sun.

&gt; “All things exist in three realms, Dalinar,” Nohadon said. “The Physical: what you are now. The Cognitive: what you see yourself as being. The Spiritual: the perfect you, the person beyond pain, and error, and uncertainty.”

I think Dalinar here actually talked to Nohadon. Not seeing a Honor-memory, but talk to Nohadon as he exists, in the Spiritual Realm. So he has a direct connection to souls in that Realm, and is already talking directly to them.

Not sure what the dream itself is (Dalinar goes to Spiritual Realm or brings Nohadon from that Realm here temporarily), but it's clear this is not just a vision, something Stormfather clarifies later (Oathbringer, Chapter 107, ""The first step"")

&gt; “I’m sorry, regardless, for what I did. Were you … involved in that dream I had? The one with Nohadon?”

&gt; *I know of no such dream.*

&gt; “It was vivid,” Dalinar said. “More surreal than one of the visions, true, but captivating.”

And I think we already were given all the hints to put it all together when Szeth had been hearing voices. He'd heard them all his life and assumed it's some sort of madness (Mistborn spoilers &gt;!Zane hearing ""God"" anyone?!&lt;) (Oathbringer, Chapter 90, Reborn)

&gt; *I know. But you were wrong, and so I had to tell you. Hey, the voices seem quiet today. That’s nice, isn’t it?* 

&gt; Mentioning it brought the whispers to Szeth’s attention. Nin had not healed Szeth’s madness. He’d called it an effect of Szeth’s connection to the powers, and said that he was hearing trembles from the Spiritual Realm. Memories of the dead he’d killed.

Why can Szeth hear the voices, I am not sure. It could be related to his spirit's reattachment, but he'd heard voices before his death too. So my guess is ""It's related to Adhesion, which he accessed because of Jezrien's Honorblade"". The reason I think so is because I think Kaladin can also hear voices from the past.

Now Kaladin already suffers from depression and has voices in his head (The entire ""You don't deserve happiness"" thoughts), so this gets muddled a lot. But I think we get hints about it a couple times at least. (The Way of Kings, Chapter 32, ""Side carry"")

&gt; *Gotta do what you can to stay alive, a voice from his past seemed to whisper. Turn a liability into an advantage…*

On itself, it doesn't say much. But as a whole, a reasonable guess could be ""This power is from (Spiritual) Adhesion, where somehow you can 'bind the dead souls' back into this Realm to hear them"".

_____________________________________________________

And now, for a non sequitor, let's look at Shardblades and dead spren. (Words of Radiance, Chapter 87, ""Riddens"")

&gt; “So they’re all spren,” he said. “Shardblades.”

&gt; Syl grew solemn.

&gt; “Dead spren,” Kaladin added.

&gt; “Dead,” Syl agreed. “Then they live again a little when someone summons them, syncing a heartbeat to their essence.”

&gt; “How can something be ‘a little’ alive?”

&gt; “We’re spren,” Syl said. “We’re forces. You can’t kill us completely. Just . . . sort of.”

&gt; “That’s perfectly clear.”

&gt; “It’s perfectly clear to us,” Syl said. “You’re the strange ones. Break a rock, and it’s still there. Break a spren, and she’s still there. Sort of. Break a person, and something leaves. Something changes. What’s left is just meat. You’re weird.”

So Shardblades are dead spren, but only somewhat. And that 10 heartbeats is their revival. And therefore, Maya (Adolin's shardblade) was slightly less than dead when he summoned her earlier than that. (Oathbringer, Chapter 120, ""The Spear that would not break"")

&gt; He felt something. A stirring on the wind.

&gt; “You want to fight it, don’t you?” Adolin asked. “It reminds you of when you
were alive.”

&gt; Something tickled his mind, very faint, like a sigh. A single word:
*Mayalaran*. A … name?

&gt; ...

&gt; Maya brushed his mind.

&gt; ...

&gt; He fell to his knees.

&gt; Seven.

&gt; Maya! he thought, truly desperate. Please!

&gt; Blessedly, as he raised his hands, the Blade materialized.

All of these are well known facts and theories. Dead spren will probably be revived. Why I mention it again is because of this familiar unexplained moment from the Adolin disadvantaged duel (The Words of Radiance, Chapter 57, ""To Kill the Wind"")

&gt; Kaladin skidded to his knees in the sand, momentum carrying him forward a short
distance as the Blade fell. He raised his hands and snapped them together.

&gt; Catching the Blade.

&gt; Screaming.

&gt; Why could he hear screaming? Inside his head? Was that Syl’s voice? It reverberated through Kaladin. That horrible, awful screech shook him, made his muscles tremble. He released the Shardblade with a gasp, falling backward. Relis dropped the Blade as if bitten. He backed away, raising his hands to his head. “What is it? What is it! No, I didn’t kill you!” He shrieked as if in great pain, then ran
across the sands and pulled open the door to the preparation room, fleeing inside. Kaladin heard his screams echoing inside the hallways there long after the man vanished.

For some reason, not only could Kaladin hear the dead spren-Shardblade, but somehow let Relis hear it too. It could be completely unrelated, but I see parallels to Dalinar hearing the dead, and think both are Adhesion.

______________________________________

That's my conclusion. ***I think Dalinar has always heard souls from the Spiritual Realm because of Adhesion. And I think he could also listen to the souls of dead spren if he realised his powers. And that how dead spren's souls will be revived.*** 

It'll probably happen how other theories have discussed it, Dalinar's Adhesion combining with someone's Progression (similar to him combining powers with Shallan before). But that's for another theory.

565,"I'm copying down my favorite Stormlight Archive quotes in my commonplace book in a handwriting that matches each of the characters - Shallan's handwriting I know from the Illustrations, and I chose styles for Kaladin and Dalinar based on their personalities, but I can't decide what Jasnah's handwriting looks like. It won't be too showy or elegant. It would be practical, because she's a scholar who makes a lot of notes, but I doubt she'll be terribly untidy.It would also have sharp strokes, as the Alethi women's script is described.",Stormlight_Archive,What do you think Jasnah's handwriting would look like?
568,"Early in TWoK, I actually thought that spren were the spirits of people, and that Syl was the spirit of Tien.  I thought this because there is a flashback of Tien bringing Kaladin rocks because Tien finds them interesting. Then, in present day, Syl brings leaves (albeit blackbane) to Kaladin because she thought he found them interesting.  I thought that was foreshadowing, and that there was a connection between the two interactions, but it turned out to be nothing. She brought him those leaves because he had kept them on the slave wagon...not because she was Tien.

Another theory of mine I actually made a post to this sub about...  [I thought that Shallan was seeing a vision of Hemalurgy...which I now see was a stretch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/clechj/reading_wor_at_chapter_30_and_now_im_scared/)",Stormlight_Archive,"When reading the series for the first time, what is a theory you had that is now ridiculous in hindsight?"
570,"So, the first thing to mention are the groups Brandon talked about. Three groups that consist of 5, 2 and 2 characters, but you can check out that more in his updates. I believe that Kaladin will be in group 1, along with Lirin, Venli and members of Bridge 4.

But, this theory is not really about that. Anyway, let’s get to it:

What if Shallan (or really any other artist) started to draw the Radiants and soldiers as they worked. In the 1 year gap, those drawings started to be copied so that people can buy them as posters. Early on in the book, we come to know that Kaladin’s poster is the most popular to buy and he’s got a bunch of fans, mostly teenagers. At first, it’s endearing and funny. Bridge 4 members are teasing him about it and Kaladin is, in his true nature, kinda uncomfortable with his new fame and doesn’t really like it.

Later on in the book, his group has to hide/ stay low or pretend to be someone else. Let’s say they’re near a big city and they stumble upon a guard or a villager. Kaladin, as the leader, tries to get them out of the situation and introduces the group as ‘just people trying to get on the road’. But then the other person goes “No. No, I’ve seen you before. You’re the Windrunner from that poster.” They get busted and there’s some drama and so what sounded cool at first is actually what got them in trouble. 

I... don’t really know where to go from here. This wasn’t a special theory of course, more of a headcanon/ theory. I just to get it out there.",Stormlight_Archive,Theory!

any mention of a storm and i know shit is about to go down haha. i'm excited to see what old Nav and Dal have to say. yeah i don't think the nickname will stick either haha. sounds like a cheesy bbc sitcom thats cancelled after one season.

Well i am totally clueless about what is going on in this epigraph. dunno who Avena is. is the discovery something to do with voidbringers? maybe a hint of the recreance here? the radiants adherants, are they spren or what? Idk. i've really been stumped by this one.

well if Navani is believing Jasnah is dead, then that makes it more likely i think. just something niggles me. we saw her stabbed, but not dead. and could it have been an illusion of her. maybe, and this is stretching things here, but maybe she soulcast a version of herself! i guess i just don't want Navani to be dead!

Navani's reaction here is i think really well done. her entire world has collapsed, and shes in disbelief. a very realistic depiction.

OH NO!! Don't get drawn in by that Player Shallan!

As much as I think they would accept Shallan as a Radiant, same as with Kal, i think that's the right decision. Times of grief and shock aren't the right place to reveal such information. I hope they all realise it soon though. wouldn't it be funny if they were all like ' hang on, you're a radiant too?!'

Dalinar is such a calming voice of reason here. i can't even imagine the man being a hotheaded dishonourable warrior as he was. 

Oh dear. Shallan is gonna have to brush up on her flirting skills haha. funny how awkward she is. 

Eek. that is not a good look from Dalinar. i get he's trying to protect Adolin, but hes definitely playing the overprotective Dad haha. I understand why he's doing it, but he's gonna kick himsef later for not listening to Shallan. But it might give her access to more info on the voidbringers from archives maybe? although Dalinar's eyes will be on her.

Idk what it is about that name, but i really like Sebarial. Kinda rollls off the tongue. 

Shallan is extremely perceptive. i wonder if this is to do with the fact shes bonded to a liespren so she can tell maybe when certain things are going down. and everyone knows dalinar is the true king right now. and they're all lining up to stab him in the back.

i like the poltical dissection we get from Shallan here. Again being very pereceptive of everything going on. and i think sanderson has lined things up perfectly here. the battle lines are clearly drawn. its like game of thrones without all the gritty realism. i didn't enjoy WoA as much because it had too much drawn out politics. this i enjoy though.

Aladar has made his decision clear. will he be Sadeas' champion maybe. the final fight for Adolin before everything goes bat shit and Dalinar and Sadeas face off?

The tension is just oozing here between them all. its undelrying though. everyone knows this is just a theatre because nearly all of them seem to have chosen a side in this war. good riddance hopefully to Sadeas and his faction, although i suspect it'll be all out war by the end of the book. i don't see it going any other way. 

this whole thing just seems like a staring match for dalinar and sadeas. moving their chesspieces slyly, trying to grab the remaining few. dalinar wants to unit the country but i suspect hes pulling it apart further. of course i wouldn't know how to otherwise unite them all but i can still see whats happening here.

Sebarial is a curious man. i'd like to know more. he doesn't fit in here. so why is that?

oh boy. i hope shallan doesn't crumble. and they seek to blame it all on parshendi. little do they know who really pulls Szeth's strings. a king with the manipulative power of Gods. slowly playing his own twisted game with the whole of Roshar. i hope we learn more of what he's truly up to, along with the other secret societies hiding away.

Oooh hello lightweaving again. i wonder when we'll see her powers fully manifest. 

omd they just pounce on her. cus all they care about is one upping the other factions and tbh some of them probably would want more with Shallan. disgusting people. you could never get honour from these men.

my god. Sebarial's reaction is priceless. what on earth is she doing?  Ishe trying to get better terms from Dalinar in a weird manipulative way?

lol. dalinar just totally fired shots at Sebarial and he didn't even seem to care it was so brazen.

Sebarial is definitley a most curious man. hes not part of the system, yet he still is curious for info. whats going on there i wonder. seems like shallan's skills are coming in handy too to just make up lies on the spot. 

so there are eleven names for damnation? why?!

well. dalinar just dropped a bomb aha. no ones gonna agree to peace with parshendi surely. hes just gone and convinced them even more of his maddness.

&amp;#x200B;

39

a flashback again. and its getting closer in the years. hard not ti imagine shallan as a little girl but this is only 4 yrs ago!

well this is one of those incredibly awkward dinners. its like her father wants to control everything, even the guests. and he wasn't always like this, i wonder if there is some connection to being controlled by Odium or similar.

 well well well, balat is on the pull. get in there Lad.

hmm. something clearly went wrong because we never meet this new wife.

Ooh. a halfbreed. thats very interesting. must be even more an outcast than the darkeyes.

i wonder if its due to her connection with pattern that she could hear so well. it certainly seems a little unsual she could hear that much. 

yes i agree Balat. that was a horrific joke attempt!

seems like this is where Shallan's wit comes from. she's realised it can lighten the mood and so she learns to use humour as a deflection from reality. not healthy. 

seems like shallan is getting closer to remembering the truth. its clear to me her father never did it. she did. shes just put if out of her memory due to trauma. 

its a sad reality that people in an abusive house are scared to speak. well portrayed Sanderson.

&amp;#x200B;

40

 well this appears to be a continuation of the last epigraph. and so what it reveales about the recreance was that it was done in haste, and out of worry. whatever it was, either betrayal inside the knights radiant, or out, it scared them. we know the spren believe the knights betrayed them but they believe in lots of betrayal haha. were the knights responding to something between the spren and the parshendi? something dangerous like storm form or some other thing that courted Odium and so they gave up their powers in fear of the spren doing similar to them, which 'killed' the spren by sending them back to non sentience in Shadesmar?

i hope Navani listens to Shallan when the time comes. I need to learn more!!

Oh sure. she just needs to save the world. easy peasy!

Definitely improving in her lightweaving. i wonder when she'll be able to fully disguise herself. could come in handy to sneak around to get information!

very clever indeed. There is more to this Sebarial than meets the eye. I like him so far. 

Palona. Named the chapter after her. maybe she'll be important, maybe not. I wonder if she is one of Lopen's cousins hahaha.

i like the kind of comedy between these two. like an old married couple haha. This Palona is nice. i think that Shallan is in a good place right now, and i'm glad for it.",Stormlight_Archive,WoR readthrough 38 to 40
593,"While rereading I found something weird... Initially, humans speculate that parshendi need gemhearts the same way that they do, to get food. Hence, they would have their own soulcasters.

However, after Eshonai tells Adolin that they would ""not keep playing their game, let them keep their gemhearts"", that was like a month before the everstorm...

600,"So Brandon in a recent [WoB](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/415-the-dusty-wheel-interview/) said that although RoW is Venli and Eshonai's book, the ""main"" character of the book (the one getting more chapters and focus) is someone with no flashbacks (so no Venli, Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar or Szeth) and that this character is the one he enjoyed writing more.

601,"Do you ever think about how good Adolin is?

He loves his brother with all his heart, he doubted his father’s sanity but still supported him and defended him and ultimately decided to believe him. I'm surprised by the amount of people who didn't like Adolin in TWOK and even more surprised by some comments I've seen of people who thought that Adolin wanted to take over Dalinar's position when it was very clear that he didn't.

He stopped being antagonistic towards Kaladin the moment he realized just how much Kaladin is on their side, he was the first lighteyes to believe Kaladin and support him. A lot of his mistrust of Kaladin had to do with him noticing that Kaladin was *different* and not knowing if he could be trusted and given that he was right about Sadeas, I don't blame him.

He is loyal to Shallan and was willing to sacrifice his happiness with her because he thought Shallan wanted someone else. I was rooting for Adolin and I'm glad this love triangle was resolved. Though honestly I read a lot of YA and I promise you, this was barely a love triangle.

He talks to his shardblade and thanks it, he continues to honour his mother, he developed a friendship with bridge 4, and he might just be the first person to ever revive a dead spren just from Maya noticing how he behaves and treats others. 

He has grown up privileged and spoiled (though also with a lot of responsibility and unaddressed trauma) and still came out with such a beautiful soul.

TL;DR: Adolin Kholin is my favourite character.

Also I will just say that if for some reason Adolin becomes a bad guy (i.e: Odium's Champion) I'm just gonna have to switch sides lol",Stormlight_Archive,I'm here to spread Adolin Kholin propaganda (and discuss him too I guess)

I'm doing my re read currently, and just got to the first set of interludes in The Way of Kings. Ishikk is thinking about highstorms, and I noticed a line (about halfway down page 168) that says, ""The Purelake drained into pits and holes when the storms came, ...""

In it he says that ROW will be mostly about a character that doesn't get a flashback book, the flashbacks will be mostly Eshonia and Venli but the main story will follow said character mostly. Soooooo who is it? Who who who who. I think its either Adolin or Moash but im leaning more towards Adolin cause Brandon said the character is one of his favorite and Moash sucks.

617,"ch 41

what is this act of great villainy? is this one of the acts of betrayal talked about?

has there potentially been an order still kept going this entire time? is that why szeth has windrunner powers perhaps?

Good to be back with Kal again, the fast pace seems to switch viewpoints more often which is great. not left waiting for the next chapters with a specific character and i appreciate that.

Yeah what is up with Teft. Is he meeting with some shady people or something? that just doesn't ring true. i'll have to keep a beady eye on that one. i don't think he could be Sadeas' spy but maybe its blackmail.

it is still quite inspiring to see the transformation of the men. if Dalinar truly knew of Ka's ability to work such wonders, he'd definitely put him in charge of shaping up the highprinces. Although i don't like Kal's sense of entitlement here. his character is changing slightly and Syl is noticing. I suspect he might make a mistake by killing amaram or something and the bond will break because he isn't keeping to his oaths of honour.

Kal, you feel anxious because you put the pressure on yourself. you feel a responsibility to the men that not many people could bear. i think he's racing towards a battle within himself and hes going to have to choose between the person he's become and the person he needs to be for Roshar. because he is honourable but he still has prejudice and trust issues. understandably so, yet it is making things rough with Syl. also, a lot has gone on in only one day haha. sometimes it jumps so quick and sometimes the book spends a while on a few days. 

glad syl is kinda confronting Kal. he needs to know what he wants, what his purpose is. because atm he just kinda seems keen on vengance against lighteyes and szeth. that not honour. thats not keeping to the oaths. he needs to have an aim to drive him, but one that fulfills the oaths.

FINALLY! someone starts asking proper questions around here. the Parshendi must've known of the rest of Roshar to be able to seek out Szeth. and we knoew why Szeth was made truthless now, but where he got the blade from is still up in the air. 

storms, i love rock and lopen so much. the GA interpretation of Lopen is hillarious. i wonder why Herdazians don't stay in Herdaz much.

&amp;#x200B;

hmm. before Syl was saying he wasn't a windrunner, now she's unsure. is she losing memory? and acting more childish too. its funny, but it seems she might be reverting back to early WoK state. not good.

so the nightwatcher is a spren huh. i'd like to learn more of the old magic and stuff. not much been spoken of yet.

a good reminder of Sigzil and his relationship to Hoid. i wonder if that gets explored further. and if we will see Sigzil elsewhere in later cosmere books? and people dancing on clouds? whats all that about?!

surges that rule the universe? hmm, so the entire cosmere is run off of investiture? is that a thing? i knew magic was important, but not by that much. i don't like the way kaladin is talking of this primal force. power can corrupt. i suspect he'll use it dishonourably on a lighteyes. as revenge. and that'll break the bond. i hope i'm wrong.

Omg. is he seeing Shadesmar?

cool, Kaladin has now done all three lashings. he's progressing well.

can Kaladin really not see that his scars won't heal, because he perceives himself as too broken to be put back together? this is an important moment for him though. Syl kinda forced him to admit what he wants. and he wants Dalinar to be a good man, but he can't trust yet. good though he'll give him the knights radiant. i hope it all works out. funny as well that he doesn't know honor is dead. i wonder when he'll find that one out. Also noticed that he couldn't grab Syl. i've noticed before a few offhanded sentences about spren interaction with the world. pattern seems to grow more solid, whilst syl less.

knew it. he still plans to kill amaram. i don't think its a coincidence his stormglight started to run out when he said that and Syl warned him.

hmm. a rope? they seem convinced but idk. it feels slightly out. 

Moash just keeps coming up doesn't he. Kaladin is putting off the inevitable confrontation. I'm convinced he did it. he hates lighteyes.

hmm. those gouges seem a hint of something. maybe a chasmfiend will kill a lot of men soon. i hope not. but kaladin has a bad feelling about it, so i'm concerned.

What in the storms is Renarin doing here?! why does he think anyone would let him be in bridge four. he cannot fight a mouse in the condition he's in now! I hope it changes and he becomes awesome but he's weak as of now, a liability in battle.

so epilepsy huh. well its harsh, but you can't risk that on the field. and those symptoms Kal is asking about sound similar to a stroke. whys he asking about a stroke i wonder.

yeah why do the ardents teach that. Has Odium overtaken the Tranquiline halls?

man, he really wants this. i guess if he's just patrolling kal could take him on. i really feel for him. it seems he feels like he's letting the side down if he doesn't participate.

Jeez he really is terrfiied. this took a lot out of him. makes sense for someone with autism. this was a huge step for him. Proud Renarin.

Ah yes, where is Vasher/Zahel? he said come back the next day for sword practice!

Moash, you just hate lighteyes. you need to grow lad! its childish.

come on Kal, you can't keep putting it off!

Well i hope we learn soon Moash. It must've been horrific. Enough for him to join an attempt at assasination.

Why can't you live it anymore? and walking away from Syl again? come on Kal!

&amp;#x200B;

So Ishi is clearly instrumental in the creation of the radiants, and founding their sturctures and rules. cool. other than that, not much else to this it seems. not sure why ishi specifically so important. maybe we'll find out one day.

Interesting the juxtaposition between Pattern and Shallan. One growing, whilst one regressing. 

Tbh idk what other metaphor i'd use haha. I thought that was quite a good description. Its a hard concept to describe.

ooh here we go. more ghostblood info. finally! Glad this plot seems to be moving a little quicker now.

i wonder if there is a way to get hold of her brothers. cus the ghostbloods are probably tracking what communication occurs. could a spanreed be hacked perhaps?

Seems Tyn was in deep. she wasn't just a hire, she was actively part of the Ghostbloods and working her way up. If Shallan can take her place, that would be amazing for information.

aha. this is one of those times Pattern comes in very handy aha.

omd shes actually properly lightweaved. she's growing and i'm so proud! I've been waiting for this moment. ngl, i'd forgotten about the whole eye drops. and this is still just a journey, Shallan still being a complete perfectionist but work on that can come.

haha, i love pattern's reactions to, well, patterns!

so these ghostbloods have connections in the camp if they know Shallan is there. I mean not suprising ,but still you'd kinda hope a shady as fuck society with sinister motives wasn't in the warcamp where your fave characters are haha.

love shallan's reaction to no glove haha. its so odd to us to imagine it, but it would've been similar customs in the uk just over a hundred years ago.

get in there shallan. have authority. take those bitches!! woo

&amp;#x200B;

43

unbelievably excited for this chapter. i love tales of subterfuge and espionage and secret societies. this is my bread and butter in a book haha. immersing myself in the world and engaging with the characters.

ok so another order is called skybreakers and were the last to be formed because Nalan was a stubborn bastard and it took riots to convince him to join. i wonder if there is any coonection between the fact that this is a chapter about a society running around in secret, and that the skybreakers are mentioned here. One order never gave up. ah, i'm probably reaching here haha but i love to theorise even if tis crazy!!

ha, Shallan and that bloody glove lol. It is incredible how poorly darkeyes are seen that she can be basically invisible. we've had it for a while now, but it still gets me. in our world at least the xenophobes don't rule the country. they just sit on their computers and get angry at modern society haha.

i love the depictions of the market here. So vibrant, and i laughed at the inclusion of a punch and judy box!

funny all the little quirks sanderson adds in to show how out of her depth Shallan is. i mean imgaine buying a toffe apple with like 250 pounds instead of 1. that'd be unthinkable here as well! better be the damned tastiest toffe apple anyway haha. 

I like imagining pattern kinda scuttling around trying to figure out all the clues of someone tailing. idk why but i imagine him like a spider scuyrring along behind Shallan.

A second lightweaving is an intersting concept. i guess you'd have to be at a pretty high oath level for that. I wonder if Shallan will get there one day.

haha i can totally imagine Shallan like a Rosharan Jonny English, ineptly infiltrating a criminal gang of masterminds by pure luck and chance haha. muddle through indeed.

deflecting to humour again. not a great habit of hers. a coping mechanism that doesn't solve the root of the issues. ah well. 

second breakfast!! hehe

could this be part of the remains of Urithiru? unlikely but perhaps.

hmm. who is this odd messenger Shallan keeps remembering. an engima who knows so much, a worldhopper? if her father is involved with secret organsiations someone might've been a worldhopper in it.

violet eyes that look like glass. unusual. didn't the soulcasters with Navani have similar eyes?

i don't like how suspciious he is. i get it but it worries me for Shallan.

this man seems very quick to switch alliegences. as soon as Tyn misses once he wants her gone. he don't fuck with anybody this dude.

this woman creeps me out. that mask seems kinda like parshendi skin but i know it isn't. i guess maybe its a hint to the mask wearing cliche of secret societies. but its growing into the skin, so a part of her people. i don't think we've met any else yet. i'll have to keep an eye out for similar in the rest of the cosmere from now on hehe. its the kind of hint brandon woul give for a woldhopper.

this man uses a lot of hunting metaphors. a man of thought, juxtaposing with the brutality and quick thinking of hunting. at least Shallan is still alive!

why do i get the sense this guy is like the collector from the Marvel movies haha. This stuff is what i love because its cosmere baiting. I love to see the hints of the extended universe. i'm assumin the sand is from white sand so Taldain, but i havent' read yet so cannot confirm. golden hair is the royal locks im thinking, and the flower is the tears of edgli maybe? or a flower from Scadrial. Silver knife i'm thinking is from Threnody. so either himself or someone else in the organisation has been to everywhere except Sel, and Yolen, and wherever sixth of the dusk is set. not sure what the hairpins and tree is for. hairpins could be spikes from scadrial at a stretch? dunno what the pink stuff is. soulstone is white with red so can't be that. idk but i know i love to see these easter eggs! now i wanna know more of where they came from.

i wonder where they got that fabrial from. perhaps they took ideas from their worldhopping?

Mraize huh. interesting name. Sounds kinda blunt, fits with the character haha. Its not Vorin, yet he hasn't been mentioned as very odd so i suspect he is from elsewhere on Roshar. 

That bloody Amaram. what kind of foolishness is he into now. being dragged into ghostblood attention means he knows something of Urithiru or the voidbringers i suspect. 

his life belongs to another? who is protecting him? or is it someone else has a claim on him to kill him. wouldn't suprise me.

Shallan, take it one step at a time! You fooled Mraize so far. the rest will come. Now focus on shaking that tail!

I love how Pattern doesn't realise they aren't friends haha. growing in understanding but oh so naive still.

I wonder why it only works if she draws. is her imagination not powerful enough yet to perceive herself? or something else? i'm convinced her artistic ability and memory is linked to the bond with Pattern but how it works with lightweaving idk. hopefully we figure it out more as we go along. 

Clever of Shallan to put up that wall. I dunno if i would be that quick thinking. and learning quickly too. she couldn't lightweave properly the day before and now she can hold decent illusions. I'd like to learn more of the masked woman. very mysterious. tense scene though, i enjoyed it. could definitely visualise it in my mind's eye.

haha, Shallan has got the thrill of the chase. I hope it means more snooping and chasing cus boy is it fun.",Stormlight_Archive,WoR vh 41 to 43 readthrough
618,"Very informal introduction and random questions...


I just finished reading the first 3 Stormlight Archives books and the Edgedancer novella. However, I must confess that by “reading” I mean listening to the audiobooks. So please go easy on me as I will undoubtedly butcher each and every name as a result. 


While I have a lot of ideas and theories about characters in the story itself, I am not familiar with the greater cosmere universe. I joined this group yesterday to broaden my perspective on the subject and this is my first official post. I will definitely be diving into more books in the future as time allots.


Now, the reason I am posting is because I have an idea that the “dark home” from ancient singer songs might have something to do with “the girl who looked up” and the light she stole might have been a spren, like Timbre. I haven’t seen anything else in the sub about this but like I said I am new and still looking around. The other idea I had was that the dark city might be shadesmar. If this is the case, I haven’t had time to actually wrap my mind around it yet. If you know of any great posts along this line I would absolutely appreciate if you could point me in the right direction.


Also, does anyone have any more ideas about the lighting city or the city of shadows that we hear about in edgedancer? And do you think the vision Dalinar sees of the assassin killing the king in the high tower might be related? I can’t easily find these sections in my audiobooks and have started my first re-read with the hopes of paying more attention now that I know what I am looking for. That usually seems to work best for me.


Anyways, I really just wanted an excuse to introduce myself to everyone in the group and to say that I enjoyed this series much more than I had originally expected. Thanks Brandon!",Stormlight_Archive,"Dark home, the girl who looked up, and Timbre (spoilers)"
623,"I just finished Oathbringer and I am in post book depression so I thought I’d go back and read TWoK and WoR. I noticed a couple of things after going back to reread TWoK.

-When we see Szeth walking through the hallway he passes statues of the Heralds but notices that the statue of Shalash is missing, this is alluding to the fact that she goes around destroying any representation of herself.

-When he passes the separate room for the beggars that get to feast, he notices a man with a beard in the doorway who he thinks is crazy.

So what determines the type of surgebinder you become (Ie Kaladin is a windrunner and Shallan is illusions [i forget whats its called])? Is it the person or the type of spren? Or is it just random?

Also, who can bond to a spren? Is it a predestined type of thing, where everyone who could bond with a spren is already determined before them or the spren exist, or is it like certain people have the potential to bond but may or may not ever bond with one? Or could anyone willing to swear the oath go out and have a reasonable chance of finding a spren that will bond with them?",Stormlight_Archive,"Questions about Spren, No oathbringer spoilers please"
630,"Ok, hang in there with me. 

In chapter 13 of TWoK, during the great shell hunt, Adolin makes some comments that had me thinking about shardplate. My theory of what shardplate is made of, is dead spren, but lesser spren than those that make bonds (Honor spren&gt;wind spren) I have a couple places in WoR and Oathbringer that made me think this.   
Anyway, during the hunt, Adolin is discussing the Blackthorn running to save Ehlokar from the chasmfiend. He says ""Dalinar charged toward the kin, moving with a speed and grace no man--**not even one wering shardplate--**should be able to manage"" (Hardback edition, p 209). Anyway, I always thought Dalinar is just tou much of a BAMF to be normal. 

However, later Adolin describes his father while holding the claw, as a""figure in dark, silvery metal that almost seemed to glow"" (ibid). 

With these two moments, and my thoughts about shardplate being dead lesser spren, and Dalinar going to Ehlokar as a desperate attempt to live up to an oath to protect his nephew, I think that Dalinar actually brought his shardplate a little life back, like Adolin did with Maya when she spoke to him.

My apologies if this isn't an acceptable post. Doesn't seem to break any rules, though. The blog relates to The Stormlight Archive and Dalinar specifically. I just know this ideology can be a politically charged topic but I really wanted to share. It made my jaw drop in disbelief.

Personally, I’ve always seen Dalinar as an upstanding example of what it is to be a good man. Engaging in war doesn’t make a man toxic. It can lead to unfortunate circumstances and tough decisions that weigh heavily on one's soul. So sure, Dalinar has his bleak and bloody past. However, I don’t like the comparison being made here of how he overcame Toxic Masculinity. I don't agree with the label in general.

636,"I'm on my, maybe, 4th? listen-through of the 3 current books \[yes, I'm one of those audiobook people (all hail Michael and Kate), so please forgive anything I misspell lol\], and I just reached the part in WoR where Kaladin talks to the Stormfather just before Szeth's first attempt at killing Dalinar. The Stormfather tells Kaladin that he's already started killing Syl by breaking his oaths. It occurred to me that the only time they talk about Radiants' oaths being broken is when they talk about the recreance. But surely there had to been people that broke their oaths, and killed their spren, even before the recreance? 

&amp;#x200B;

The orders at the time of the recreance were quiet large since, if I recall correctly, in Dalinar's vision of the recreance there were over 300 Knights and those were just Windrunners and Stonewards. That's just counting ones that had reached, at least, the 4th ideal. Who knows just how many initiates there were under the 1st through 3rd ideals. If I recall correctly in Oathbringer, Urithiru is described as being utterly massive and the home to thousands of members of each order (except Bondsmiths, of course). I find it hard to believe with that many people that there weren't the occasional person that broke their oaths. Has this been addressed? I know it is addressed, sorta, in WoR with Kaladin and Syl. But they just keep pointing to the recreance. And I'd like to think that it's purely because Kaladin doesn't understand the nature of the bond is why he fails/unfails. In the time before the recreance they do understand the bond, so I'd imagine the bond wasn't broken very often. Is there something I'm missing?",Stormlight_Archive,Broken Oaths?
637,"Stormfather this is getting good! This is my first run through the series. I’m about 2/3 through Words of Radiance right now. I’m listening to it on audiobook, mostly to and from work at the hospital. Helps distract me from the craziness right now. I just got to Adolin’s surprise 4 on 1 duel and got to work just as Kaladin jumped into the arena. I was yelling at my speakers while Adolin was getting man handled by these guys and cheered, probably looking like a mad man in the parking garage, when Kaladin swooped in. 

When I finally finished work today I couldn’t turn the audiobook off. I nearly lost it when the chapter switched to Shallan’s POV I needed to know the action first hand and so far I’ve groaned nearly every time it switches to Shallan. I actually liked her a lot in WoK (which I read instead of listened to) and don’t know if it’s the narrator or her character arc that has just really slowed me through this book. But storms was I thrilled to hear it change to Kaladin as he took on the the shardbearers. Had to finally turn it off when he challenged Amaran to a duel. Shame the king wants to arrest him... 

I’m really hoping this energy keeps up. I’ve been really slow through this book compared to WoK despite having it on audiobook. Now it really feels like things are getting somewhere! Other than assuming Kaladin finds a way out of being arrested and Sadeas weasels his way out of the duel (maybe because of Kaladin’s accusations against Amaran?)

These characters have yet to interact but I could see the paring being viable. Both are very strong willed characters(but honestly who isn’t strong willed in this book), both characters are advocates or at least have a desire to save/protect the singers(awakened parshmen). Both Kal and Venli have a different opinion on listeners and humans then the rest of there people, Kal views people in a way where I think he could end up with a parshwoman, even if they are different species. It would also create a really great moral conflict for the characters(not just Kal and Venli but everyone really). It works wonderfully with both characters and there conflicted dynamics that they have(meaning the characters are conflicted with themselves not each other). Of course there is Rlain, who worries he’s the last of his kind(original singer) and Venli who also worries the same thing. At some point I think Venli is gonna switch over to the side of the humans and they will discover eachother. Which is also a potential pairing for Venli. Of course it could just be that Kal won’t find someone and that he’s strong on his own and doesn’t need a partner(personally I don’t want that cuz I don’t think it’s good for him, he needs other people).

665,"After rereading the series many times, I have a strong feeling that Jasnah was abused as a child. I think that her entire self-image which projects confidence, logic and strength is to ensure that she is never vulnerable to anyone, even slightly. Her reluctance to develop a proper emotional relationship with anyone outside her family and pen pals feels like distrust. I also think that it was done by someone close to her, like a family member. One particular instance in her POV chapter in OB made this feeling strong in me. Unfortunately I don’t remember what it was exactly. 

I’d hate to see Gavilar being that person. Although we haven’t seen her remember him with any affection yet. But she respects Dalinar so much, even though now we know how he was before Gavilar’s death. I haven’t seen any evidence of their relationship, to understand her feeling that Dalinar is the best man on the planet.

Brandon has mostly stayed away from topics like these in his books, only alluding to them in the early chapters of The Final Empire. Hence I’m not sure if this is what happened.

Where else have we seen a flute? Wit gave a flute to Kaladin and later, when Wit asked him if he still had it, Kaladin admitted he had lost it. Could be unrelated, but that sounds like more than a flute to me.

It is better then I remember and the pacing was vastly improved but there are still major concerns I have with it.  What are your thoughts? 

1. The big reveal that humans were the original invaders. I understand that there are major in world religious issues but as the Stormfather says. Who cares what your ancestors did 6000+ years ago. When genocide/enslavement of your species is at your door now. Bridge 4 abandons the city over this!  

2. While personal improvement is all over the place in reality the constant backsliding of the characters with issues they had break throughs within previous books is annoying.  It makes for bad reading IMHO. Shallan is an example of this. 

3. Kaladin’s actions in the Capitol. While I understand Kaladin’s inner conflict, he let the king die and I find that hard to forgive. 

4. What was not shown. This was my real concern with the book itself. There were a lot scenes that should have been shown but weren’t. Dalinar’s interaction with Szeth. The wedding. What Jasnah learned on her journey and others. Major scenes that had personal resolutions/conflict and information.

712,"I'm an avid dnd player and I've been planning a Knight Radiant homebrew, but I can't decide on how I should handle it. I'm stuck on choosing whether or not it should be a full class homebrew, or a subclass.

I'm leaning towards a subclass since that would be easier, but then I can't decide on which class it should be under. Fighter would fit the use of shardblades, monk would work best for storm light abilities, but paladin/warlock would be the most thematically appropriate.

To explain to non-dnd players:

Fighters are your standard fantasy knight/warrior that lacks magic. Think Gimli or Boromir from LOTR

Monks are your Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon king fu masters, but have a mechanic where they have ki points that they expend for abilities that would easily convert to stormlight

Paladins are holy warriors who are given power by a god in exchange for their loyalty to said god. Most thematic to the ""oaths to protect etc"" knights radiant make

Warlocks are similar to paladins, but are more magic focused and rather having power in exchange for loyalty, they form a pact with a supernatural being of power (not necessarily a god) called a Patron, where they must obey their patron in exchange for powers. Most thematic to the actual relationship between a knight and their spren.

Right now I'm leaning closest toward paladin, and making it use their spell slots (in dnd magic user have their spells limited by spells and slots of different levels. In order to cast a spell a caster must expend a slot of equal or higher than the spells level. Some class abilities uses spell slots for things other than spells.) to fuel the windrunner/lightweaver powers.

If I made a full class, I'd be able to get it much closer to a proper knight radiant but it'd be much harder to balance.

Is it possible that the 10 Alethi Highprince Specializations(of which we only know four, war, commerce, information, and works) are related to the functions of the 10 silver kingdoms?

When we first see one of Dalinar’s visions, he talks to a female Radiant(TWoK, pg. 306). She mentions that the Radiants live in Alethela, and that it studies the arts of war

&gt;Urithiru is where our orders are centered, but we live in cities all across Alethela. 
&gt;”One kingdom to study the arts of war so that the others may have peace”

As is repeatedly mentioned, the modern-day Alethi are known for their warlike tendencies(war)

Alethela(now Alethkar)’s people are known for their warlike tendencies(war)

Thalath-many merchants and shop keeps are Thaylen, and Thaylenah is known for its trading(commerce)

I’m unsure about what Silver Kingdoms would fit into the roles of information and works(possible Makabakam for information?) but at least two seem to fit the Alethi Highprince specializations. 

Due to the limited amount of information about both the Silver Kingdoms and the different Alethi Highprince Specializations, most of this is just speculation. Still, there is some possible evidence for it.

Way of Kings: The whole fight at the tower was just incredible, and Sadeas betrayal made me so angry. Seeing all the plots sort of come together at the end was remarkably satisfying. I also loved the ending of Shallan's story in the Way of Kings. 

Words of Radiance: The duel when Kaladin joins in the duel with Renarin and Adolin. Kaladin is such a badass. Adolin killing Sadeas was another amazing moment. Words of Radiance was my favorite in the series. I was in school and I had to use it as a reward system. I would think to myself ""okay, do your homework and you get to read the next chapter"" and I would use any freetime to read a chapter.

Oathbringer: ""you cannot have my pain"", an incredibly cathartic moment that sort of caps the end of Dalinars amazing arc throughout Oathbringer. While I think Oathbringer has its issues, I think they are outweighed by moments like these.

I have read ALL of The Mistborn books and absolutely loved them. They were fantastic and kept me interested all the way up to the very end. I also read The Way of Kings way back when it first released and loved it also. Needless to say, I'm aware of the cosmere and how it works.

That being said, I have sort of a weird question and I'm not entirely sure anyone can help me. Since finishing The Way of Kings (which has been probably 7-8 years now I think, maybe longer) I have not kept up with the rest of the books in the series because I heard he was supposed to be releasing 10 books total for The Stormlight Archives.

All of that leads up to my predicament. I REALLY want to read The Way of Kings over again and the two following that one and by then I'm sure it'll be time for the 4th book to be released. My issue is that once I have all 4 books read, I highly doubt I'll remember everything for the 5th book and the rest of the series.

Gloryspren suggests he likes the feeling of power that comes with a shardblade. perhaps too much. but at least it shows he didn't use the blade. He was too inept here. however that doesn't mean he wasn't involved in the attempted assasination.

hehe. Zahel has a lot of sword eperience, and i guess Nightblood has completely changed his perceptions on them. I can understand why he doesn't see them as holy.

oof here we go. Kaladin gonna look like a fool probably and then Adolin will laugh.

This is a very cinematic scene and i love it, espeically with the abrupt ending when he turns to Adolin. I can totally see this in a film or tv show. I'm suprised Adolin didn't mock but i appreciate it and understand the reasoning. Perhaps Szeth has shocked him into growing up!

Better get used to a woman with a sword Kal cus Shallan has a blade and i bet you're gonna be fighting alongside her in the near future. Maybe by book Four haha. 

It's an interesting insight into the way Kaladin's mind works here. he refuses to touch a blade, and i hope he gets over that, but we see his method and motivation for remmebering the stances. He's always working to improve himself, and I admire that. 

I wonder if there is a reason those soldiers are named but the other three looking after Renarin aren't.

Time for Shallan and Kaladin to meet properly for the first time I hope.

 Yake my friend, you are right. Kaladin is far too serious for his own good! Shallan needs humour less as a defence and Kaladin needs it more as a respite! Opposites do attract they say haha.

I'm still wondering what the hell was up with Teft dissapearing but whatever. I'm sure we'll find out and I don't have any clues yet.

Adolin and Kal's banter is hillarious. I love it. Adolin's reaction when he realises she isn't here for him is priceless. I knew the man was self centred but really? and then he can't believe its not true. too funny. 

I wonder if Shallan sketching the King's plate will make Kaladin suspicious of her. Thinking she might be sketching it to check for weaknesses. 

Shallan totally just played them both haha. i like her wit. I know the fans find it annoying, but personally i think its quite humerous. 

Honestly, how is this man child surviving. Now she's hard to get he wants her. Crazy dude.

I knew it! He admits involvement. such a terrible story from Moash and I can understand the need, same as Kaladin feels the need to fight Amaram. But it doesn't justify it. They can get their justice when Dalinar rules. I'm curious who he wants Kaladin to meet though. Someone important, and dangerous. and what is the phrase Nalan's hands about?! Thats the true mystery of this chapter haha.

Omg, whats wrong with Syl?!

Ok so something dark is going on. More than Kaladin ha been told, and perhaps more than Moash knows. Is he being influenced by Odium? It is hate that Moash has for Elhokar after all. Perhaps its opened him up to something darker. Last time Syl reacted like this was in the storm, warning of Odium's coming. or at least thats what i took from that chapter anyway.

Again, impressive how Sanderson can pick the flaws of religion and portray them well despite being heavily religous. As someone religous, it refreshing not to get propoganda from the man. Too often Rightwing christians are heavy handed and i don't like how it reflects on liberals like myself. Anwyay, back to the book ahha. This man has an almost supernatural gift at being able to write from different perspectives.

Kaladin is right, there is hypocrisy. But by not becoming like them, we do the honourable thing. Don't let yourself stoop to their level Kal.

Interesting discussion with Syl here. Confirming that Parshendi cannot be surgebinders although we already knew that from hints in the epigraphs, and that the desire to kill Amaram is changing Kal. Hopefully he'll listen to Syl before its too late.

I wonder if Kal ever will perform a last clap. Would be cool.

Another flashback! I'm glad we're getting more of these now. and a more substantial one as well. A good start.

Hehe. Thaylens and their chickens. and Shallan getting so scared haha. What are the Unmade though? they've been referenced before, they seem like Gods. Perhaps the Parshendi ones?

Wow so her father is racist as well. Fabulous. Hardly suprising but still, doesn't make him any more endearing. I know that isn't the idea though! I wish we had some characters that were a bit grey. I know it's not Sanderson's thing,  but it would be nice to complement the albeit very well written cliches haha.

oh my goodness she had a stepmother?! i dont know if i wanna know what happened to her!

Well Lin is really being taken for a ride here. Shallan's father has destroyed nearly everything they ever worked for. Now all he gets is used.

Ooh worldsingers. I wonder if Sigzil was here.

What work does Shallan have? this has made me curious now.

its sad how much Shallan talks about wanting true freedom. Really adds to the melancholy. 

What trouble is she getting into with this lighteyed girl now?

Even at a young age it appears Shallan had a keen skill in manipulating to get what she wanted. Useful skill for her now haha. Very clever child. I feel sorry for the man haha.

oh no, they show their fingertips, how vile hehe.

Hmm i wonder why Spren don't appear when there are so many emotions in close range. maybe thats something to put in my mind for later.

Balat is one creepy motherfucker. I'm worried about this obsession he seems to have with animal killing and fighting. Its so serial killer esque. What's it all leading towards?

Aha, so Shallan's work is match maker. hehe, cheeky girl. He better not kill Eylita. 

So they know what he does? and don't stop him. Boy he's fucked up. and he set those fires too iirc. maybe his mother's death has driven him to murder tendencies.

hmm. who is Jushu meeting with?

This is the messenger she confused Mraize for! I remember the jet back hair. Is that a vial of metals he's ingesting? What will he use it for i wonder? I didn't seen any signs of use in the few seconds after he took it. So we have a worldhopper here potentially. and it isn't Mraize. Who we still don't know the nationality of. Hopefully we get more clues to that and this messenger.

Wow, that's a big step. Clearly whatever was said hurt her Father. This messenger must appear again since why would Shallan remember him so clearly otherwise? 

A rare moment of self awareness from Lin. Did that potential allomancer soothe his emotions or something? Is that why he slumped?

&amp;#x200B;

What's Jushu doing to destory himself? Alcohol, drugs? Balat is creepy as fuck and i agree he's turning the same way, Malise is trapped in abuse. What an awful family life

  to save Wikim? Was he going to commit suicide?

Funny him talking about the Almighty not talking when we know he's dead haha.For them the clues are there, but they never see it. I wonder if they ever will.

Ok Wikim, no need to be a dick.

Well well well. The messenger is Mr Hoid himself. I wonder what will happen if Shallan meets him again on the plains as Wit. I guess he'll look different. Is he affecting Shallan's emotions here? Is that why he took the metals in? He must have used the bead of Lerasium he has if he's a mistborn now. Why is he suprised Shallan is here i wonder and why did his uprbringing make him ineffective aty being a threat? I look forward to the book about Hoid's past when we get it. Shallan must be important if he is following her.

So Hoid knows she is a radiant. and that box shows up again. What does it mean her mother's soul I wonder.

aha. story time with uncle Hoid! Love it. Another reference to this God Beyond. Surely he isn't gonna bring it up just to never follow through!

I gotta admit i didn't make any notes aha. i had to just read through to the end. It was so beautifully written. I love the philosophical scenes and scenes of Hoid. Really gets you thinking. I think Shallan is right, we find beauty in whatever we want to find it in. Its almost hardcoded into us. Even in the darkest moments, we always see a way out to a better place, whatever the way out is. Its each person's own perception of beauty. 

Hoid maybe rioted on her emotion there as well? Why did he want her to lightweave and find out if she was radiant? He hasn't done that with all the radiants so far. Why Shallan specifically i wonder. So the Shards are strict, which i guess means there's a lot of rules to the world and the abilities need precision. Maybe a reference to the oaths and a need to stick to them? Hoid said he didn't understand lies, well the nature of them, what changed? He is often in disguise so did he manage to become a lightweaver himself somehow? and what things does Shallan face that aren't natural? Perhaps further hint of a supernatural intervention in Shallan's family life? What people did her mother know, ghostbloods?

Either way, lots to unpick and i'm sure there will be plenty to pick up on in a reread.

Hmm. The edgedancers sound quite ominous. I look forward to the novella!

I'm glad Kaladin is accepting as they are, although i suspected no less. However I am slightly worried at how he is lying to them. Just because of the reference to commanders. He can't become like those before him.

I'm glad there's at least one problem crew haha. Not everything can be rosy, and Sanderson has a tendency to skip out on that some of the time. Poor Vet though, why would a socially awkward man be put in charge of a bridge crew! Hopefully Kaladin can work these men out. I love to see the transformations that he achieves.

Rip. Odium Spren are still coming. At least im calling them odium spren since i'm associating red with hate an anger. Also, I know people exactly like Kaladin. Won't listen to anyone telling them they need a break!

Syl's confusion at the joke is perhaps another sign in her worrying regression. I hope Kal changes before its too late.

Ah Hobber. What a bridgeman. I love to see him still soldiering on, depsite all that he's gone through. I suppose Renarin is quite odd just by virtue of being with the bridgemen, but his autism explains a lot. 

Jeez. More cousins?! Is the book of endless pages just about Herdazians and all their cousins?! Are all herdazians related or some shit like that haha?!

Wow. what a moving moment. Shen deserves this. I'm glad Kaladin has changed his mind. It was the right thing to do after Shen's service to the men. I wonder what he's about to say though, didn't sound good exactly. He sounded worried. A warning about Eshonai perhaps?

Yayyy. I do love a good drinking bonding sesh! and bridge four are some of my fave characters so this should be good.

Is this more hinting by Brandon, the reference to Azir and Jah Keved's problems? He seems to bring it up a few times that's for sure!

I do love the camaradarie and banter between the crew. Especially Lopen and Rock's comments as a whole. 

Peet you player! Never thought about married bridgemen though before. i assumed it was like the military. would be cool to meet Rock's family one daand have people live together.

Hot Springs? That's crazy the mountains are warm. I love it! I wanna see the mountains now aha.

Ooh a story with Rock! i love story info dumps!!

So there are levels of spren? interesting. i guess i could've assumed that cus not all spren are sentient.

i like the way rock tells this story. its fascinating. and the gods of the mountains are most powerful which is interesting. what spren are they i wonder and what spirits live up there?!

omg are these shardpools? they must be. they show you shadesmar. 

hehe Peet trying to impress da lady!!

so Rock knows more of the shardpools but won't say. It sounded very RAFO Brandonesque haha. But clearly there's more to it than anyone who swims in shardpool can see spren thren. i wonder if we have seen any horneater worldhoppers.

There seems to be something to that line about riverspren and windpsren. Not radiant bonded but can talk. interesting indeed. i wonder how.

Omg its only bloody Hoid! He saw Hoid come?! Is this from when he went into that shardpool in Elantris perhaps?! No wonder Sigzil looks so flushed aha. 

So Hoid is bound by something not to hurt men? curious. didn't he mention before he wasn't a good fighter. i'm sure he said something about it. 

Funny how the fights and plateau runs were a staple of book one and now are just mentioned briefly. shows how rich the world is that such a big theme becomes a lot smaller only two books in.

well if they're resorting to open acts like that, it's really not going well for Dalinar. 

Listen to your gut Kal. the gut is what got you bonded with Syl because you followed it to be honorable. Don't fall into the trap.

Oof. This chapter really is good. The last few have been great for cosmere and plot. lots of secret meetings! i like it.

Oh dear. Why has Syl dissappeared from sight? This really isn't a good sign.

I like this guy Graves. He seems quite amiable despite his dark intentions. I can understand his reasonings depsite disagreeing with his methods. On first instinct, i really like him, shady though he may be. I can see why Moash is working with him.

Ngl i didn't even know Elhokhar had a wife and child!

Oof. If they think they'll get back the blackthorn they got another thing coming! Dalinar is a new man.

I can tell this is gonna confict in Kal for a while. Like me, he agrees but not with the method. Moash isn't gonna listen, its obvious. He's gonna kill him regardless. There's gonna be a confrontation. And i suspect that Graves has more of a stake in this than he wants to show. hmm.",Stormlight_Archive,WoR 44-46 readthrough

736,"So I was chatting with my dnd buddies through discord (gotta stay safe), and mentioned how long TWoK is, one if my buds jokingly said ""I could read it in a day"", so after some back forth I tell him that if he can read both TWoK and WoR before our next game (1 week) I'd give him a magic item in our dnd game (I'm the DM).

737,"Which one is your favorite?

And your least favorite? 

So far for me:

1) Words of Radiance. I just love this book so much, everything is on the right place and has no weak moments. Shallan is incredible, and is so grateful to see Bridge 4 in a better position after so much shit they passed trough. I never saw Jasnah death coming, it was shocking. Also while I feel TWOK was a big introduction book, is this one the shit start to get serious 

2) The Way of Kings, it's a bit too complicated for starters (specially if english is not your native language) but once it ""clicks"" this book becomes awesome. Also the parts 4 and 5, HOLY SHIT. This book made me so thirsty, I'm glad to only read it after Words of Radiance came out, otherwise I would have died waiting for the next one (jokes)

3) Oathbringer. I think it's the only book with a major flaw in the narrative which is expected since it the book in the ""middle"" of the story. Part 1 and Part 2 (loved the POV of minor characters) are great, but part 3 invasion-arc is a bit too long and part 4 seems a bit out of place, specially because Szeth arc. I also had problems imagining the scenes in Shadesmar, but that's a 100% personal problem (lack of imagination maybe), not fault of the author. Part 5 though stills the best climax of this series so far, and the revelations were incredible. Never expected to see so many answer here, it was very brave and unexpected, definitely set up a good place for the last 2 books.

Perhaps the reason that Radiants feared Sja-Anat the most was because their Shardplate (composed of lesser spren) could get corrupted by her, thus leaving them vulnerable. And because Brandon knows how to use the plot to keep secrets from us, no one that went to Kholinar had Shardplate either because they haven't gotten to that point in their ideals or because it couldn't get transported by Windrunners.

I'm curious what everyone's thoughts are on why the Parshendi bothered with the treaty? 

I've read that they agreed to it because the Alethi army was more powerful than them, but that really doesn't make sense to me. They planned on openly killing their King, and had no intentions of hiding it, or trying to deceive the Alethi about it. They aren't stupid, they know this would cause the Alethi to press them with an aggressive war. 

So why bother with the treaty? They knew it would lead to war. Seems like it would have made a lot more sense to stay in the shattered plains and fortify their location, and prepare for the inevitable war their assassination would cause.

I want to discuss something that is probably going to rub some people the wrong way so keep in mind that is just my opinion and what I feel like. Excuse me if my grammar is poor or my writing style lacks finnes, I will do my best to express my thoughts as smoothly as possible in english.


So firstly I want to say that I love most of Sanderson's books especially the Stormlight Archive. I think he is amazing in many things like world building; the supernatural in his books is very original; character development seems real and complex ; the dialogue is great.
Well, maybe there is a bit too much description but we can live with it , cant we?
Anyway something I can't seem to get past is the development of love relationships in his books. I remember reading Mistborn and being very into it until the point where the main protagonist (female) chose her prince charming (very early on in the series) and that was it. I dropped the books right there.
Sadly I start to feel that is the way SA is going.
I know there is a lot of controversy between fans with whom should Shallan end up with and the notorious love triangle. I personally like her with Kal but I do not like to call myself a shipper in any way. Let me explain. I do not care with whom she ends up but please for the love of God make things interesting. I liked how things finished in book 3 because there is so much possibility for something fascinating to happen in the future. Shallan feels like Adolin is the right guy but has feelings for Kal due to them sharing an undeniably strong connection.
Kal loves her but steps away because he is honourable and feels great friendship towards Adolin. Perfect. Him trying to deny his feelings and her seemingly choosing one sets up the stage for the possibility of a great rift forming between them in the future and possibly destroying everything they fought to protect (aka Lancelot/Guinevere trope). 
Just please do not waste all that has been build and make it seem like a 12 years old choosing between the cute boy who bought her chocolate and the one who gave her flowers.
Actually after reading the third book I could not even comprehend that such a thing would be a possibility. But I guess it is. I saw many comments from Sanderson , quoting one:

""vanahian

And for a friend of mine and her sanity... The Shalladin thing will be something or is all in her head? Stop her pain please :D.

Brandon Sanderson

Shallan has made her choice. I wouldn't expect that to change.

vanahian

And thanks for the answer in 11. My friend is crying but now she can go ahead with her life ￼

Brandon Sanderson

Yeah...I do feel bad about that. If it's any comfort, tell her I think she'll eventually be very pleased it went this way. It might take a few more books, though.""


Like that is almost him saying ,,yea Shallan is stuck with Adolin now because he is a good boy and they will live happily ever after ,end of story"".
And what about the feelings between Shalan and Kaladin, what about the chemistry that he himself has build between them? Do they simply disappear ? And how did it happen? There are so much more logical questions to which the answers cant be just : ,,well he realised he does not love her and he is a man of duty anyway so we are all chilling"" &amp; ,,well I guess she likes the prince better he is way cuter and  nicer too haHha""

Next thing he does is to find some random character with no personality and developed relationship to set up with Kal so he can finally be happy and find peace. Really original. 

One last thing. If I am wrong mister Brandon and you actually manage to build some sort of tension and desire between the characters I apologise deeply. 
I do hope that happens because that would make me very happy because the books are amazing in so many ways.
PS I made this mainly because I want to have it written so when my fears become reality I can at least comfort myself with the knowledge of being right.",Stormlight_Archive,Let's talk about Sanderson's romance development

Well it sure sounds all good. He's contained. BUT HE ISN'T REALLY because he's COMING!!!

Hmm. So these screams and the blades are definitely heavily linked to the spren. And you need to be bonded to one to hear the screams. Screams of dying spren? Or spren losing their bond? Who knows haha.

Ironic Kaladin thinks it makes her unlikely to be a radiant haha. I wonder when he'll figure it out.

Oof. Risky move Shallan, but i think its neccessary!

Hopefully, maybe, this could redeem Kaladin since hes following the first ideal to protect lives. 

Why do i get the sense that leading the chasmfiend towards the warcamp may let it loose in the camps?! Eek!

Good to see Kal back being epic again!

Wow. Even more confirmation spren and blades are linked. But why isn't Pattern with Shallan? Why would he abandon her to stick with the blade? Odd.

Well, you may be annoying him Kaladin but its doing something at least to distract whilst Shallan gets her stuff. You don't even need to kill it, just get away from it once you've got what you need!

Ohh dear. He doesn't even have stormlight to heal now. Don't die Kal!

Woo he got some of the face. Yeah boiiii.

Wtf is Shallan doing?! That girl's crazy i tell ya😂

Omd. Poor kal with his leg. I can feel every collapse. 

Is that Syl weeping? This is heartbreaking. I really thought he would get stormlight from that gem!

Is that pattern? Wtf. Incredible! What a save. I wouldn't have even thought of that being a possible ending!

Why is it problematic? Because it would reveal she's a surgebinder? Or because Pattern isn't quite there yet with his illusions?

What are these spren eh?

Well i suppose shallan got what she wanted😂😂

Oh dear. Two hours on that leg? They're fucked.

What a genius idea! Lets hope they make it in two hours.

Hang on? How did Shallan do that?! No one else can command their blade to get smaller. That we've seen anyway.

Come on Kal, you can make it!

Ahh fuck. So close. Hold on Kal. Hold on.


73

Ooh. Is it coincidence that this kinda mirrors the time period they are in in the present day?

Oh poor Jushu. This really makes me sad. 

Oh poor souls. When will they find out Kaladin killed him? That's gonna be a rough one.

Ooh escape! Clearly it didn't work since Lin was murdered.

Uh oh. Already going wrong.

Ooh so they knew. Shallan had obviously just blotted things from her mind about Helleran.

Oh my. Poor Malise. This bastard deserves what he got.

What the fuck. Lin is a fucking heartless monster. Using an iron poker is insane. 

No way haha. I didn't even take notice of shallan giivng him the wine as out the ordinary. What a genius idea. I was convinced she was gonna use her shardblade to stab him and had blocked the memory. But i might've forgotten a mention of his poisoning back in WoK. Probably lol.

Uh oh. I suppose if he's paralysed he can't do much. 

Woah. That's fucking psychotic Shallan. Singing him a song whilst strangling him? Surely there's a less creepy way of doing it😅

Btw i loved the chapter title as description of the rain. It was an interesting image. 

Looking ahead, there are no more flashbacks, and yet we haven't solved the mystery of the mother's death and the light coming from the box in the room. Hmmm.

74

Well that's slightly dissapointing a reply to the letter haha. I was hoping Frost would agree and we'd get an epic cosmere team up! Ah well. Its cool to see the response anyway.

Oh boy! Back to Kaladin! It was literally a cliffhanger before haha.

Ooh ok just in the nick of time eh! 

Why is surge in italics like that? Is that a hint that Shallan's strength is from her powers? Hmm.

Wtf. Is this the stormfather or what? What a weird storm vision. Filed in my mind for future reference aha.

Yes kaladin. What have you done to syl. You've killed her thats what. Well killed her access to the physical realm anyway. Asshole!

What is going on with kal. Hes seeing weird lights, the stormfather? And parshendi chanting, odium spren. And whats this alien figure following the first one? So many questions rn.

Well this is an intense experience to bond over. It'll sure draw them closer together. But i don't want them being in a damn love triangle damn it. This better be worth it Sanderson, i trust you!

Well at least Kaladin is becoming a littls self aware. Realising some of the good in his life. 

Uh oh. Has she made the connection? 

Oof. Kaladin is lucky eh. His subconscious saved him.

Oh my goodness it IS the stormfather and its talking to him! That doesn't explain all the visions here quite enough though. What about the parshendi and stuff?

I knew it! So Syl is dead. Cryyyy crryyyyyy.

But we do get a tantalising hint here. The day of recreance they must have done things to break the bond and kill their spren. This is why the stormfather forbid honorspren from bonding. So why did Syl choose to leave now? Why did none do it since? Maybe the spren know more about the coming dangers than we do right now.

Well hes finally fucking twigged it. Well done Sherlock.

Omd her too?!! Why did Shallan see the stormfather if she's an lightweaver?

Hmm. It is true we heard Syl weeping. I suspect she isn't dead fully. Just dead in the physical realm.

75

With a name like true glory, this chapter better live up to it!!

Oooh very foreboding aha. Odium is definitely a big player in the Cosmere as a whole. Maybe even a Thanos type figure. 

Bastard is trying to lobby for Sadeas. Asshole.

Plans for Amaram? What plans eh?

What happened to those Parshendi they saw the other day? And i wanna see what Adolin is up to considering his fiance probably died the other day from his perspective. 

Yeah Amaram, the voidbringers might be coming because you want them to fucking return. You've been advocating for this secretly! So the unite them definitely can't mean the highprinces because if Amaram wants then united, it cannot be good. I'm now convinced it means unite the radiants and not Alethkar.

I still don't fully understand why he appointed Amaram of all people to check that story out. Odd.
He already had his ardents at work.

Oh my, he's running. That's so cute aha.

Goodness his status must be legendary now. He's survived two highstorms and falling down a chasm.

Could this finally be when Kaladin reveals his true self to Dalinar? 

Wow. Still a bridgeman to the core. Such devotion. I still don't quite understand it considering his hatred for the lighteyes and willingness to assasinate Elhokar but he's a bit of an odd fellow. 

Ah so he's choosing to keep his radiant status hidden. I suppose it makes sense considering he's lost Syl.

Yeahhh, he never was the best liar was he😂 luckily Shallan is there for him and its kinda part of her order😂

Hang on a second, why is Navani so motherly all of a sudden?! Weird eh.

Ooh more setup for later. I hope Kaladin does actually get to speak to him.

Oh ho ho this is gettinf spicy. Dalinar knows now. Well, sort of.

Yeah she,uh, really isn't doing much of a good job at all is she at keeping that secret. I'm sure the whole bleeding camp knows by now😂😂

Aha. So cryptic spren are patterns in nature without the bond. Interesting.

And doubling down on the recreance eh. So the stormfather is most definitely a spren. An unusual one at that. Which others survived? And i wonder if there are any radiants left, hidden by time, that could bring the OG spren back?!

Hmm. So when did she say the words then? When she was young i guess. There have been subtle signs throughout the book.

Oh my. that's very forward for Adolin aha.

Oof. Dalinar is real going for it now with that ultimatum.

Ooh an expedition. Without parshmen. I wonder where Shen got to. So many unanswered qs aha. Ghostbloods, voidbringers, teft, the nightwatcher, shallan's mother in that box, who was the spy, who wrote the warnings on the wall, can Syl be returned, what is Taravangian up to, what is Amaram really up to, who is the man killing radiants. So many. And yet many answered.

762,"Hello everyone,   
I've just finished part one and the interlude plus some chapters from part 2. This book is definitely an improvement from the Well of Ascension, my last cremverse-book (finally I understand where that word comes from) thanks for nothing r/cremposting :D) although the shard magic is somewhat similar so far

My favorite chapter so far is the one with the assassination plot, and the interludes which had some worldbuilding in them. And I don't know who that lake hippie was from the first interlude but I thought the dynamics with him were funny.

That little spren Syl is an intersting side character. Looking forward to seeing her develop.

I hope Sadeas isn't going to be ""revealed"" as a bad guy because that would be very predictable from the set-up.   


Although on a side note/rant: I can't stand the character known as the Wit. He's the antithesis of ""wit"". And he also comes across as Breeze 2.0, a character that tries to sound clever but fails to manage that due to the prose. Also beginning every sentence with ""Ahhh..."" isn't good banter. In-world canon, it's even worse that they reveal that this clown is not even mentally-handicapped which makes him look even more like a half-wit. /rant",Stormlight_Archive,TWOK First impressions (and a Wit diss track)
763,"So here's the deal. Dalinar has a vision not sent to him by Stormfather in which he speaks with Nohadon. He acts strangely, and Dalinar feels the strange light and warmth that he sees a few other times, which by the end of Oathbringer it's safe to assume is associated with his closeness to Honor. In the vision, he follows Nohadon around town, learns that Nohadon was a Surgebinder, and while in a dwelling with Nohadon hears a Thunderclast banging around outside.

My assertion: Dalinar is a Bondsmith, Nohadon was too, and the Bondsmiths can send visions to future Bondsmiths. The vision with old Nohadon was sent by Nohadon himself to the future of his Order, much like Honor did - not to Dalinar specifically, but blindly, with some sort of guiding force for the visions, likely from the Spiritual Realm. As a Bondsmith, the powers of Tension and Adhesion combine, and their resonance allows them to summon their own Thunderclast. The Thunderclast wandering around the village in Dalinar's vision was Nohadon's Thunderclast, and as Dalinar progresses in his Oaths he, too, will gain the power to summon one.

Originally I considered that his Thunderclast might be inhabited by Stormfather, but I can't imagine Stormfather being bound in a body of rock, no way. Now, I'm thinking maybe it's a resonance effect that results in something extremely similar to Awakening.

777,"If you're itching for the fourth book like me, I have a suggestion to tide you over. The Brightest Shadow isn't a Sanderson book but it fed some of the same hunger for epic fantasy. It was a great read so I'm going to recommend it and do a little comparison.

**Plot**: I think TBS and SA are pretty similar here. Even down to how some readers quit the book early on. A lot of cool stuff happens but it takes a while to build up. I get how the beginning is important for fleshing out the world and characters but I actually got bored. It was worth it in the end, but it takes a while to build up. Not quite a Sanderson avalanche, though the ending was great.

**Worldbuilding**: SA definitely has the more radically different world with more inventive stuff. But TBS also has a world that feels richly drawn and isn't a typical castles/knights fantasy setting. It draws from a lot of Asian cultures in a way that feels really fresh.

**Magic**: SA has more formal ""class-like"" magic systems. TBS is more like if people could choose individual powers from any Surge, but it took years of training to develop each one. So there's an element of choosing ones that work together instead of just a grab bag of random powers.

**Characters**: This one is hard to compare. I thought both have some pretty memorable characters and there's a Kaladin-like guy in TBS, but overall they're fairly different. I've seen some readers get frustrated with how the characters are trapped/imprisoned in both books but I thought those parts were important.

**Interludes**: These are uncommon enough that I'm pretty sure TBS took inspiration from SA. SA has more (probably better) interludes and they're wider ranging. I still liked the ones in TBS because they're related to the main plot, like showing you a completely different perspective on the main story or the consequences of the characters' actions.

The book is on sale for its launch so it's just $2.99 for a book that's 75% as long as Way of Kings. I spent way too long sitting on this but I thought it was amazing in the end.",Stormlight_Archive,The Brightest Shadow is a great book to tide you over while you wait for Stormlight 4 (comparison/review)

780,"I'm re-reading the books again and I noticed that Kaladin mentions a character named Tarah a couple of times.  

The  first time I read it the truth is that I did not realize this (or at  least I do not remember), and I am not aware that it has ever appeared  beyond more mentions.  I am in Radiant Words in my re-reading, has she  appeared only in those mentions or do I have mental lapses and I don't  remember?

781,"I designed some Shardblades! From left to right are Oathbringer, Sunraiser, Firestorm, Mayalaran, Sylblade and Sylspear. I wanted the blades to embody light and have an ethereal glow to them. For Maya the side crystals were really tough, I kept going back and forth with how I wanted the crystal ridge to look but overall pretty pleased with how it turned out. For both of Syl’s designs I wanted to embody the idea of flight since she’s a wind spren, hence the wings!

782,"During my reread of Oathbringer I came across this passage when Dalinar was looking for a drink while dealing with his guilt over the Rift-  ""At the back of the porch, he found Ahu huddled in the shadows between two large religious statues, their backs facing the beggars, their hands spread toward the gardens."" 

We know by the end of the book that Ahu is none other than &gt;!Jezrien!&lt;, and I think it's excellent symbolism to have him hide in a spot that serves as a physical metaphor of the Heralds turning their back on the people. I just wanted to point out how awesome Sanderson is and how even after multiple readings I still pick up on little clues and metaphors all over his books that I hadn't seen before.",Stormlight_Archive,Great Symbolism
783,"I cried the second time. He was so close. *Do it, Elhokar*. I cried for his limping journey, and I cried for his unexpected destination.

The first time, though? I have only lost my shit so hard once before from a scene in a book. Moash is the cheekiest motherfucker on the face of the planet. I laughed myself silly. I laughed until tears came out. I laughed until I saw stars. This scene is *so good*, and in my first read-through I was too overwhelmed with satisfaction for Moash to feel bad for Elhokar.

Moash respects Kaladin. He fulfills the oath he and Kaladin made together, the one Kaladin broke. Moash gets his revenge, and in his eyes he brings justice to an oppressor. He understands that Kaladin had to do what he did. He hates himself for betraying his friend, but he also knows, *he knows*, that there's part of Kaladin that understands and agrees. Kaladin had to fight his own desires, and the line between them is so close, they're like a pair of tied sneakers on opposite sides of the phone lines, side-by-side but with only tension between them.

I love Moash. I identify deeply with Moash. I've hated in my life. I've thought that there are people who deserve to die, and there have been times in my life when I could have been a very scary person. The things that make Dalinar so powerful and loveable for me, I see in Moash as well, and Moash has more justification for the horrible things he's done than Dalinar ever did. I have had time to grow and learn that Moash did not have, and I wish I could give him a hug.

It's easy to see ourselves in our heroes. Dalinar teaches us to forgive ourselves and improve. Kaladin teaches us how to find ways to care for others. Shallan... well, who knows with that girl. 

It's much harder to see ourselves in our villains. I see myself in Moash, and I love him. I'm not that person anymore, but it took a pretty serious journey to get here. We don't all get that luxury in life, and Moash shows us all how few bad choices it really takes to find yourself lost in the wilderness with only the darkness to cling to. The journeys of our protagonist Radiants aren't any more noble than Moash's, they're just further along. As Hoid says, what people value most is novelty, and Moash is late to the party. Indeed, there are a lot of similarities between Kaladin's chapters in The Way of Kings and Moash's chapters in Oathbringer. Their slavery, their drudgery, their eventual break and submission to their anger.

I don't know Moash's destination, but I am excited to see the rest of his journey.

Ah Kholinar. I don't believe we've spent much, if any time at all here. 

The queen as well. A mysterious figure since we've barely been introduced. Tbh until the previous mention of the queen, I'd forgotten she'd existed. 

Hmm. A nameless woman. Odd. What's she hiding.

Ooh I'd forgotten there were so many epoch kingdoms.

Those windblades sound interesting. I'd like to learn more of them too brother Lhan.

What do you call people who cobble but don't cobble 😂😂. Love it.

Pai. And doesn't sound Alethi. Who is she really?

Now i like Lhan. He seems amenable. But i have to agree with Pai here.

More insight into Lhan's mind. He seems nice but clearly he's just caring about number one.

Hmm. Who is Rener and why is HE associated with the miracle?!

Lhan makes good points here. Change the system from the inside!

Ouch. She really tears apart the system here eh.

Yayy. Maybe she can do some good!

Rip. That was over quick😂😂 we've heard of thess ten fools and stuff before. I wonder if we will actually learn of them and their attributes?

Short one. Shame. I like the Parshendi. But its confirmed what i was noticing. Venli hasn't changed at all really. She is hidiing something and its something dangerous. Eek.

Interlude 14

Finally, back to Taravangian! I've been eager to discover more of what he has been up to and why. It's also the centre of all the Jah Keved chaos. Maybe we'll learn what's happened to Shallan's family.

Where are all these aches from? Could just be old age i suppose but there seems something more to it.

Ooh whats on the ship?

Huh? So this Mrall sorta controls him? Why? Is he an agent of Odium? Also he sounds Indian on the GA which is not how i expected🤣

Has he got Parkinson's or dementia or sommat? And what's this Diagram he isn't allowed to comment on?

Suffering. What is Taravangian convinced is so important about these death rattles that he would go against his morals since he seems to have a consicence at least. Although twisted ones at that. 

This Mrall is a bit of an odd fella. Idk whats up with him. Something is off about him.

Ahh so this is a book of his crazy ramblings. Interesting. And yet he knows Honor is dead. This is kinda like the glyphs on Dalinar's walls. But incoherent ones. He knows so much on the one hand and yet uses it for nefarious purposes on the other. Why?!

Ooh is this madness/ genius thing due to visiting the nightwatcher? Did he ask for a day of unparalleled genius? He could hold the key to the whole SA endgame. And yet he uses it for ill. So sad.

This Mrall really irks me. What an nasty little cock he is🤣 

So much destruction and devestation. I can imagine it in my mind and it pains me to see it, especially knowing its Shallan's home. All cus of one man who believes himself to be a genius and is manipulating for his evil ends.

Whats Moleach? Some kind of supernatural force? Another name for Odium?

I totally disagree with Taravangian's philosophy here because his attempts have clearly proven fruitless. He is no closer to the truth than when he started. Sometimes it could be justified but they are very rare times and results are needed. This isnt the case here.

Oh wow so this shit is like a full on cult level now. Madness. And an ardent believes a heretic? Insane!

Wow good. He's finally realising the idiocy of this harebrained scheme. Perhaps he may even stop everything because the chances of another day of genius are so low!

So this Diagram isn't even completely accurate? So why the fuck are they following it to kill people?!

An evil spren. Omd is this the thing Syl has been seing. And what then is Moleach? I guess it got something right but that could just be pure chance and we don't know how much more will be correct.

Good, you should be second guessing yourself Taravangian!!

Aha so this seems to confirm he went to the nightwatcher and got a boon of intelligence and a curse of compassion for the hurt he causes through his intelligence. 

Szeth! Last time we saw this dude he was at Urithiru. But he forgot to leave any clues about where it is, the selfish bastard! 

Ooh so Szeth could kill him eh. I like that possibility. And i do like Szeth. Despite his killing, i find him very interesting and i like him. 

Ah so Taravangian knows Jasnah was a radiant. Does he know of the others? Perhaps even ones under our noses?! And i knew it haha. I suspected she might've faked her death since we didn't fully see her die on screen. It just seemed pretty dire. We never saw a last breath. This isn't confirmation, but it is fuel for my theory to return! Why add that little snippet in otherwise?

Why is he so convinced it isnt a radiant. Is it perhaps because it could prove the diagram wrong! This also tells us the Shin have honorblades so that must be what Szeth has. The blades from the heralds right? So szeth has one. There should be nine others. Who has the other two? And does this mean one of the Kholin's is secretly a radiant and has an honorblade? That would be quite something to hide. Hmm. And if they were a radiant they would have a shardblade. Although Kaladin doesn't. Hmm lots to ponder on.

Hmm. Were they involved in Heleran's death somehow? They've clearly been aware of Shallan. Maybe they're involved with the ghostbloods somehow. All these secret societies seem connected to one another lol.

Ha. Adolin might be a shardbearer but he is certainly no radiant yet. Im sure i would've seen the signs. Renarin cant be either. Look at how he fights and i feel he would've shown off his powers by accident now. No i feel there is another hidden radiant perhaps, but this is suggested to throw us off the scent. Haha nice try Sanderson but you won't catch me out. Probably 😂

Ahh so it is clarity he asked for. Ironic thay this statement gave me clarity 😂😂 this has sorta changed my perception a little. I don't believe the death and destruction is right. However i think Taravangian is a good man at heart. He has just been corrupted by going to the nightwatcher. Who's side is she on eh. But this proves how he will be key to the end of the SA I'm imagining. I mean he knows how to stop the end of the world. Its a noble desire with horrific means. I don't envy his position now.

Oh no. They're onto Kaladin. What does that mean for him? Especially if they figure out its him but they don't know he's lost the bond. Are the radiants bad? We're just seeing it all from our perspective but i could see a path being forged where the return of the radiants helps bring back Odium and destruction. 

I wonder what this death rattle means. The night reigns sounds like it means the evil will win, but the 2nd half is a bit harder to guess. Will this be a choice Kaladin makes? Life instead of sacrifice for defeat against evil? Or is it a choice honor himself has made. Who knows eh.

Ooh i dont like the sound of that. The first step to unification. Sounds bad if its Taravangian. I am now utterly convinced the unite them refers to the radiants. And do these visions run in the Kholin family? Why else would they both receive them eh? And seems like Taravangian is tied up with the same people Amaram is maybe. At odds with the ghostbloods.

Early into the read when I got introduced to Jasnah I googled a picture of her, and in the google suggestions it appeared: “Jasnah Death.” so maybe I am spoiled on her dying. And recently when I got to part 3 Dying and joined Shallan’s POV I kinda forgot that she had a photographic memory so I googled that, and with squinted eyes I saw something (couldn’t read it though because of the squinting) and kinda maybe got spoiled that it’s magical?

799,"I'm now halfway through The Way of Kings (for reference, volume 1 ends with Shallan stealing Jasnah's fabrial, which has another name that I forgot already, stormcaster or something) and it is a fantastic book. Each character feels real and solid, and although thier individual plotlines don't have much correlation yet, it's still great. Particularaly Kaladin's perspective is really interesting to me. Also, GALLADON'S A FLIPPING WORLDHOPPER, so, you know, that happened. 

I'm gonna make some predictions now, but I don't want any spoilers. I'll do them by character. Kaladin definivly can use Stormlight to increase his endurance. His bridge runs implied it, and his surviving the highstorm proves it. I suspect that the event regarding Tien that he regrets is possibly that Tien was badly injured in a place where his father couldn't operate on him, or that his father trusted Kal to save him, but he fails, driving him to the army rather than to train as a surgeon. Then, in the army, he manages to kill a shardbearer, but refuses to take the Shardplate or Shardblade for some reason. This results in Brightlord Amaran (?) selling him as a slave and making him mistrustful of lighteyes. I don't know what the face he saw in the highstorm is (Odium?) but I'm sure that it is very important somehow.

Shallan should hide the fabrial and claim that she has family matters to attend to, then return to her brothers. Depending on how she feels about Jasnah now and if her theft is discovered (which it will be), she may or may not choose to return to her wardship. This may result in her ending up on the shattered plains if Jasnah finds whatever she's looking for before Shallan's discovered. I have no real idea where Shallan is going, but I'm really interested to find out.

I have no predictions for Adolin.

Dalinar is returning to his estates, but it is possible that something prevents him from leaving. His visions are not delusions, and he could discover this by fact-checking them with historical accounts. The use of ""life before death"" in a vision makes ma suspect that he will discover the full ""ancient oaths"" mentioned in the blurb, and it will be a major plot point. These are related to Galivar's message, ""You must find the most important words a man can say."" 

Szeth I have no idea about, but he is clearly important to revealing the true threat and essential to the story in some way.

Those are my predictions. Again, no spoilers please, I'd like to confirm or deny them myself, through reading.",Stormlight_Archive,"Just finished the first volume of The Way of Kings, and I have some predictions..."
800,"The evil storm is raging, but the red clouds open with burst of light, as a chariot lead by two of those creatures whose names I forgot from Shadesmar which pull the ships, flies through the hole, my man Dalinar is standing in the chariot, bringing all of three realms almost into one, showing both of his middle fingers to Odium. 

Man, what a ride. What now? I postponed reading of the book 3 as long as possible, because I read first two too fast. But today I finished it. In my last reports, I always forget to mention some of the interesting things, because I get lost in my emotions. So before I start, I always forgot on the goddamn Wit, first time I read about him something connected him with the court fool, and I read or heard somewhere how often court's fools were used in stories as characters who weren't really fools, but know much more of what's happening then our main characters, and of course, he's some mythical Godspren who likes to fuck around, and wants to help humans, but has to hide from Odium. I always enjoy his jokes, and when he was first time, or at least it seemed so to me, sincere towards my girl Shallan, my heart broke. I can't wait to find out who's he really, there are probably hints inside the books, but my mind is too slow to connect those. So Pattern's jokes are killing me, when I think Adolin (I’m not sure) talks to him, and say something like: our odd group of seven. Pattern agrees, and says: seven, yes odd. Man, first I had a huge grin on my face, and then I started laughing like a maniac. Oh, I love dumb jokes. Then when they started exploring Ururlururu (or how it's called), I started seeing some clues that it might be some huge ˝alive˝ structure powered by stormlight, and at the beginning they had problems with powering the gates, and it reminded me of Stargate Atlantis, where the whole city was a huge space ship, and was powered by ZPM's and they never could get enough of it. What if Ururluru is a huge space ship, it's shaped like some form of a rocket, imagine Radiants flying into space. Other thing that crossed my mind was, if Kal my inspiration flies by falling upwards, if he had enough stormlight could he ˝fall up˝ into the space? When Szeth got the sword, I was like: noooo way! Then as story progressed and we met that woman who defended Kholinar and ended up in Cognitive world with the crew, and I was like who was she? She's searching for what? A sword? Oh, it the evil killer 100%! It is. And she knows their sword master? Wait, what? Is she Vivienna and is the sword master goddamn God walking the planet Vasher?!?!?!?!?!? Mindblown. What's going on?!?!?!? Now what? Humans are invaders? Wait, are these humans from the Warbringer planet? What happened? So every planet has different magic system? Or is the universe different? 

So, I will ˝start˝ with Dalinar, my man, I mean I always thought he was a mean machine, don't fuck with the dude, but as his history revels itself, this dude is a one man army! So while reading Brandon Sanderson's books, I may be wrong but I noticed how you can't really fight fire with fire. So we have ˝good˝ Gods, and ˝bad˝ Gods, and some shit happened eons ago, where some dudes killed the one God, and divided him into 10 Gods or something like that, my memory is fuzzy, but if you want to support the ˝good˝ guys, you need to rise above petty human emotions and your ego, you will still need violence, but you shouldn't enjoy it, you just accept it as a necessary way. So the more you let your primal emotions take over you, the more you are in line with the ˝bad˝ Gods. So following that logic, I thought how Dalinar needs to accept his bad deeds, as Syl had said all of radiants were broken, but I wasn't prepared for the shit that happened. He burned a whole goddamn town and by accident his own wife? He was an asshole who could only be happy when killing or drinking? And he just hid from it like a coward? But, all of that shit is repaid, after trillion betrayals, some mistakes made which is human, dude tells Odium in his face to fuck off, and he runs away like a scared rabbit! Where is your all power now, you eternal force of ˝confidence˝? But, Dalinar has accepted what he has done, and he will suffer for it. No matter do I agree or not agree with him, I can't deny that he's one of my favorite characters. Now dude's like additional battery for your cellphone, that people used massively when Pokemon Go was popular, and they weren't jumping around bushes to catch pokemons, just he fills other people with stormlight. Also, in one book I read, which I won't name but I presume people who read it will understand, main bad guy didn't want to kill the good guy, but he wanted him on his side, so I wondered will same happen with my man Dalinar? And it did. This made a lot of more sense for me, as I got to know what a beast Dalinar is. I always thought of him as of a character who was a bad ass, but you know, nothing really that special, then I found out about his past, and it made sense that Odium wanted him as his champion.

Shallan my girl! The more story progresses, the more I like her. Even her witty comments, even though at some point I thought they were overused, couldn't get me to stop liking her. So many insecurities and Kal is like: How are you so confident? If you only knew, you bridge carrier. Her inner fears, splitting personalities, glancing at poor Kal, confusing poor Adolin, what are you doing girl? But hey, we have one of the ancient sprens, that are evil, and we don't really know what the hell are they precisely, or how to fight them, but let's send Shallana and hope she will figure it out, we will do what we the Alethi do the best, hit other people with swords, poke them with sticks, smash their faces and so on. So in the end she creates a ˝real˝ illusions to hold on those mad Sadeas men, and the queen does her job, splits into three personalities, but doesn't complain, confesses everything to Adolin, and chooses him as his love, thank the Honor it happened, because if there was rift between her, Adolin and Kal, I would shoot myself in one of my knees, if not both. Then she unites with her family and marries Adolin! 

Adolin, well, I like him, its official. When he killed Sadeas it filled me with joy, and I hoped it wouldn't corrupt him, because that somehow seemed cliché, and even though it created problems for his inner peace, he found out he wasn't sorry, and that made him even more likable. He confessed his sins, talks about how he's useless, but fights a goddamn stone monster without a shardplate. Yeah, I wish I was useless like that. I wondered how would the saga with Sadeas end, and when his army turned red eyes, I was thanking Gods and sprens it didn't turn into some ˝you are going to court˝ shit. It didn't. My question is, at what point will spren from his sword awaken? Tntntntntnntnt

Kal, last time I asked will he be broken again, but now I expect him to be broken every book until the end. Brandon just can't let the dude enjoy his life for 5 minutes. The moment he broke when the king got killed, I understood him. I didn’t feel it as his failure, but what is the point? Every question I asked myself before, he has asked himself. How do you know what’s wrong and what’s good? Is there some objective way you could look at it? One people fight for their freedom, other people defend themselves, and in the middle of it all Kal trying to figure out the right thing to do. How do spren perceive honor? Is it honor killing ex slaves who suffered oppression? I have a feeling that I would do same shit Radiants did, like fuck off all of you, Gods, this planet, this whole universe. But, because our Kal isn’t a mere human, he doesn’t succumb for long! He gets a vision, from whom we don’t know (at least I don’t, but it could be separate entity from Stormface, who also at one or two points talked to Dalinar), and finds new purpose. Defend Dalinar. Make this shit work, no matter how much the truth hurts. Goes to battlefield, fights Amaramamam and 8 voidbringers, somehow survives, Rock kills the Amarmamama, what? Sits down, breaks. No man, I suspect you are the fourth child, you liar. No need to feel ashamed. But, how will they address the problem with humans being invaders? Will their beliefs be shattered? Will they behave like certain tribes from certain book whose name I won’t mention, again? Or will they stand united? Will this be the next thing that will break Kal? I have a feeling that he will be broken dozens of times until he speaks all of the words.

Jasnah, so my favorite woman in the series, tight competition with Shallan, I confess, I like them both the same now, it’s hard to decide. She comes back from the cognitive world, she kicked ass there, she kicks ass here. Adolin rushes to help Jasnah to protect the whole in the wall. She doesn’t need help. What did you think? You lost yourself a bit again, didn’t you? Creates things out of thin air, waves her shardblade few times, result?  Wall hole defended. Says to Shallan you need my help, Shallan doesn’t need her help, Shallan realizes she needs her help. Of course you do, bloody Jasnah told you so. Then she goes to do what needs to be done, kill her nephew, or wtf is he to her, and what happens? He turns around, she remembers all of the time she spent with him, he prepares for death, but no, Jasnah shows mercy, one more right decision. Does research, fights evil, and in the end walks in the room with the crown on her head. What are you looking at, weaklings? You are looking at the new queen, bitches.

So that old weasel works for Odium now? How long will Dalinar be a trusting fool? He should have stabbed him in the eye while they were looking at pictures of the Radiants.

804,"The Death Rattle of the first chapter of The Way of Kings, ""Stormblessed"", is:

&gt;“You've killed me. Bastards, you've killed me! While the sun is still hot, I die! ”

&gt;—Collected on Betabachah 1171, 10 seconds pre-death, by the Silent Gatherers. Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirty-one years of age. Sample is considered questionable.

This made me think about Yet Another Unity Theory (YAUT). Can we have this as a tag? ;) 

Basically what Odium says in Chapter 119 of Oathbringer, ""Unity"":

&gt;“No!” Odium screamed. He stepped forward. “No, we killed you. WE KILLED YOU!”

I see an interesting parallel about the phrasing of these: There is the you/me word on both, and a reference to a group of people 'bastards'/'we' killing somebody. 

Also, going complete crackpot here, the Sun reminds me to the other Sun/warmth/light that Dalinar senses throughout Oathbringer, suspected to be related with Unity.

I figured now is a better time than any to do this since we are slooooooowlyyyy approaching the release date of book four. I do not have a set date for when we would start this because it depends on how many people would be interested in joining on this journey with me. This is a wonderful series and maybe we could bring in some new readers as well so that they can experience the wonder and pure enjoyment that this series brings.

844,"**TL;DR: Adolin becomes an alcoholic in book 4.**

*Evidence*:

1.  Adolin shows some signs of being disposed to alcoholism.  In tWoK and WoR, Adolin frequently enjoys going to winehouses, ostensibly for the social aspect.  However, he doesn’t care about wine, doesn’t know the differences between them, chafes at his father’s restrictions to not get too intoxicated, and says al wines taste the same to him.  I see several alarms here that Adolin wants to drink just to drink, he just hasn't had the time and opportunity.  

Being involved in a protracted war where his wife, former-body guard, father, cousin, and even little brother are now super-humans may make him feel inferior.  We've already seen the flashes of jealousy with Kaladin, maybe the long-running war makes this jealousy grow into resentment.

2.  This WOB about alcoholism in the Kholin family.  The WOB was before Oathbringer, so the “next book” he refers to is not RoW.  However, I think the family tie in the WoB below does suggest that alcoholism is still a risk for the Kholins.

&gt;**Questioner**  
&gt;  
&gt;Do they have a concept of alcoholism in Roshar?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Brandon Sanderson**  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Questioner**  
&gt;  
&gt;Does Dalinar’s family have it?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Brandon Sanderson**  
&gt;  
&gt;That will be answered in the next book, but you should definitely be asking that question.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Calamity Austin signing (Feb. 25, 2016)](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/13/#e4997)

3.  Adolin falling into and dealing with alcoholism can advance some key story lines and create some interesting developments.  For example, at the end of Oathbringer, Shallan says that Adolin likes to go drinking with Veil.  I think they may start having their benders too frequently, to the point where Veil/Shallan gets worried about Adolin. 

I also can see some interesting interactions between an Adolin on the way to rock-bottom and Kaladin where we see some role-reversal from their previous interactions.  For example, Adolin tried to keep Kaladin’s chin up in Shadesmar after the failed attempt to save Khloinar where Kaladin tragically watched different groups of his friends kill each other.  Kaladin may have to retrun the favor and pull Adolin out of his own self-destructive path.

*Impact*:

For everyone that loves Adolin (me included), don’t kill me yet!  I think this could lead to a redemption arc for Adolin where he eventually becomes a Knight Radiant, likely including reviving Maya.

*Counterpoints*:

\-Adolin is just too good of a guy!  I agree with this point, and I love how his character has grown.  Good old affable Adolin won't let riding shotgun to a bunch of Knights Radiant affect him.  He'll be happy to help in any way he can.  Heck, the guy rejected the Throne of Alethkar when Dalinar suggested he take it.

Hmm i recognise this from somewhere😉😉😂. I'm intrigued to get these diagram posts. Clearly this is about the radiants as seen in interlude 14. I wonder if people will start being outed.

Well I'm glad he's feeling guilt about Syl because quite honestly he was being selfish. But i do hate to see him with his leg destroyed like this. If he can get so broken where can he go from here. Will Szeth kill him off? Would be quite the shocker. 

Storms i love Lopen. Always trying to see the bright side and keep people happy. He's like a bundle of happiness.

My goodness, what a glorious image that is. I can see it now. Yeah its a little cheesy but to hell with that. Sanderson's forte is taking what could be cheesy because it sticks so close to genre tropes and elevating the fuck outta them.

Go Sebarial! I liked this dude since the start. Even if he's still a little bit of a mystery to me in terms of his motives and goals. Seems like Dalinar has made some progress indeed. Full disclosure though, i did just spend a full page reading Sebarial as Sadeas before realising my error when i was confused 😂😂🙄

Ooh i can't stand those two. I wonder why Sebarial has caught their eye so much. I mean i guess its because of the expansion, but surely dalinar is their primary focus rn. 

Oof. Whats in that letter eh?

Hmm. I must say i don't take to this retcon of Aladar. When reading his objections it never came across as someone trying to convince themselves. It came across as true objections and opposition. 

Well idk if this makes me trust Aladar. He still didn't say the words promise after all, but i trust Dalinar knows what he's doing.

What was Amaram gonna do that he only wants 2 of them eh? I seriously don't trust this sneaky fucker. This is one man i wish Taravangian had killed! And this confrontation with Kaladin probably won't end well. Gonna turn Kaladin away again..why can't you just storming trust the man Dalinar. Do some better research. 

Uugh. Enough with this bloody love triangle already!

Hmm. I didn't consider Renarin's explanation that odd. Whats up with that?

Oh boy, here we go.

Fuck. Moash is gonna kill Elhokar. Damnation!

Huh? Dalinar was on his side the entire time? I knew he was an honourable man!

No way! He has another blade!! Woop woop..this can only serve him well in the future. 

Ahhh so thats why he was ill. And he was brooding at the back when Kaladin was released! It all makes sense now.

I wonder what we can do with Amaram now. I hope he gets executed. But can Dalinar trust him in battle? I don't know anymore. He's only in it for his own interests.

Well clearly this is a special blade coming from a herald. Must be why Dalinar says it feels so weird.

Uugh. Can someone just stab storming Sadeas already?! 

77

Hmm ok. This seems like it could be about Szeth and him potentially triggering new radiants to emerge. Foreshadowing?!

Hmm what's Gaz up to eh.

Can we just stop this Sanderson! We really do NOT need a storming love triangle.

Aha wow. He didn't run away. He's useful! I feel like this book could be key to the end.

So we learn a little more here than we did before, or certainly i did or forgot at least lol. If windrunners work in teams, who will be Kaladin's team member i wonder. 

It comes!!! Is this the everstorm or odium eh? Or both!

I feel we're so close to discovering the truth here about Urithiru. Its teasing me! What are these oathgates and how do they work?!

Ooh Navani! Could this be the tipping point?! Exciting!!

Aww glad they've connected now. I've been waiting for this moment for a while.

Oof this could change things now shes aware of the radiants. A little progress here for sure. Leaving me intrigued for more. Although its felt a little like a calm before the storm chapter!

Oh Moash. Spheres just pocket change. He really has changed.

Its the weeping getting to him. Kal would try something if he wasn't so depressed.

78

What was left behind? I'm thinking atm that they sre talking about shardblades but the herald ones. And considering if they can make one of their own. Hmm.

Oof four days. We're getting close to the countdown!!

Jasnah's death still niggles me. Especially since Taravangian doesn't believe shes dead.

Ooh interesting. This sort of begins to answer the questions we have had about whether spren attract or they are attracted to. So creationspren are part of an unsual breed. I wonder what other spren have no purpose?

Wow. Shallan really is moving up in the world eh. It seems wherever she goes she always manages to take command eventually!

Interesting comments here. I guess it chimes with the way we viewed the parshendi in WoK and now seem them in a more balanced way. The Alethi have their coloured view of them and truth isnt always the same.

This is exactly what I've been saying! Unite the radiants, not the highprinces.

Oh my. Perhaps now Kaladin can reveal himself too! This is a major step forward. 

Uh oh. Parshendi here we come.

This is an awfully long and important conversation to be having whilst running!

😂😂 i definitely see some of Jasnah in her. But good for Shallan standing up for herself!

Hmm why did these Parshendi come? Are they scouts or are they the exiles?

Aha so they've now figured out there are different forms. Good.

Oh my. This isn't good because I'm still not entirely convinced the voidbringers are Parshendi! Don't get too hung up on this Shallan.

Shen! What shocking news shall he bring i wonder?! Onwards to chapter 79!

Not much to comment on this chapter tbh. I am suprised Rlain was a spy. I'd not even thought about the fact he was dullform and not parshmen. In fact, in my head they were one and the same. Its so obvious though. 

Interesting little tidbit on the gods. They chose to take on this hatred and they are ancient ones. Doesn't help much to guess what they are but its still more than we knew before!

3 more days. Oooh its so close!!

Ooh ominous. King of everything.

Aha. Is this it then?! Has she found the city at the centre? Maybe we can finally figure out what a storming oathgate is!

Uugh. I feel you Shallan. I wanted to disover too.

Boy, i hadn't even considered Narak and Stormseat being the same thing but of course it is! So storming obvious. 

I do love Sebarial 😂😂

Why is he suddenly not on her side?! 

Oof. That would be cool eh. Storming Narak and then escaping via an oathgate. They could all end up in Urithiru. And what would await them i wonder.
1 day left too! Eek!

Well at least Kal has a little bit of positive thinking. That he'll make it through. 

Oh dear. Whats Elhokar onto now.

Wow. This is a drunk rant to compete with the best haha. 

Don't do it Kal. Don't kill him. 

Gosh I'd almost forgotten he saw shadows as well. Clearly spren. So what order is he? And clearly Kaladin's betrayal of Syl has spread across Shadesmar. 

Wow. That was definitely very emotional coming from Elhokar. It kinda made me feel for him for the first time.",Stormlight_Archive,WoR ch 76- 80 readthrough

Hmm i recognise this from somewhere😉😉😂. I'm intrigued to get these diagram posts. Clearly this is about the radiants as seen in interlude 14. I wonder if people will start being outed.

Well I'm glad he's feeling guilt about Syl because quite honestly he was being selfish. But i do hate to see him with his leg destroyed like this. If he can get so broken where can he go from here. Will Szeth kill him off? Would be quite the shocker. 

Storms i love Lopen. Always trying to see the bright side and keep people happy. He's like a bundle of happiness.

My goodness, what a glorious image that is. I can see it now. Yeah its a little cheesy but to hell with that. Sanderson's forte is taking what could be cheesy because it sticks so close to genre tropes and elevating the fuck outta them.

Go Sebarial! I liked this dude since the start. Even if he's still a little bit of a mystery to me in terms of his motives and goals. Seems like Dalinar has made some progress indeed. Full disclosure though, i did just spend a full page reading Sebarial as Sadeas before realising my error when i was confused 😂😂🙄

Ooh i can't stand those two. I wonder why Sebarial has caught their eye so much. I mean i guess its because of the expansion, but surely dalinar is their primary focus rn. 

Oof. Whats in that letter eh?

Hmm. I must say i don't take to this retcon of Aladar. When reading his objections it never came across as someone trying to convince themselves. It came across as true objections and opposition. 

Well idk if this makes me trust Aladar. He still didn't say the words promise after all, but i trust Dalinar knows what he's doing.

What was Amaram gonna do that he only wants 2 of them eh? I seriously don't trust this sneaky fucker. This is one man i wish Taravangian had killed! And this confrontation with Kaladin probably won't end well. Gonna turn Kaladin away again..why can't you just storming trust the man Dalinar. Do some better research. 

Uugh. Enough with this bloody love triangle already!

Hmm. I didn't consider Renarin's explanation that odd. Whats up with that?

Oh boy, here we go.

Fuck. Moash is gonna kill Elhokar. Damnation!

Huh? Dalinar was on his side the entire time? I knew he was an honourable man!

No way! He has another blade!! Woop woop..this can only serve him well in the future. 

Ahhh so thats why he was ill. And he was brooding at the back when Kaladin was released! It all makes sense now.

I wonder what we can do with Amaram now. I hope he gets executed. But can Dalinar trust him in battle? I don't know anymore. He's only in it for his own interests.

Well clearly this is a special blade coming from a herald. Must be why Dalinar says it feels so weird.

Uugh. Can someone just stab storming Sadeas already?! 

77

Hmm ok. This seems like it could be about Szeth and him potentially triggering new radiants to emerge. Foreshadowing?!

Hmm what's Gaz up to eh.

Can we just stop this Sanderson! We really do NOT need a storming love triangle.

Aha wow. He didn't run away. He's useful! I feel like this book could be key to the end.

So we learn a little more here than we did before, or certainly i did or forgot at least lol. If windrunners work in teams, who will be Kaladin's team member i wonder. 

It comes!!! Is this the everstorm or odium eh? Or both!

I feel we're so close to discovering the truth here about Urithiru. Its teasing me! What are these oathgates and how do they work?!

Ooh Navani! Could this be the tipping point?! Exciting!!

Aww glad they've connected now. I've been waiting for this moment for a while.

Oof this could change things now shes aware of the radiants. A little progress here for sure. Leaving me intrigued for more. Although its felt a little like a calm before the storm chapter!

Oh Moash. Spheres just pocket change. He really has changed.

Its the weeping getting to him. Kal would try something if he wasn't so depressed.

78

What was left behind? I'm thinking atm that they sre talking about shardblades but the herald ones. And considering if they can make one of their own. Hmm.

850,"Si this is an idea that occured yo me while finishing WoR .
It's a theory about the other two spren with Who you bond to become a Bonddmith.
I think that because the Storm Father is a personofication or the collective idea of Honor but more importantly for the subject a personification of the High Storms I think that the other two spren :


1. 'Shards' of the  other Shardbearers (Odium and Cultivation) like the Nightwatcher would be the spren of Cultivation but for Odium se dont know what spren it is. I think that the unmade were an unique spren but were shattered by Odium so It couldnt be bonded with.


2.The other two spren represent fundamental aspects of Roshar like because the Storm Father always appears as the sky the other two spren are personifications of the mountains (we read múltiple times about the mountain gods shin adore) and the seas.",Stormlight_Archive,The other two Bondsmith spren

:D",Stormlight_Archive,LTB UK Rythms of war
855,"(Links are at the bottom)

Now, I will start this off by saying this might be just sheer stupidity, and a bit of a half-baked theory, and just kind of putting the tinfoil cap on, *but,* hear me out, what if the Bondsmiths were a backup plan for restoring Honor?

Now i am basing this off the theory that Dalinar was indeed &gt;!restoring Honor in the battle of Thaylenah!&lt; and the proof for this theory lies in the fact that the coppermind refers to the &gt;!perpendicularity created by Dalinar as Honor's perpendicularity but doesn't refer that way to the perpendicularities created by Elsecallers!&lt;

This theory is also further supported by the fact that &gt;!Odium in the final battle says to Dalinar 'We killed you!"" when he is doing his Honor thing and I think this is most certainly referring to Honor himself!&lt; .

So with that out of the way, what if Honor knew that he would be killed by Odium? After all, we know that odium has \[spoilers for Elantris and SFSITFOH\] &gt;!splintered, essentially killing, Dominion, Devotion and Ambition,!&lt;  so wouldn't Honor have known that Odium would have come for him and would have likely killed him?

So what if Honor wanted to prevent the deaths of the others, because he is so honorable? What if his plan was to sacrifice himself to trap Odium, weaken him, and then using &gt;!Cultivation's!&lt; powers to create a new Honor, overpower Rayse to kill him?

This is also supported by the fact that Dalinar &gt;!created the perpendicularity upon speaking the Third Ideal of the Bondsmiths, something to which the stormfather reacts by saying that this has never happened before,!&lt;.

What if the vision journals and cultivation's interference were going to act as catalysts to a broken man, progressing him to become a better and better Bondsmith so that he would end up reviving the shard of Honor?

But this theory can also go on a divergant route.

Also, from here on out, we are going to wear a tinfoil hat upon our tinfoil hat.

What if Honor's plan was to revive himself? Like Tanavast self?

We already know that the stormfather is the cognitive shadow of Tanavast and that Bondsmiths bond with the stormfather , so what *if*(I know these are a lot of ifs) &gt;!the Bondsmiths were supposed to fuse the shard they summoned of Honor with the stormfather, essentially reviving Tanavast himself??!&lt;

Ok the theory's done, poke as many holes as you can in it!

859,"First time poster here, long time lurker!

Hopefully I got all the appropriate flairs right, but just to be sure, be warned about spoilers for WoR ahead. 

So I am underway my second reading of WoR and had a question regarding the difference between Shardblades and Shardplate. Specifically during Adolin's duel against the 4 shardbearers when Kaladin catches Relis's shardblade and he hears screaming. I know why he hears screaming since we find out those shards are essentially dead spren, but when he was using the helm of shardplate to fight, nothing really happened. 

Also, Syl seems to make a point of specifically stating she hates the Blades, but never really mentions the Plate. I know Radiants are going to get their plate in later oath's, but are they going separate from the spren they form the nahel bond with?

***some very vague spoilers of oathbringer and warbreaker***



I'm just curious as I just finished the stormlight archive books and am currently finishing warbreaker. All in a very short space of time.

 I've noticed that in both oathbringer and warbreaker a character says ""do it anyway"" in a pretty meaningful scene. Adolin to Shallan at the oathgate and Vivenna to Vasher about the army. I have read the mistborn books but years ago so I can't remember.

Does this mean that the sword Talenel brought was not an honorblade, that the sword that Dalinar hid was not the blade that Talenel brought with him, or that screams are also heard when they touch the honorblades and not only with the shardblades?

874,"I don't really enjoy fantasy, it's not my thing. LOTR failed to captivate me and I lost interest in GOT fairly early. But just a few days ago I was browsing the r/printsf subreddit, which is dedicated to science fiction literature, and it mentioned Tor was offering a 1000 page book for free, so I tried it. I had two thoughts:

&gt;*Hey, this isn't science fiction*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why is it 3 AM*

It's funny, initially I assumed there was going to be some kind of twist and it would turn out to be science fiction after all (why else recommend it in r/printsf) but now I don't expect nor need that. It's just a damn good story. Won't stop me from picturing the shardplates as high-tech exosuits though! Not sure what the shardblades should be, since they have their weird eye-burning property. I'm representing them in my head as generic energy/plasma/laser swords for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Random thoughts:

* Picturing shardbearers on horses was freakin' weird. Why do horses exist anyway? I don't think there are any other Earth animals on Roshar, except horses and humans.
* The climax was somewhat predictable, but predictable doesn't matter when you're in the heat of the moment, with Bridge Four saving the entire army and the Parshendi shardbearer stepping up to finally face Dalinar.
* The first post-climax reveal at the end I did most definitely NOT see coming, and it only intensified my curiosity for all things Parshendi. Where are they, what are they, how are they, why are they?!
* The second reveal was another bombshell, I absolutely did not expect the old king of Kharbranth to amount to anything. I'm not sure why he wants to assassinate Dalinar, who as I understand it has the same objective: to save the world from whatever approaches.
* Szeth must be under some kind of serious curse as 'Truthless'. If he was not magically bound to his Oathstone, I feel like he would have fled or rebelled long ago. If he is not magically bound, then I'm looking forward to an explanation on why he holds to his rules in the face of horrific abuse.
* There's so much mystery still left surrounding Gavilar's life and why he was assassinated, I can't wait to find out!
* TALN IS BACK 4500 YEARS LATER?! WHAT?! Oh wait his shardblade hasn't turned to mist, that means he's dead now... WHAT?!
* The Wit is without a doubt the best take on a court jester I've ever seen. Having a dedicated insult generator to make the king laugh is such a monarchy thing to do.

&gt;“I’m going to the Honor Chasm,” Kaladin said quietly.

The ability of this book to provoke emotion is beyond me. It's honestly one of the best I've ever read, easily one of my top five. There are so many moments that range from the soul-crushing to the awe-inspiring, but the Honor Chasm really stood out.

I do sorta regret that Kaladin has turned out to have 'superpowers' with his Surgebinding abilities. I feel like the story would be more impactful if he was simply a very skilled spearman determined to find justice in a mad world. But without Surgebinding, he would have probably been killed several times over... I dunno, I'll reserve judgement for now.

877,"Seriously. 
(Sorry for the long post on mobile)

I grew up reading non-stop, meaning I could spend hours flipping through pages of magic and wonder, immersing myself in fantasy lands that to me- were all very real. A good portion of gifts were books, book lights, bookshelves, etc. However as years passed I found myself reading less and less, until it was only for assignments or class work. Reading has become a chore for me, something to do so I could finish my four years and move on. 

This summer I came home from school to save money and left my friends, a job, and my amazing fiancée. I didn’t realize how differently my state (USA) was handling the quarantine until I moved back home. The loneliness was unbearable. Getting a job was near impossible, nothing was open, and everyone I knew was still at college. 

I’ve struggled with serious depression before, and when I felt it start to come back here at home, I got worried. It seemed like there wasn’t any outlet for me, no one to talk to or spend time with, etc. (The big picture is colored differently when you can’t use/feel all your emotions.)

One night while I was talking to my fiancée about how I was feeling, the topic shifted to reading. I expressed my desire to try reading for fun again, and she encouraged me. Well, first she lovingly chastised me for “reading for work”. She knew the bookshelves that lined my room, and the passion I had for reading. But I had developed this mindset of “reading as a tool” and applied it to the books I bought. They were all about self help, mental control and leadership. It was all about what I needed, and nothing that I wanted. 

Accepting the fact that I had given up reading as a pleasure, I decided to start in on the Stormlight Archives. I hadn’t read the third book yet, so I decided to start with the first in the series. 

I hated the first few days. I forced myself to read for at least thirty minutes before giving up. For some reason it seemed to be exhausting! Reading for a length of time was a challenge for me, not a pleasure. Getting into the story seemed rough and bumpy. As I continued, the words started to paint pictures. I started reading more and more, devouring page after page. I finished The Way of Kings a few minutes ago, and I feel amazing. When Kaladin said *those* words, I let out a gleeful laugh (at 3:00 am). 

As I finished reading the last page, I realized something had changed within myself. Likening the characters to myself had allowed me to work through different issues I had. I feel happy, and look forward to what each day brings. I’m not saying this book is a cure for loneliness or depression, but it helped me with mine.",Stormlight_Archive,Reading this book saved me.

Why is that? Is that a little detail or is that, as we all know can happen, Brandon’s foreshadowing for something? Genuinely interested.",Stormlight_Archive,Period cramps and stormlight healing
882,"Was anyone else disappointed with the last act of Oathbringer? I generally like the book and think there is some great stuff in it, but I had a couple of quibbles with it that I didn't have with past Brandon books, especially with the ending. While the epic battle in front of Thelenah is an amazing spectacle and has some great moments, I thought some of the reveals and twists were poorly handled. My main critique comes from the sudden, off-page shift of Amaram from a petty, human level villain (an interesting one) to a cartoon-ish monster corrupted by Odium into a beast. Amaram was much more interesting and complicated when he was a corrupt politician who thought he was doing the right thing but was so caught up in politics that he couldn't see the harm he was causing. He disappears for most of Oathbringer and comes back at the end as a monster that Kaladin can kill without guilt or consequence. Brandon did a similar thing with Sadeas from book one to book two. Sadeas was a cynical jerk in book one who was too caught up in the ""game"" of politics and the silly Alethi war games, but made sense as a human character. In book two he became considerably more cartoon-ish and one-note (much more mustache twirling).

I also did not like how rushed the Adolin/Shallan relationship was. I do not think Shallan was in a healthy mental state at the end of the book and should NOT have gotten married. It's unclear to me if Brandon is aware of this or not (but I'll reserve judgement on this to see if Brandon comes back to this later on). The marriage felt rushed and tacked on and Kaladin's sudden realization that he didn't like Shallan like that after all felt like Brandon changing his mind one book later.

Lastly I have a slight concern that Brandon made Dalinar's crimes a bit too terrible for me to get over what he did so quickly. He burned an entire city to the ground, men, women, children, animals... he burned them all. I'm not sure how we are supposed to feel at the end of the book about Dalinar. I don't think he has truly earned his redemption yet as he spent most of the books so far unaware of what he did, thus unable to truly work to make amends.",Stormlight_Archive,Oathbringer letdowns

We know that the visions include at least the dangers posed by two of the creature that make up Odium's full roster of special nightmare murder bois but somehow they omit the more regular nightmare murder bois, aka the Voidbringers themselves, who make up around 99% of Odium's forces and the danger they represent. It's not like darkeyed children are running around telling each other scary stories about spicy mama Re-Shepir, there's a reason it's the Parshendi everyone remembers. 

From every action and thought Dalinar takes we can be certain Tanavast never so much as mention them. What possible reason could he have not to give a heads up « Oh, by the way, before I go, those marble skin fellas? Cool dudes except don't let them get close to a stormspren or the Apocalypse happens. »  
What's more, couldn't Tanavast have made visions that clearly showed all of the Unmade and other creatures of Odium and their powers/nature. And more to the point, surely the most important information he could have imparted would have concrete details about big O himself. Like, I don't know, the fact that he is a deranged quasi-omnipotent god of hate with a fondness for genocide.

Tanavast focused on creating a sense of urgency in the recipients of his warning but with very little detail. I would argue that time spent talking providing hard information would have been more valuable than most of the events he showed, particularly since he could have collapsed all the battles into a single confrontation where all the actors would be present, Unmade et. all. It's like he was trying to show off his production values by multiplying the instances of people fighting one baddie or another. And if he was bent on capitalising on his VR setup, what about Aharietiam? Or any one other of thousands of incredibly important events he could have chosen?

Finally, all instead of focusing solely on giving out warnings and background information, there is plenty of positive advice he could have shared. Something similar to « Hey guys, there's this really neat trick I'd like to show you. See those shiny flying blue mofos over there? If you bond the right spren you can be shiny too #tamatoastyle. » or « The 7 best ways to bond a spren, number 6 will SHOCK you. ». There's got to be better advice than just repeating Unite them. a dozen times over.

The collection of visions Tanavast does prepare for humanity, instead of containing the most pertinent, urgent information, seems rather to fallback on the old cliché of the vague prophecy that is too abstract or detail-deficient for the characters to figure out until the inevitable mid-series epiphanies start popping up. I know the story would not have worked if Dalinar had had all the information he needed to avoid the Everstorm from the beginning, but what are the in-world reasons for Tanavast to have sent so little actually useful and actionable information?

Thought I would share my plan/spreadsheet in case anyone else has a similar ambition.
893,"I read The Way of Kings before reading Mistborn, but decided to read it again afterwards. Realization of the way the world worked in Mistborn basically allowed me to see or notice things that I had ignored on my first reading. Of course, some of my ideas are going to heavily based on Mistborn, so I expect many to be wrong because this is an entirely different world. 


In Dalinar's last vision, the Almighty mentions that a person called Cultivation can see the future. Cultivation is a very similar name to Preservation and Ruin, which means that Cultivation also has that power. And since the Almighty claims to know Cultivation, he is also a power. Since Odium killed him, Odium must also be a power. The Almighty might be this world's version of Preservation and Odium Ruin. This is only in terms of the role they play in the world and not their actual powers. 


All the characters believe that Shardblades and Shardplate are related, but it doesn't feel that way to me. They're just too different. I'm pretty sure that Shardplate all look the same naturally, but they can be customized to have different colors or accessories. However, each Shardblade is different. The way they interact with their surroundings is also different. Shardblades phase through all living matter, and cut through nonliving matter like water. This means that they are basically unbreakable, except perhaps for other Shardblades. But even so, a Shardblade has never been observed to break. Shardplate, however, interacts normally with living things, and it does break often, though it can recover. In addition, Shardplate is fueled with Stormlight, while Shardblade is different, since it appears to be summoned from mist, and it drips with condensation. Shardplate is always in the real world, while Shardblade appears and dissappears. It's possible that Shardblade comes from Shadesmar. My theory is that Shardplate is of the Almighty, since it is fueled with Stormlight, and Shardblade is of Odium, for reasons I will explain later. 


The epigraphs are really cool in this book. Each part has its own style. The second part's epigraphs seem to be the words of a god of this world and maybe the universe as a whole, perhaps the Almighty. He mentions things outside Roshar, like Ati, the guy who discovered Atium in Mistborn, and someone named Rayne visiting Sel, the world where Elantris takes place. 


The third part's epigraphs are Jasnah's notes on the Radiants and the Voidbringers. I never realized how the descriptions matched the Parshendi on my first read-through. 


The first and fourth part's epigraphs, however, are terrifying. I originally thought they were more of Jasnah's notes but they actually seem to be the words collected from Taravingian's research. I couldn't find any particular pattern in the first part's, but the fourth part's are very interesting. Chapter 54's epigraphs says ""the burdens of mine become mine."" This indicates that these epigraphs are from the perspective of Talenel, the Herald that the others abandoned. He seems to be going insane, but he didn't sound insane in his appearance at the end. Chapter 60 says ""the death is my life, the strength becomes my weakness, the journey hasel ended."" This is like the opposite of the First Ideal of the Radiants. I don't know what it means, but it's very interesting. I have no idea what the first part's epigraphs are, or why these words only come from people who are about to die. The words that Maps said when he died could be referencing how the Plains were Shattered. It could be possible that all these people are seeing visions like the ones Dalinar sees during highstorms. 


I believe that Sigzil mentioned that the Stormfather can also be called Jezrien. In the prelude, we see that Jezrien is one of the Heralds. The king of them, but one of them nonetheless. I don't know what this means, but it's interesting. 


In Mistborn, when the people who controlled the powers of Ruin and Preservation died, the powers themselves remained, and another person was able to claim them for themselves. In Dalinar's final vision, the Almighty says that he is dead. This means that his power is up for grabs. It is possible that, just like the Mists were the manifestation of Preservations power, the highstorms are the manifestations of the Almighty's power, and that chosen individuals could absorb that power. These were probably the Knights Radiant. The distribution of the power was managed by the spren, who would find someone honorable and then give them power. 


Also in Mistborn, Preservation's power was unable to help Vin because she had a Hemalurgical spike, which are of Ruin. Syl mentioned that she hated Dalinar's Shardblade, probably because it is of Odium; however she didn't seem to care about his Shardplate, another reason for me to think that the two are not related. Perhaps this means that with the Shardblade gone, Dalinar will be able to receive the Almighty's power. Szeth is able to use the Almighty's power but also have a Shardblade, however he doesn't have a spren, so he might be a special case made by the Shin priests or something. The Knights Radiant had this power and supposedly used Shardblades, though that might not be true. The prelude states that the Heralds had blades that were more powerful than Shardblades. When Talenel appears at the end, he appears to be carrying a Shardblade when is in actuality carrying one of the special blades. This means that humans cannot differentiate Shardblades and the special blades, so the Radiants might not have actually used Shardblades. This might be a lot of mental gymnastics to support an incorrect theory, as I feel like it's not that much of a distinction, but it's still a possibility. However, the fact that Syl hated Shardblades seems very suspicious to me. 


I think that Dalinar's wife has got to be important somehow. There's no way that the Old Magic just decided to delete her for no reason. She's going to end up being someone important, like Shallan's mom. Im joking about that one, but I'm not joking. 

All the interlude characters confuse me. I'm not as invested in them as with the main characters, and I don't really understand what's happening in many of them, so reading through those chapters is kind of a slog. They're probably setting up important characters or events in later books, but still.

894,"Since there is a timeskip between OB and ROW, there are going to be a lot happened off-screen. My guesses would be:

* A lot of new Radiants coming from being squires. There are lots of new windrunner radiants that's for sure, but i am also curious about how many lightweaver, or edgedancer radiants are going to come from squires. I actually would like to see Gaz becoming a knight radiants and fixing his missing eye. 
* I also expect new orders but i am not confident about this. For example, I'd love to see truthwatchers and stonewards orders already exists etc. 
* I'd like to see formal training routines for windrunners like in skybreaker orders. Maybe also for other orders? 
* Radiants' place in society would be adjusted properly. I remember Sigzil's questions to Kal, I'd like to see how is the hierarchy between radiants and alethi society. 
* More solid coalition. I hope problems are not big within coalition now. 
* Skybreakers are integrated within Singer's army. Honestly this is kind of scary. I'd like to see how Nale function in Singer's army.

On Roshar, symmetry is considered holy, so when I realized that the word Aimia was a symmetrical, I thought it was pretty cool, and it makes sense given how important it's been made out to be.

But that got me thinking, the letters themselves are mostly symmetrical, which only adds to the effect. Depending on how you write your lowercase M's, all of the letters are also entirely symmetrical, except for the last A. However, if you capitalize the last letter too, you get something truly amazing in the amount of symmetry. It is symmetrical, each letter in the word is symmetrical in shape, and therefore the total shape is also symmetrical.

Tolkien Put So Many Songs Into his Books?](https://middle-earth.xenite.org/why-does-j-r-r-tolkien-put-so-many-songs-into-his-books/). The article quotes a quote from a letter written by Tolkien in response to a review of “The Return of the King.” Tolkien wrote:

“Most men make some journeys. Whether long or short, with an errand or simply to go ‘there and back again’, is not of primary importance... For if there is anything in a journey of any length, for me it is this: a deliverance from the plantlike state of helpless passive sufferer, an exercise however small of will, and mobility – and of curiosity, without which a rational mind becomes stultified.”

Even in his letters Tolkien was a wordsmith. Tolkien wrote the original quest and journey with “There and Back Again” and I have a gut feeling he’d have been a strong supporter of Life before Death, Strength before Weakness, and Journey before Destination.

912,"So, while I love much about Shallan and her character arc in the books so far, I have always been bothered at the jokes that Brandon has tried to make with her. Some of them were pretty cringy, even those that others in the series thought were hilarious! My main example is in book I where she talks about discriminating taste in books would give her a stomach ache. These jokes didn't make sense to me, because there were other characters that were written better and it seemed as if Brandon was trying too hard with Shallan.

Till I read Reckoners and saw how BAD David's puns were. For those who haven't read it, they are bad, but I found out the puns were on purpose as part of the character, not a reflection of Brandon.

This got me thinking. Brandon is not trying too hard when writing Shallan, but he wrote beautifully a character that is trying too hard all the time. So much so, that like Jasnah, I cannot stand her sometimes.

Some of the theory's around this is that this is the contest of champions and odium assigns a child to be his. I think it is about Odiums champion but in the past. When Dalinar takes Rathalas he is ordered to kill the heir but instead he spares him as he is just a little kid and lets the mom and kid flee. Later on when the kid is older he rebels and the burning of Rathalas ensues. I think that this referencing the fact that if Dalinar had killed the child he would of never grown up to rebel which lead to the death of Evi and the people of Rathalas, and creating the guilt Dalinar had which almost made him Odiums champion.

Could this imply that Honor actually died by suicide?  Perhaps Honor wasn't Shattered through combat with Odium, but instead Odium used torture or trickery to get Tanavast to Shatter Honor.  Maybe Odium convinced Honor to take an oath that he could not keep, and breaking an oath was so contrary to Honor's nature that it led to the Shattering.

923,"1. Let's get this party started, and we'll tackle the tallest order first! That said, why is Urithiru so storming TALL?! Well, the ancient tome *The Way of Kings* tells the tale of Bajerden, an ancient ruler who reportedly walked all the way to Urithiru. That story is dun as a sphere in the weeping! What he should have written about is how he got back! In the days of the Lost Radiants, from the tippity-top of the tallest tower, there dangled... zip lines! When the Stormfather didn't provide, the leaders of the world would strap on a harness and ride their way home on massive tensile cords! What fun!

2. Recent advancements in ancient linguistics and Veristitalian endeavors have revealed the mind-blowing truth that humans are from another world! WHAT?! Elsecallers would have you believe their version of history - that the people of Roshar traveled through some non-sensical land of darkness and beads and plopped out of a Highstorm. Boring! The truth is that humans arrived on Roshar in a ROCKET SHIP and its name is Urithiru! TO THE STARS, RADIANTS! Or not.

3. There are no mirrors in the entire tower. Not-a-one! Why you ask? Well, the answer may shock you, as it revolves around the very cause of the Recreance! Just like polished mirrors, Shards are shiny and reflective, and most of the Radiants just couldn't stand to look at themselves. Sad!

4. Re-Shephir has danced in every single room in Urithiru. Nude. Yes, even yours.

5. A certain Edgedancer has infamously called attention to the bronze cleavage bursting out of the ancient city of Azimir, but the truth is even racier! Cultivation herself designed this brazen bosom in order to tempt Honor to her side. Not to be upstaged, Honor put on his own display... Schwing!

6. Everyone knows that only a Radiant blade can operate the Oathgates, but you probably didn't know there's a similar lock on the racquet ball courts. Surgebinders only, but no surgebinding allowed! This is one of the few places the Knights can really unwind and let it all hang loose. There's even a sauna!

7. The copper veins in the walls were deliberately designed for communication, but only for a certain few of you. You know who you are! With the surges available to some Radiants, the very walls themselves can tell you their secrets!

8. Somewhere in the tower is a spherical room lined with small gem settings which, when infused with stormlight, spins the walls around like one of those gyroscope dealies. The sole purpose of this room was to spread out spheres of different colors in the settings and trip oouuuuuut on Firemoss and watch the colors. DISCO!!!

9. When Dalinar reignites the tower with his Unity powers it's going to smell real real bad. A place like that has fish, cremlings, and gollums in its bowels. Navani's going to have to invent a destenchifying fabrial real real fast.

10. Urithiru is a giant waterfall. Cusicesh is the Sibling, it dwelt upon the top of Urithiru, and let me tell you, that thing had a BLADDER! The roiling flood spilled down the tiers in a giant majestic waterfall, and the tunnels they found under the tower weren't a secret entrance, they were sewage! Ew!

932,"So i kinda paused reading oathbringer about 800 words in and i decided to re read joe ambercrombie's red country. Anyway this post will contain spoilers for both oathbringer and first law series so yeah 



In Dalinar's flashback chapters we witness the Thrill, a strange state of mind which when activated lets alethi become unstoppable killing machines. The way Dalinar kills dozens if not hundreds of men while in this state really reminded me of when Logen becomes Bloody Nine. This is kinda a fantasy trope but i just found it really similar, and well it made me realise something. With Dalinar we are never shown anything truly despicable, he never does anything too terrible while under the Thrill, but Logen Nine Fingers does, a lot. So if the thrill and bloody nine are so awfully similar that suggests to me that Dalinar must have done some really really terrible things off screen. This just makes me think of him a bit differently. He was a monster just like the Bloody Nine but unlike Logen he seemed to be willing to do all of it, he desired it. If you read first law you know of all the shit Logen did, now imagine Dalinar doing it. Yeah we are told some messed up thing Dalinar did but none of it is described as bloody as what Logen does, simply because the styles of writing are different. But still, just because we don't see Dalinar brutally murdering in the same way the Bloody Nine does doesn't mean he didn't do it. Just reading a scene from ted country where Logen fights those guys in a bar and brutally murders them, with the youngest one only surviving becouse Shy saved him, also reading the part where he brutally murders those raiders after Shy made a deal with them, i imagined Dalinar doing all that and honestly i feel like a younger Dalinar would really do all that. 

Anyway what i wanted to say is that this made me like Dalinar more. It kinda made me respect him more. He started as something similar to Bloody Nine and changed to become a honorable and a good man. This also gave me hope that someone like Logen could change, given the right circumstances.

936,"I just finished a reread of The Way of Kings. There are numerous references to a secret of Shallan's that she keeps hidden only ten heartbeats away, as obvious foreshadowing for the Shardblade reveal. The problem is that Radiant blades can be summoned instantaneously, she doesn't need to wait for the customary ten heartbeats. That's assuming Pattern even is around at this point. 

And while on the subject, when Shallan soulcasts her goblet into blood, that seems to work differently than soulcasting in Words of Radiance. In WOK she talks to a few Cryptics (none of which seemed to be Pattern) and doesn't otherwise interact much with the Cognitive Realm. Is this a one time thing related to her speaking her oath/truth?

Is there a good Word of Brandon about her oaths? We know she's one above Kaladdin, but she seems to speak three truths in the books (I'm afraid / I killed my father / ditto mother) after having had access to her Shardblade as a child.",Stormlight_Archive,Shallan's Heartbeats and other Considerations

He is going to ascend and become the vessel of the Honor shard

Then at the end of Oathbringer when Dalinar summons the Honor's perpendicularity...

You renew spheres, Dalinar? “We are Connected.”

So, I think Dalinar is Connecting somehow with the shard of Honor and he could possibly ascend.

947,On rereading The Way of Kings I found Navani speaking of the pain fabrial where she says she had a hand in its construction in chapter 60. The spren inside it... what type of spren is it?  Is it of Odium? Taking someone’s pain sounds very familiar and 2 books from now this might be a point we look at as a big foreshadowing moment. She goes on to say “If you could see the things we have planned for the future.”  This really sounds like Odium or possibly The Diagram. Could Odium or Taravangian be manipulating Navani?,Stormlight_Archive,Are we being set up for a massive swerve?
948,"In Oathbringer there's a scene where Navani looks over some notes and it describes plans for a ship with a strange design. The sails are on the bottom. This seems strange until you realize what she's up to. Navani is a scholar. She is an engineer. She designs fabrials and learns as she goes. The advent of Kaladin as a Windrunner and Szeth in his attacks shows Navani what is possible, and I believe that in RoW we will see Urithiru with a fully functional airship.

Bonus theory - Rysn's ship will crash and at her low, Navani will somehow find her shipwreck, fix it up, and Wandersail will become an airship capable of traversing the highstorms, just like in the legends.",Stormlight_Archive,Theory - Navani's Secret Weapon
949,"
Basically the honor blades. 

They will collect all of them and melt them down and reforge into one new blade effectively making dalinar honor.

Odium will be playing the herald's thinking that is in his favour to kill them and harness their power into a weapon say a shard dagger that Moash uses to be the champion of nine shadows. 

Then the great redemption as kaladin saves Moash while swearing the final ideal!

Wtf is this😂 this is probably some clever math thing someones worked out.

Ooh it really is like proper Indiana Jones vibes eh.

Whys it odd Renarin leaned against the wall? It makes sense cus there might've been a trap in there for all he knew.

You know what, i can totally imagine this sense of wonder. It's what i get when i go caving and i come into a big open chamber. A sense of awe and seeing something few people might've seen before. Its an incredible feeling.

All this stone makes me think of the Shin. Could they have something to do with this? They're certainly aware of Urithiru and haven't told anyone else on Roshar!

Its the blades! The blades are the key. And lots of them have one. But would they need an honorblade instead maybe?

Woah. Wtf is this second storm eh. They're only summoning the everstorm and there cant be a highstorm now. Wow, shit really is about to go down.

Damn so close! They gotta figure this out surely.

Woo come on Adolin, do what you do best and win the duel!

Hang on, why does she have the thrill if the Alethi don't? Hmm.

Uh oh, its definitely building a lot more.

Yikes, he's, uh, really not winning this atm is he.

Ooh hello, he's distracting her. But for what?

Pfft. Destroyer?! Theyre, literally slaughtering the Alethi right now! Both just as bad as eachother. Honestly!

Ah! Thats what the distraction was for😂. I reckon she might've somehow survived. Maybe. She can't be gone that quick, surely.

Yay for bridge four!!

Ah fuck. He's here again.

Well that was over quickly😂😬 but i suspect Kal isn't finished yet.

I'm getting major Palpatine and Anakin vibes here even though its not really the same😂😂

Stormfather, is that Syl? 

He's realising the words again. Maybe there's a chance she could come back if she isn't dead!

Yess Kaladin. Don't let them have him!

This is why the stormfather left Dalinar behind! This is the child he needed to sort out! I said it could be syl. She always did have a defiant streak in her.

Yess lad! A radiant once more. And he's grown. Good for him. 

My goodnes what an epic image. Just a burst of pure light. And now he has his own shardblade too!

Fuck! He was working for Taravangian the entire time. He wanted Kaladin to focus on Elhokar so they could kill Dalinar. And their plan might just work. For all i know Oathbringer only has Dalinar as a flashback character. Ahhhh I'm worried! But Kaladin has now said 3 levels of words if i am correct. So he should theoretically be a more powerful radianr than before. Plus he has a fucking shardblade now.

Ooof Moash scurrying away. I suspect we won't see more until Oathbringer. And he's gonna return with a vengeance.

85

The wanderer, is that Hoid? And we now know that Mraize and the ghostbloods are clearly a known quantity to Taravangian. Do they have similar aims since both want to prevent the return of the radiants?

Well things are really starting to take off😉. I'll see myself out😂😂

Ooh will Dalinar confront him again and will Kal save the day?!!

All in the dawnchant eh. I don't remember much about that.

What the fuck is up with him?! Seeing the future? And all these zeros? Is he having a spasm or what?

No, no no no no NO! Don't you dare do a fucking death speech Dalinar. Don't make me cry dammit. 
You may have had an bad past but you are making up for it and that's what counts.

A stormwall. Eek. This is really getting dangerous.

Well i suppose he has to confront him for his brother. Get his vengeance for his brother's honour.

Ooh honorblade vs honorblade. I just realised this and I like it.

Wow. What an emotional moment. Even if he doesn't manage to survive, he's let go of the past and the burden he chose.

Fuck its Roion. That was unexpected!

Well at least he died with honour. Rest in peace Roion.

Why the fuck does his shardblade hiss?!

Fuck. Black sky. This really is starting to culminate.

Ooh a charge led by Adolin. This sorta feels like an avengers kinda team up charge but with bridge four.

Fuck, not Dalinar.

Don't be stupid Adolin. Your father didn't die so you could die straight away too.

Storms, how did he survive?.

Yes Kaladin. Claim those fucking skies. Come on lad!!

86

A traitor eh. Is this referring to one of the radiant orders or something else like spren?

Are they lashing themselves to the sky though? Or are they just lashing themselves upwards? Cus the sky isn't really a tangible physical thing that can block them from going further into the atmosphere right? Unless I'm totally wrong on the mechanics😂

So many bridgemen we don't know the name of until they die! Is it meant to be more emotional? Cus i don't really have a connection to them just from a name I've only heard because they died. Or was mentioned briefly before.

Ooh here we go. The true blade against blade fight.

Seriously what is up with Renarin? He's being fucking weird like.

Of course its a fabrial! So how do they get it to work then?!

I'm glad they've FINALLY found out he's a radiant. Should make things a little easier now.

Fuck, that horse is good. Go Gallant!

Sebarial just casually drinking wine😂😂 i really dont understand him. He's a good guy but i wanna know what his motives are. I don't fully understand him yet, but i like him.

Poor Aladar. Must be pretty crushing to go from a sense of victory to a sense of ' fuck, the journey has just begun and its an unstoppable force'😂😬

Go on Dalinar. Get your salvation!

Woah hang on. The shardblade disappears and then Syl pops out? What's up with that? Do the spren get trapped in the blade? Is that why they scream?

Ahhh. Good for the clarification about the storms. I remember he said to Dalinar now earlier that he'd send one! Kinda like the great flood eh! Lets hope the stormfather promises never to send one again😂

Woah woah woah. Syl BECAME the blade? So the blades are Spren? But then how do the non radiants use the blades?

And now some of the blades are dead spren awakened every time they're called back? I need more explanation of the mechanics and how spren can bond with just anyone because not everyone will be a radiant who carries a blade. Surely?

This is just like that knife Shallan had when carving in the chasms! How the fuck did i not see all these little clues and work it out?! The pattern on the side..it was pattern the entire time. She's had pattern as a blade since she was a kid. Wow. Is that how her mother was killed? Why they talk about her soul being in a box?

Wow. Szeth is pretty intense eh. I guess being confronted with the horrors you caused because you were convicted of lying but were then proved right does that to ya! Just how did Szeth know though?

I feel like this is an Iron Man 1 moment. Everyone realizes superheroes aka radiants are a real thing.

Fuck knows what Renarin is up to.

😂 Adolin finding out about Shallan lol.

Impending doom. Yikes!

Aharietiam. The desolations return. 

I'm getting major WoT book too vibes here. No spoilers but if ya know, ya know😉. On book four currently if anyone wants to know!

All i can say here is this is fucking epic. Syl just instantly transforming, so at one with eachother now. I wonder if this transformation of the blade is an ability Kaladin always had, or one granted by the next level of words that he said.

Hang on. Where the fuck did this come from?! A plateau out of nowhere? What did Szeth summon it or something?!

Aww no fair! You can't just run away like that!

Don't worry about that Shallan! Worry about what tou can do now to save the rest!

All the other blades are dead ones. Not bonded to a radiant. Thats why hers works. I wonder what where Shallan would go if she didn't get to Urithiru but one of the other exit points.

Yayy Urithiru!

I'm getting kinda lost here but I'll just go with the ride 😂

Ooh an end. Here we go.

Well he's dead. Or is he. And now we have two honorblades. Pretty epic but i was kinda expecting more revelations. A good ending but i think WoK has topped it for me.

957,"Hi,
Idk how other people feel about this, but for me it seems in the Stormlight archive missing a lot of communication. I know a lot of characters in the books like to hold things back and not share everything. it happened in Mistborn too but less frequent. For example in Mistborn, we knew that Vin didnt share the duraluminum use for a while and then found out that she shared some of her knowledge with Elend. 

In Stormlight books Kaladin and Shallan are both quiet secretive in nature. In the end of Word of Radiance we see the knights radiants have been reformed and later on we see that they have shared some of their knowledge and other times not. I cannot help but to think how much they actually shared with each other and how much they left out. It kinda left me wondering when going through Oathbringer is that how much they actually know about each other experiences becoming radiants. 
Idk if I’m putting it correctly but i felt I’m missing something there even after my reread of the Stormlight books.

Recently, i started reading the Wheel of Time. On 3rd book atm. And i noticed I always know what they mentioned to others and what they decided to keep as a secret and that reminded me of the Stormlight, there are a lot of communication missing especially at the end of Word of Radiance and through Oathbringer.

So I've been re-reading Stormlight yet again, (or rather listening to the graphic audio) and I'm currently at the scene where Shallan scares off the Midnight mother. It is mentioned that only Shallan and Renarin seem to sense the wrongness, or at least that Dalinar cant. I'm wondering if maybe they can sense because they share the illumination surge? (which Re-sephir seems to be attempting to copy, or is a twisted version) Which made me think, 

What if each of the unmade related to an order of radiant? Somehow the Midnight Mother was a twisted version of the illumination surge? Or of lightweavers? I was thinking I should go through the orders and try to match them to unmade but we really don't have enough information about either atm. There are 10 orders, and its rumored that there are 10 unmade. Brandon isn't one for coincidence.

Personally I think it might be along the lines of “Sometimes I must kill even those that I love, as long as it is right”

This theory of mine ties in with several examples. Kaladin has not yet been able to swear the next ideal, and it would make sense if it was along these lines because he is so devoted to those that he loved and/or befriends. He was traumatized when his friends were killing his other friends and he couldn’t cope with it, just like he can’t cope with the 4th ideal yet (I’m referring to when his wall guard friends were fighting with his parsh friends in Kholinar). AND his ideal that was most recent was that he would protect even those that he hated as long as it was right. So wouldn’t it provide a great symmetry if the inverse of that was also true?

967,"So about the sibling. I’ve seen long forum threads about this where people discussed their ideas, but a common topic was that the sibling is related to stone. How do we know this? I just finished re-reading the series for the 7th or 8th time (and still found things I missed, which is what I totally love about Sanderson), but I didn’t notice the reference to this. Granted there are certain chapters that I tend to skip ever since my 3rd or 4th re-reading.

My personal thought was that it would be SO cool if Maya (Adolin’s deadeye shardblade spren) might possibly be the sibling, since she seems to have more awareness than any other deadeye, and is able to do things that other deadeyes cannot (like in the final battle in Oathbringer when she is able to be summoned in 7 heartbeats instead of the normal 10 for a “dead” shardblade.

But once I started reading threads about how the sibling is related to stone, my theory started to not make as much sense. Maya is most likely an edge dancer high spren from what I remember. So where is this “stone” reference that people are using for their Sibling theories?

Kaladin’s vision in Oathbringer in Riino’s lighthouse showed Odium’s champion coming for Dalinar. We know Taravangian wants to save as much of Roshar as possible, which could theoretically be portrayed as the 10 silver kingdoms (Jah Keved +9 others, giving meaning to the 9 shadows). He has also been shown to actively work against Dalinar throughout.

It could be that somehow Cultivation has been working through Taravangian playing a long game to defeat Odium? She is manipulating him through the Diagram. Odium thinks he is picking a great champion, but Cultivation has given him a flaw that will ensure he loses (I can’t remember if Odium knows of T’s boon/curse situation).

979,"I never gave the matter much thought before, aware the different characters' chapters were arranged in broad chronological order, but not perfectly so. I am rereading Words of Radiance though, and 400 pages each Szeth pops in to do a wee bit of murdering. That's 400 pages after we see him at the end of The Way of Kings and there's no reason to think he's had to run any other errands between Taravangian ordering him to wack Dalinar and attacking the Pinnacle. That has me thinking that maybe all the different arcs and POVs are way less simultaneous than I thought. 

Just before this chapter Shallan learns about the murder of of her king, and that's Szeth's second to last chapter in TWOK. I know she doesn't exactly have a 5G connection and a subscription to the online The New Kholinar Times, but that's still a hug time lapse for he learn about it, unless the Szeth chapters in TWOK are actually ahead of their time. 

That has me wondering about other things. Maybe when Szeth attacks the Pinnacle for the first time, when the Stormfather and Syl warn Kaladin about Odium coming, they actually are referring to Eshonai transforming, even though that chapter of hers only comes later on. That sounds plausible because Odium is not behind Szeth and would very much like to keep Dalinar alive.",Stormlight_Archive,How Chronological are the Chapters?
981,"This dawned on me today  when i was thinking about shardplate, its kind of useless. While yes it enhances a persons strength and gives them mega protection but thats only needed if your fighting something like a shardblade. It also seems to work against help from other radiants as well. In Dalinars vision the radiant said the plate had to be off so they could lash them seems a little counter productive? In modern times its very important but the radiants arent fighting each other they are fighting the fused. And the fused have no weapon that we have seen that is on the level of a shardblade. We can also see the a radiant can kill a thunderclast without plate (Renarin), so thats another no. I dont think the real purpose of shardplate is armour but a capsule for stormlight. Human bodies are shown to be really bad holders of stormlight and on a battle every sphere counts. So the real purpose of the plate is to make it so stormlight lasts longer and maybe even holds it. In Dalinars vision the radiants sharplate glows and the modern dead radiant plate hasnt done that.

**Prologue:**

*""Gavilar himself stood pointing at something on a table, surrounded by five others: two officers, two women in long dresses, and one old man in robes.""*

1\. Who are they? Are Navani and Amaram two of them?

**Chapter 10: Distractions:**

*""Of the five eyewitnesses,"" the ardent said, ""four, um, independently counted the number of attackers at...fifty or so?""*

2\. What of the fifth? Seems intentional to say four.

**Chapter 13: Squires Can't Capture:**

*""They looked different from what he expected. For one thing, their skin was a different shade—many parshmen here in Alethkar had marbled white and red skin, rather than the 
deep red on black like Rlain from Bridge Four. They didn’t wear warform, though neither did they wear some terrible, powerful form. Though they were squat and bulky, their only carapace ran along the sides of their forearms and jutted out at their temples, leaving them with full heads of hair.""*

3\. What is this form they are in? Is this like humanform or something?

4\. And what is the significance of Brandon describing specifically the the color of marbling on every parshmen we meet in the series? It's obviously intentional.

**Chapter 16: Wrapped Three Times:**

*""What will you do with it? the Stormfather asked as Dalinar entered theempty corridors. It is a weapon beyond parallel. The gift of a god. With it, youwould be a Windrunner unoathed. And more. More that men do notunderstand, and cannot. Like a Herald, nearly.""*

5\. How is it more than a normal windrunner but less than a herald? I thought the only powers the Heralds had came from their honorblades.

*""I found my master's master's master in Kholinar after we captured it,""*

6\. How is it that the Kholin's did not always have Kholinar? Is it not named after them? ",Stormlight_Archive,Random Oathbringer Questions

1028,"Now I am probably sure people have fiddled with this idea for quite some time but as i was rereading OB and started looking into how exactly Odium kill the other shards i noticed how (as far as we know) different honor's death is with the others (Ambition, dominion etc). Now I don't think you can remove a shard just outright from the cosmere, previously Odium has had to do something with the shard itself when he kills the host (like confining Dor within the cognitive). Now unlike that, when Odium killed Honor (as far as i know) he didn't confine the Honor shard anywhere. So in essence, the honor shard was shattered (into i assume the Stormfather and other honorspren). 

Now Tanavast is dead. We know this. But Honor still remains on Roshar. I think that whole champion bit is a red herring, i dont see any way Odium just agrees to a battle of champions (why would he, it makes no conceivable sense). Now (and this may just be my brain trying to avoid writing my UCSF application) i believe that a vessel on Roshar will exude Honor to such an event in the climax of the 5th book that he attracts most if not all Honorspren to himself thereby reforming the shard. Now I do not think it will be Dalinar (as much as i love the characters), i dont think he embodies Honor. I know I know, the basically brought forth the Honor perpendicularity but excluding that, has he ever shown feats of honor? Even before Stormfather/Tanavast chose him to be a bondsmith, he didnt attract an honorspren (or any other type of spren). He also seems to obvious a choice. I think it would be Kaladin (stormfather did call him the Child of Tanavast). Now unlike Dalinar, Kaladin literally found the order of Windrunners by himself. He didn't just group together a bunch of honorific people and voila, Windrunners. He turned literal criminals and murderers into Windrunners (or future ones). If that isn't the biggest flex of Honor i dont know what is. And this might just be a very untrue theory but i think the way Kaladin is going and his inner turmoil is, i believe one of his future ideals (imo the 5th one) will be akin to something along the lines of ""I will protect everyone, except Him and his people"" (im not one for those philosophical honor lines but you get what i mean). His last ideal will bring harmony (geddit) to his internal turmoil, giving him purpose. He will swear to protect everyone except those that serve him (thus get f-ed fused and Odium). And i can see him swearing that ideal, and charging Odium and finally Odium will face another Shard that is also a warrior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know this has some plotholes (im not one of those theorists, im just a procrastinator) but i just felt like this was a viewpoint that could be talked about (honestly it could also be Dalinar idk, i just dont see Dalinar embodying Honor with everything he has done).",Stormlight_Archive,Honor's Revival

1033,"The Unmade

For reference, I am on a reread of Oathrbringer. I have just finished the chapter ""The Revelry"" where Shallan goes to the Kholinar Oathgate for recon and Kaladin kills one of the Fused during a raid on the wall guard. I think much of the lore/history behind the Heralds &amp; Unmade went over my head the first time around, so I'm looking for some clarification. 

I understand that the Unmade are very powerful Spren: dark, cognitive shadows allied with Odium &amp; the Voidbringers, but what exactly are they? 

 I understand that they are basically ""shards"" of Odium, and influence humanity across Roshar in different ways. It seems like they are corrupted, or backwards versions of the Herald's powers and ideals/defining attributes. 

Are they the Herald's 7500 years of pain &amp; suffering manifest as cognitive shadows? This would be consistent, as the Nighwatcher is the cognitive shadow of Cultivation (I think), and the Stormfather is the cognitive shadow of Honor. 

For example, Re-Shepir is a direct mirror of lightweaving and Shalash's abilities. I'm still trying to figure out what the other Unmade are aligned with, but Naergal (The Thrill) could be a corrupted version of Chanarach's bravery. Ashertmarn (The Heart of the Revel)'s promotion of excess could be an opposite of Battar's wisdom. Sja-Anat, and her ability to corrupt Spren may be a corruption of Vedel's loving/healing and Bo-Ado Mishram providing the Fused with voidlight is a reflection of Paliah's giving attribute. 

When the Heralds broke the Oathpact, they did so to essentially ""give up their pain,"" similarly to how Odium tempts Dalinar, Shallan, etc. This would also explain why there are only 9 Unmade, as Taln never gave his up. In a way, they would have received a boon and curse, much like the Nightwatcher. Their boon would be to give up the responsibility of the Oathpact, and their curse would be that while they no longer stuck in the cycle of Desolations, they are still cursed with their own madness, guilt, and seeming immortality. 

After writing this post, it inspired one other thought. Could the Sibling be the cognitive shadow of Taln? It is known that the Sibling is connected to Urithiru and the tower city appears to have been created by Stonewards (Taln's order). I'm guessing that the Unmade were ""made"" over time during the 7500 years of the Heralds torture, then were ""unmade"" when the Heralds broke their oaths. I'm theorizing that The Sibling is a ""wrong"" (not in a bad way) version of Taln's ideals. His continued experience of torture and never breaking is what caused the cycle of Desolations to end (until now). The Sibling could be the opposite of his affinity for war, making it the Spren of Peace. Thoughts?",Stormlight_Archive,(Spoilers for Oathbringer) A Question/Theory about the U*****

However,  there's much more that I'm seeing that make up strength of squires:

2. Oath 2 Skybreaker squires aren't even officially squires until this oath yet. They don't bond a highspren yet, either. Oath 2 Windrunners can bond an honorspren and surgebind independently from their Knight under whom they squired.

Something I noticed about Vatha is that he's not even Oath 1 but uses illumination.  Shallan said that perhaps most proto Lightweavers could do the same before saying the oaths (similar to what Kaladin was doing in WoK, too). So I'm not sure if he's a proto Lightweaver or if all Lightweaver squires can use illumination without even saying Oath 1.

* Ishikk steps around in the lake carefully so as to not step on a sharp lip of rock. Doesn't the moving water of the lake erodes the sharp rocks and make them plan-err? It is written the water in Pure lake moves but slowly.
* The guy Thaspic who was Ishikk talking to lost a shirt in the lake while washing it. And both thought it was completely normal how it's supposed to be. Ishikk said, ""Ah, that's the way of things.""
* And finally, Purelake drains itself before a Highstorm. Now, this can be more of a, I don't know, Highstorm thing, but it seemed weird to me.

Could it be, and bear with me, can the Purelake be the third sibling. In Oathbringer it looked like Stormfather knew where the sibling is hiding, he cut Dalinar off before he can question more.

I know it probably a wack theory. But we all know Brandon always does more than one stuff in an Interlude. I am sure this Interlude was not just about telling the reader that some guys are searching for Hoid.

1066,"I'm definitely not the first person to notice or talk about this, but I just had a realization about the relation of the humans to the singers and Roshar.  Obviously  the humans came in and enslaved the singers. That much is explicitly stated.  There are also fairly overt references to perceived superiority and religious motivation in terms of justification. What I thought was especially poignant and relevant to today was the way we find out about this.

Throughout the majority of the books, the humans think of themselves as the rightful inhabitants of the world. When the audience and the characters discover that humans actually colonized the planet and were refugees of another world, it is a major shock. I think this can be read as a mirror to today's (sort of) post colonial powers and their inhabitants coming to grips with the reality that they got heir homes by devastating technologically inferior peoples and cultures: slavery, genocide, systematic removal of religion, and continued oppression centuries later.

Someone a lot smarter than me could probably find more meaning and specific parallels, so I'll leave it there.

It will be interesting to see how this is dealt with in Rhythm of War.

1078,"Hey everyone!

So this is it... I'm all caught up with the Cosmere! I'm so glad I embarked on this journey with Mistborn three months ago.

Spoilers for the Cosmere as a whole are fair game in this post. Anyway to Oathbringer!

Oathbringer was my favourite Stormlight Book, just ahead of Way of Kings. It has a few pacing issues but other than that, I found it absolutely stellar and reinforces my opinion that Stormlight is definitely Brandon's best work so far, but also some of the best in fantasy right now, perhaps even the best. If he keeps writing at this level, Stormlight will definitely go down in history of the fantasy genre as one of the all time great.

The character work on Dalinar was just stunning and finally closing his character arc that started back in WoK was so satisfying, though I'm sure he'll have a new interesting one pretty soon. Dalinar's story in Oathbringer truly resonated with me for several personal reasons and I honestly found myself shedding tears at some point, especially when he finds that ""The most important step a man can take is the next one"". This brought me to tears because I needed to hear this. Through Dalinar's character arc I found help to some of the struggles I've been facing these past few years and it was just incredible. 

I loved Shallan in this book, and I'm glad we had some Adolin POV too. Really enjoyed all of Bridge Four characters, including my man Kaladin, though I truly wish that at some point the dude allows himself to feel some form of happiness 😅. He deserves it!

I don't want to write a lengthy review but honestly Oathbringer is a 9.5/10. I just loved it through and through and I can't wait for Rythm of War in November.

Also now that I'm done with the Cosmere I can finally start reading theories and 17th shard for information and to clear up things I misunderstood so that's pretty awesome.

Having Vivenna, Vasher and Nightblood show up was so freaking cool. I loved the idea of the Cosmere because of this crossover potential and now that one has happened on this scale (and I'm sure we'll see more in the future) I'm so hyped for what comes next for this incredible universe that Brandon is building. 

Thanks for reading this, and I'll be down in the comments 😁

1111,"Name: Preystalkers

Oaths: 1) life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.
    2) I will respect those I kill, acting not with hatred but with determination
    3) I will kill only when I must but will do so without hesitation
    4) oath of individuality/independence: this oath is specific to each knight and can be anything their spren deems adequate for their growth (some knights even rarely swear an oath from another order) 
    5) oath of apprenticeship: with this oath the knight swears to take an apprentice (squire), notably they only take one “squire” at a time, and their apprentice only “graduates” after swearing the 3rd oath after which they search for their 4th oath.

Surges: This order has access to the surges of gravitation and transportation. Using their surges they can consume a rather large amount of stormlight to temporarily give their spren much more substantial forms in the physical realm and even allow their spren to use the surge of gravitation to a very limited degree. It’s also notable that their spren can go further from them without losing sapience, although they will still lose their access to surges from the same distance as other knights.

Traits: members of this order are known for their extreme determination and resourcefulness, thinking on their feet, and changing tactics on the fly. They are often criticized by other orders for their lacking communication skills, and seemingly erratic actions. Another strange quirk of their members is that they often got along better with spren than with men, and when working with other knights (even within their own order) they often opt to talk to the spren instead of the knights bonded to them. This habit again could form rifts with other knights and branded them as frustrating or difficult to work with. Interestingly this order was known for having many members who lived primarily in the cognitive realm. The order also was the most frequent world hoppers and consequently contained the most members that were not born on Roshar although it was still quite uncommon. 

Use of powers: Their surges give them the most freedom of travel compared to other orders, and they use this to full advantage, allowing them to chase their prey to even the cognitive realm (or to other worlds) and escape tight situations in the physical realm. As previously mentioned they can use stormlight to give their spren more substantial forms and even perform small amounts of surgebinding (this is similar to abilities that the lightweavers are known to do with their spren, but simply with gravitation instead of Illumination). Although this ability is extremely useful it consumes stormlight very fast, and so must be used very carefully. They are also known for creative uses of their shardblades often shaping them in very interesting ways.

Role within orders: this order is relative to other orders quite small,and is often sent on long distance and assassination missions often taking a “bounty hunter” role. Although they often work alone there are notable exceptions. When swearing the 4th oath a small amount of this order swears the oath of another order and becomes a “permanent squire” to a knight of that order.

1114,"A thought had suddenly occurred to me and I can't help but think it would be Shallan who would draw out of Hoid about the *Truths* of his identity. Of course, being a Lightweaver now, I think Hoid would be forced to confess his Truths in order to ascend into a higher Ideal. If this scene I am imagining were to true, I think it would bring Hoid to the 4th Ideal at the minimum.

From a logical standpoint, it would be much convenient for Hoid if he just confessed to his Cryptic about himself and he might even rig the rules of the Nahel Bond. But, from a narrative standpoint, it would also make sense for Hoid to confess his deep-seated Truths to Shallan whom, even in such a short time, he had built a degree of attachment with.

And so, either way, I wonder. What would Hoid confess? Would he say that he was one with the people who Shattered a god? Would he maybe confess his role to Adonalsium's Shattering? Or maybe Hoid was actually the key to reaching Adonalsium prior to his Shattering? Maybe in doing so, he had carried over the burden of regret and maybe why he is now (as far as I know) collecting every Investiture of every Shard?

These are all just speculations, and like all speculations, are subject to being far-fetched. Maybe Hoid won't even need to ascend the Bond. Maybe he just needed the Investiture alone. But, if it does happen and if Hoid indeed were to tell his Truths, I think it'd make for a beautiful narrative.",Stormlight_Archive,[Cosmere Spoiler] Revelations of Truth

1127,"Added some spoiler tags in case anyone who has only read WoK, and not the whole series and/or Mistborn, decide to click this thread.

I have consumed everything Mistborn plus Warbreaker, and have now started this. As the title suggests I'm only 25% through, just finished chapter 17 to be exact and am a first time reader (so please no spoilers after this point), but this chapter made me realize a whole bunch of things and I have so many thoughts I just need to share. Not sure if anyone cares but I just feel like writing this down! Maybe you will find my theories entertaining.

I thought the book initially to be a bit slow, mostly because of the many alternating POVs when you don't have a relationship to those characters yet. However, I quickly took a liking to Kaladin, probably because he reminds me of Kelsier in a lot of ways (the determination, rebellious nature and fierce protection of others), and Kelsier is one of my favourite cosmere characters. I am also loving Syl and very curious as to what exactly she is and what's happening to her. I'm somewhat interested in where the plotlines of Shallan and Dalinar/Adolin are going, but I'm not so attached to them as characters yet, not like I already am to Kaladin.

Anyways, I'm a sucker for the ""magic is very special and only a few know how to or can use it"" trope (you can see my previous post on r/Fantasy about it), and especially when the main character is or becomes one of those people. Needless to say I was kinda sad none of the main characters seemed to practice any magic, and that magic in general was quite absent apart from Shardblades and Soulcasting (which isn't super interesting to me, not compared to something like Allomancy with loads of different powers). I was hoping one of them would eventually come across what Szeth seemed to be doing in the prologue, and I really wanted Kaladin to become our magic-guy. I like him a lot and he definitely deserves it, also because it would just really fit his character so well.

Lo and behold, he receives his payment spheres from Gaz, and sucks them dry accidentally in this chapter without knowing during practice and the bridge run. When Gaz said they were newly infused it just clicked for me, and I have never felt so excited! It explains his random bursts of strength during practice and the run, why he always survives and seems to deflect arrows, and also in his very first chapter where he is referred to as ""lucky"" and Cenn sees a moving aura around him. It hasn't been confirmed but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I am so beyond excited for him to find out about it, and learn more about the magic system along with myself.

Not only that, the interlude after [Secret History] &gt;!talks about Ati?! Hello Ruin?? I didn't expect direct connections so fast! I absolutely love it! This must mean the person talking during these interludes is either one of or related to the 16 people who took up Shards, as was explained in SH, and he must be talking to one of the others due to the receiver being described as ""immortal""!&lt;. There is also the interlude ""Three of sixteen ruled, but now the Broken One reigns"", which I take to mean there are [SH] &gt;!*three* Shards on Roshar, or at least were!&lt;, and I am thinking the Broken One could be [future Stormlight] &gt;!Odium!&lt;? I only know this name because I've seen others mention it, but all I know about it is that it's a &gt;!Shard!&lt;.

1136,"I was rereading Words of Radiance and found it being inconsistent with the plot of Edgedancer.

In edgedancer, both Nin and Szeth are present and the main part of the plot is that Nin believes that Voidbringers haven't returned yet.

However, in WoR chapter 88, Nin meets Szeth for the first time and Szeth claims Voidbringers returned. It felt like Nin implied that he was aware that Voidbringers returned.

Though, during the first discussion with Szeth at no point Nin explicitly agreed to and it can be argued that he is simply insane or that he was just saying what Szeth needed to hear so Nin could promote hisown agenda.

1143,"I dont think some of the Heralds match their Order, and that the Orders themselves dont match their purpose. Let me explain.

* Skybreackers seek justice, and their Herald is Nale, Herald of Justice. Fair enough. But wouldnt it make more sence for the Truthwatchers to be the Order of Justice? After all, who is better to enforce laws and judge criminals than one that seeks truth?
* Skybreackers fly, basically. And their Herald is Jezrien, King of Heralds, Herald of Leadership. Wouldnt the Bondsmiths be more addecuate for him? After all, it is a leaders duty to unite people.
* Elsecallers and their Herald Battar. Elsecallers can travel to and from Shadesmar (Not as simple as that, I know) and Soulcast. Kalak is just the perfect Herald for this Order. He can also travel to and from Shadesmar, and is the Herald of craftsmanship. While Battar can also do this, (plus full on soulcasting), she is described as wise and knowledgable, perhaps being more suited for another Order.

1144,"In preparation for Tuesday's release of The Way of Kings (Prime), an unpublished 2002-2003 era draft of The Way of Kings, we are announcing a new post spoiler flair.

##""Unpublished"" flair

/r/stormlight_archive has a new flair, ""Unpublished"". This flair is to be used for all unpublished works --- The Way of Kings Prime, the unpublished white sands novel, the unpublished chapters from Dragonsteel Prime, etc. It does *not* apply to pre-release chapters of stormlight novels posted on Tor's website. 

##How to use the new flair

""Unpublished"" is *inclusive of* ""Cosmere"". 

What that means is that in a post marked with the ""Unpublished"" flair, full Cosmere spoilers are allowed without spoiler guards. Because ""Unpublished"" indicates a discussion of an unpublished, non-canon work, we assume that people interested in reading and talking about it are sufficiently Cosmere aware that it is reasonable to hierarchically order the categories in this way. :)

This also means that in a post marked with the ""Cosmere"" flair or the flair for ""any published Stormlight Archive book*, we expect content from The Way of Kings Prime to be spoiler guarded. 

As always, we'd love to hear your feedback about this, either in a comment here or in a message to the moderators.",Stormlight_Archive,"Announcement: Additional New Spoiler Flair for Posts (""Unpublished"")"
1146,"There are many reasons people don't like Shallan. Some think she's annoying. Some think her story is boring. One complaint in particular comes up a lot: Shallan's story, especially in TWoK, is hardly important for most of it's duration. It feels like a B plot. While the other main characters are in the middle of the action and have great effect over the world around them, she sits around doing mostly nothing. She has almost no agency.
I've heard replies to this argument, too. Shallan has a lot of agency - she risked everything she had to save her home, and did so much to try and make sure she succeeded. She doesn't just sit in a library, she struggles to save her family. And while all of that is true, I want to offer a different argument from a different perspective. I'll be discussing Shallan's role in TWoK in particular, because its the part people are most upset with.
In TWoK there are three main characters: Shallan, Kaladin and Dalinar. Kaladin and Dalinar, as noted before, take part in a lot of action. They're leaders and fighters. They create social and political changes. They're placed at the political heart of a powerful nation, surrounded by it's most influential members. They are the start of something new and great. Shallan, on the other hand, is a scholar. She spends most her days in a library, trying to find an answer to forgotten questions.
Something I always found fascinating in the stormlight archive series is the gender roles. In our world's past, women were responsible for the household and the children, and men had control over most other things. In Alethi culture the gender roles are much more interesting. Men are leaders, fighters and politicians (with some exceptions, most important Alethi politicians are men). Women, on the other hand, control knowledge. Men give orders, women can read. It creates an interesting power balance, because in a way they're almost equal - both leadership and knowledge are great powers in their own rights. Just think about it - in this culture, most men don't have access to books. They don't know how to read and write! Imegaine what advantage that gives to women. On the other hand, women aren't taught how to fight and protect themselves. They don't lead armies, and they don't make desicions for nations and kingdoms. That's a huge advantage for men.
Fittingly, Kaladin and Dalinar are leaders, and Shallan is a scholar. Kaladin and Dalinar fight on the battlefield, Shallan studies in the library.
I don't mean to say that ""Shallan is a women, she's restricted and doing what her role allows her"". That isn't my argument. My argument is that the great changes happening in this series aren't only moved by people like Kaladin and Dalinar but by people like Shallan as well. Both parties are crucial for the plot. Shallan's field of work may involve less action, but in this world, in this story, it is of high importance. Kaladin and Dalinar move mountains. She, together with Jasnah, does too. They're just different, less action packed mountains.
As I said, I think both knowledge and political power are important in this story. I also think it's this way on purpose - I think Brandon wanted both of them to be crucial to the plot. If that's really the case, the story needs to put emphasis on both. I understand Shallan's story in TWoK can be boring to some people. I also understand how it can feel like a B plot. But I don't think it isn't important - in fact, I think it's crucial.

On another note, I would love to hear your thoughts of Shallan! I wrote this nainly because when I never really heard anyone bring this aspect of her story up when discussing her character, and thought maybe I could. If you disagree with me, please tell me why! Y'all are awesome people and you always have really interesting opinions. Also, wow, you read all that? Random reader, you have my respect.",Stormlight_Archive,Unpopular opinion of Shallan (spoilers)
1148,"I recently began my first reread of Oathbringer in preparation for Rythm of War. Tbh, I've been dreading it, not because I hate it, but because I know exactly what picking up a Brandon Sanderson novel does to me. I was having trouble putting it into words, but then I got to Teft's chapters and it hit me what an apt comparison it is. Reading one of his novels is like grinding firemoss, a slow burn that consumes everything.

When reading, I lose interest in everything else. I don't eat properly, I sleep less, I stop working out, I'm constantly trying to sneak in a few pages here and there when I should be focused on other stuff. Anything just to get another hit from those glorious pages, and a book as thick as Oathbringer is like a particularly big bowl of moss. It's been a pretty busy few years for me, so while I've gotten a hit here and there (thanks Skyward), I've been purposefully avoiding the real heavy hitters so I don't go full Teft. I fully expect to fall off the wagon in November, but for now I've been able to keep my addition in check by setting limits on my reading, and never bringing the book anywhere to avoid temptation, not even into the living room since I work from home. 

The one consolation is that I know with Brandon, I never have to wait too long before my next bowl of moss shows up in my mailbox.",Stormlight_Archive,A Sanderson novel is like firemoss
1149,"So I just found out that back in 2015 Sanderson made some kind of tweak/change to the end scene to WoR. Does anyone know which editions have the changed version? I have the mass market paperback version.

1151,"What happened to jakamav after the duel in WoR? I dont think we ever hear mention of him again. I know he isn't like a main character by any means, but Its interesting how we dont hear anything, and that adolin doesnt spare another thought for his former friend.",Stormlight_Archive,Jakamav?
1152,"Man I loved this book! I thought TWoK was good, but this seemed even better to me! I don't know if it's that I read it more recently, or what, but it was just spectacular. Hearing that Oathbringer is (arguably) even better just makes me impatient to read it!

Bruh, Jasnah dying in the first five seconds of the book threw me for a loop. I kind of expected her to stay with Shallan for a while and tutor her about Shadesmar, Pattern, and whatnot, but I guess that we can just sack her too. lol. And Shallan did pretty well without her, I'd say! Her interactions with the Ghostbloods were super interesting to read. I wonder how that'll work in the future, with her being a Radiant now and all. Her flashbacks were... yeesh. Painful. Well written. Very good. The blackbane... yes. The lullaby... jawhefoiu ouch! Stay strong Shallan :(

Kaladin is being a badass for the whole book. God damn, the ""Honor is dead"" part that everyone was going on about finally makes sense, and WHEW it was good. I was so happy when I read that. (Though the conclusion of that scene kind of spoiled my happiness, but still! and renarin wtf) And the parts where Syl was gone were crushing. The poor guy was so lonely and desperate. I was so, so happy when she came back.

Dalinar is doing well throughout the book too. He's really warming up to his job and performing it admirably. I really actually did enjoy his parts in this book, though he was slightly overshadowed by some other characters. And wow, did he just bind the Stormfather himself? I am very much looking forward to that in book 3. I have a feeling he'll be a refreshing change from Syl and Pattern (who was  a refreshing change himself).

Adolin's back at it again! He was probably my favorite character to read in this book, just because it was like... He's finally doing what he's good at! The sword is out of its sheath! The first duel he did was spectacular. Watching him crush that poor guy... lol. And of course the ""Honor is dead"" scene, and then the going to jail with Kaladin, and murdering Sadeas.... wait no crud go back

Sidenote, for now I ship Kaladin/Shallan and also Shallan/Adolin they're both great ships eeehehe

Now for some of the less prominent things.

Warbreaker spoilers: &gt;!Is Zahel just Vasher in disguise? It didn't occur to me when I was reading his Interlude, but after Nightblood was shown, I immediately jumped back to that interlude and went ""oh shoot he senses Kaladin oh shoot he uses color metaphors oh shoot he expected a voice in his head was it Nightblood oh shoot!"" The evidence lines up, that's for sure. I'll be sure to keep an eye on him in the future.!&lt;

What the hell is up with Renarin? He's just chilling, and then at the end of the book: ""by the way I am a radiant, hello."" That was random. Also lol: ""He flies, he bonds, I make illusions, what do you do"" ""I see!"" 

Talenaletnlantlinnalint'elin is confusing and I have no meaningful commentary on him yet

Taravangian's interlude (did I spell that name right lol) was really intriguing! The varying intelligence is so weird, lol. And the diagram! The notes from the diagram are another super interesting thread to follow. AND THE PART WHERE HE SEES SZETH AND ABSOLUTELY FREAKS OUT LOL that's probably my favorite moment in the book lmao. 

SPEAKING OF SZETH I love Szeth he's so good! I freaking love him! He's my favorite character maybe. I love him! ahhhghgh and the part where he died and I was like :( but I was still fine with it because he accepted it. And then he was back and I was like :) and then he got Nightblood and I was like :D

(First of all, how is Nightblood even here? Second of all, he can't be a Shardblade like Nin says he is, because Shardblades are said to be dead spren. We know how Nightblood was created if we read Warbreaker, and it was not by killing a spren. What's the deal?)

hehe, Hoid has perfect pitch now. I saw that, you sneaky punk. Greetings from Hallendren

Hoid is enigmatic. That's all I have to say. He's fun to read, though. And... okay, I'm glad Jasnah is back, but that felt kind of cheap. I haven't actually seen how she was allowed to revive herself, so I'll reserve my judgement on that though.

I'll start OB soon! (Unfortunately, I don't have access to Edgedancer, so I'll have to skip it for now.)",Stormlight_Archive,Just finished WoR!

1155,"I have been a big fan of the Stormlight Archive for a while now and I wanted to make a post to discuss future memorabilia ideas. This post idea comes about from the Kickstarter Brandon and his team have put together. Link if you've been hiding from a highstorm under a rock: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/the-way-of-kings-10th-anniversary-leatherbound-edition?ref=28cb1w](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/the-way-of-kings-10th-anniversary-leatherbound-edition?ref=28cb1w)

I am going to participate in the kickstarter, but only at the lower tiers. One of the reasons for this is because I am not too interested in most of the memorabilia available. I think what Brandon and his team have come up with is great (I want the wit coin so bad), but most of it just isn't for me . I imagine I am not alone in this, simply because it is impossible to make everyone happy, and I also imagine that other people, like me, have ideas of memorabilia that they would like to own.

So, I wanted to make a list of ideas I have had about memorabilia that could be used for future stormlight anniversary/release events, and I want to see what ideas you have. \*\*I would like to note that I think my ideas are original, but someone else could have stated some of these ideas elsewhere and I just havent seen it\*\*

Without further ado, my list:

\-Small (like 6 in.) metal shardblades or honorblades for the different blades we have seen in the books that are proportional to the real swords. It would be doubly cool if they were sharp and sold as letter openers. 

\-DnD style models for characters (Named characters, Shardbearers, Parshendi, Heralds, Fused, Shards, Alethi soldiers, Soulcasters), creatures (Chasmfiend, whitespine, lanceryn, spren), and locations of roshar (buildings, terrain, ships) that could be used as minis in tabletop RPG. These could be the actual minis or the files so someone could print them on their own.

\-Rosharan money like broams/chips/marks, with fake gems. It would also be sweet if their was ever a Stormlight Con and you could use rosharan money at the vendor stands instead.

\-A soulcaster that people could wear that was made of metal with fake gems.

\-An art book called ""Ars Arcanum"" that is a formalized version of what is in the back of each of the books with art for each order of knights

\-An art book called ""Shallan's Sketchbook"" that looks like a sketchbook and is a collection of all of Shallan's sketches.

\- A totally unrealistic dream would be a ""Total War"" game like Total War: Warhammer or Total War: Three Kingdoms with the setting being on Roshar/Cosmere. So you could literally play as a herald/shardbearer leading an army to fight the different nations, build a coalition, and survive the desolation. Or as the Sunmaker as he unites the Alethi Kingdoms and seeks to conquer Roshar. You could also add things like winning duels against a shardbearer lets you keep their shards, or a soldier who survives an unwinnable battle becomes a knight radiant, or you can upgrade knights under your command to have better skills/swear more oaths but they become more limited in what they can do on the battlefield. You could have a campaign on the shattered plains.

Ooh hello. This isn't Lift! So who is this mysterious character. Well we have a name! Hauka. 

I'm assuming Tallew is some sort of grain. For some reason my dumb ass thought it was the city name till i checked and it was Yeddaw! That's what i get for reading late last night haha. Aiming to read it all today. If i can.

Liaforan. I like that. Idk why. Its satisfying to say😂 
I had to look at the Roshar map online and i gotta say i didn't even know it was a thing until this.

Yeah this farmer is corrupt as shit. But he isn't hiding anything so where does he get it from?!

Lovely to see they're as snobby and classist as the rest of Roshar and indeed Earth. Its awesome that its a realistic society but also its kinda sad that still these prejudices exist in the fantasy realms. Although it can sure make for interesting politicking!

Ooh lunch. That's made me hungry now!

Nun Raylisi and Tashi. I don't remember these before. Interesting. And they're enemies. Hmm. Raylisi and Rayse. Sorta sound similar. Tashi and Ishar? That's the only similar sound i can think of. Although we did have a similar dynamic between the brother gods in the purelake religions.
But why could Tashi only protect them in Tashikk i wonder.

Ooh is this the result of Taravangian's meddling?! Seems like everyone is gearing up for war.Who is the god king of the Tukari? And looking at the map of Roshar, Tukar is where that city Lift mentioned was and what Kal saw in his vision! Seems like there's more to that location than we know right now. Briefly skimming WoK ch 46 i now see the reference to Sesemalex Dar with the long troughs and war nearby. It seems these wars have been going on a long time or Kal saw a vision of the future and I'm more inclined to the former.

Wow. Nasty guy taking advantage of the war. Humble farmer my ass. Good the money will go to supporting refugees.

Unpredicted highstorms mentioned again. Very clearly things are changing with the weeping, a foreshadow of the everstorm to come!

Hmm. I wonder why no open flame is allowed in the city.

Yeah farmer. Just take the deal!

Haha that's the way for Lift to make an entrance! But easily missed if you dont spot it, it is said she looks eleven or twelve. And we know she might have started growing. So I'm thinking this is a cheeky little reference!

Wow. That smuggler really is a nasty son of a bitch. Hates refugees.

Pancakes!! I can certainly sympathise with Lift's motives here haha.

Ok i just read the entire sequence here cus it was soo funny and engrossing plus theres not loads of reactions from within the whole thing so imma just cover the whole chase sequence. I had scenes from ratatouille in my mind weirdly when reading this! Iove it. Such pure boundless energy and humour for all the family. Love a good bit of slapstick, and when the two guards both reached and tripped it reminded me of thomson and thompson from Tintin!!

And then when Lift released all the grain to the refugees, it was brilliant! Hillarious and doing good in the world!

What this black dust is i have no clue. Reminded me of white sands actually! Ooh but i suppose it could be Wyndle when the crystals fade to dust. Probably is that. 

4

Handy reminder about Lift being partially in the cognitive realm. What the hell happened in her past? Was that why she was able to stay young but then now the cognitive realm is changing cus of Odium and that's why she's changing?

Omds i just imagined Lift using Wyndle as like an Indy style whip and now my brain is just thinking about what if you invested a whip with breath. That would be amazing to have like an Allomancer Jak style character with an invested whip. Someone totally needs to suggest this to Sanderson!!

I find it interesting they praise various gods and Heralds. Like not all just one. I suppose its probably a mixed bunch of Rosharan refugees which makes sense.

Oof. Bavland is totally being had right there haha. Seems like their morals are a bit askew😬

Minutes?!! Wow these people are starving. More than Lift! Although she should be awesome enough for a bit now eh.

Sure sure Lift. Trying to pass it off as self care but we all know you've got a kind heart. 

Alm or Desh. Man I am having to refer to the Roshar map a lot! Lift has been about!!

Woah. A roof tile? Lift my dude, what posessed ya!

Oooh so Zawfix is relatively close to Urithiru. That's cool. But boy Sanderson is working hard to get as much worldbuilding in as he can!!

Yeah I'm still curious why the storm water doesn't just totally flood the place! I hope the everstorm doesn't destroy all the shanties for the refugees, although i can't hold out much hope i don't think.

I love this vibrant feel of this quarter. It makes me think of the local poorer quarters in lots of third world countries which often can be filled more with colour and life than a lot of western cities.

Yeah i gotta say I'm with Wyndle on this one lift! Funny sequence but unnecessary energy wastage. 

Haha Wyndle back on his gardening rants again. Love it.

Wait is that Ym? Is this confirmation he is an edgedancer?! Well, was 😬. he did have rewgrowth so we knew he was an edgedancer or a truthwatcher. But could it be someone could have the potential to bond with more than one order?

Danger from the west. Well west of there would be Shinovar. Are they talking about Szeth?

Oh Wyndle. You really should be more careful what you say. I suppose he will have to get her to say the words eventually but if he doesn't want to become a shardblade, he doesn't have to be so obvious about it! Although luckily for him, Lift just dismisses it as Voidbringer nonsense!

Ooh that's kinda cool how Wyndle reads. 

Lift feeling a little claustrophobic eh. Well.i suppose the rich people of Yeddaw have wanted to quarantine the refugee quarter so to speak.

Interesting the crem change as you go west. What's up with that?!

Well if they want to sneak in/out it could be very useful Wyndle. I'm assuming the Grand Indicium is some kind of policing headquarters or something. 

Of course Lift would knock a lady by accident! Run!!!


5

People always turn anything into a miracle! Which devalues actual miracles!!

Woah so she doesn't remember her mother. Just like Dalinar doesn't remember his wife. Is this because she crossed to the cognitive so lost some of the memory like the spren do coming the other way? But then that would hint at Dalinar having some sort of cognitive connection. Oof my brain is alive with all these theories!!

Aww its so sad to see a 10 year old, well 13 year old, so happy and relatively carefree, feel such things as a loss of personal identity.

6

Ok i don't have a storming clue what was just said but i assume Wyndle will be getting a translation!

Ah yeah i remember Hauka talking about trading info. I like people who value information. 

Aha. So a fire is why they dont allow open flames in the city. Makes sense!

Yeah i can imagine if the patterns of storms become permanently irregular it could cause a lotttta problems for those who rely on stormlight for trade. Good thing they have info to share!

Huh. What are keenspren? Not heard of them before. I assume it isnt spren who show up when someone is keen to do something cus that would be a bit odd.

Ok i definitely feel like that was investiture linked. The ability to speak slang. It sounds similar to Connection from Mistborn E2. Curious indeed.

I love the little quirks Brandon puts in like this. The gems on strings makes it easy to keep track of though i guess. And yeah I'd definitely lose the little gem fragments lol. Lift ALWAYS manages to bring it back to food haha.

Ah yeah i see how it is. The ruffians can use the back entrance, unworthy of the city nobility and wealthy. 

A flat wide face? For some reason I'm struggling to imagine that. And Wyndle notices it too so maybe there's some kind of condition I'm not recognising. Idk.

Ooh a mysterious woman. We love mysterious peoples. It means mysteries and plot movement! I'm guessing she's abandoning the kid. Poor kid. With the scar too. Goodness knows what he's been through.

Well done Sanderson, painting the realities of orphanages. Not some happy clappy paradise for kids to share. Often they have mental health issues once they grow up and struggle to fit in. Definitely not what some people think they are.

Oh my. The hair. Oh no that's so sad. :( 

Haha Lift always manages hilarious descriptions of people!

Well she wasn't too helpful! But three meals is better than nothing! And she has her reasons.

Ok an old man or beggar in a story. Is this Hoid?! He did kinda just start talking out of nowhere talking about it being difficult to handle everyone's problems!

Yes Lift. You are extremely Awesome! I would love to see her vs twig face haha.

The Stump huh. What a name that is! I think I'd rather be called the rock or something else if I'm gonna be compared to something stoic like that!

Hmm. That's definitely odd. What's up with this sphere trading. Something underhand is going on.

Ok this question is classic Hoid. Its gotta be him. I'll eat Wayne's hat if it isn't!

Haha i like Lift's answer. Too good haha.

Ooh an appointment with whom?... lets find out!!

7

Yikes. Either one of those scams is very dodgy. I must admit i didn't have a clue about what was going on with the money exchange but laundering makes total sense.

Ha Wyndle, spend a bit of time with humans and you'll realise there are many shits like that taking advantage of people.

What a profound statement. Emotions are indeed a very powerful and dangerous tool as we can see in the world today.

A strange little horse with with horns. A bull? But that wouldn't be little. Lol. Hang on white and horns? If it only had one it would be a unicorn!

Eeek. Lift better survive the everstorm i swear. Don't want her dying Sanderson!!

Aww poor Hauka. Rough day eh. Well maybe Lift can improve it for ya :)

Does nobody notice an adolescant girl climbing up the apartments?!!

Such attention to detail with all the flora and fauna in the worldbuilding. Love it.

What a beautiful sight that would be i imagine. The spheres lighting up the slots.

Lift clearly has some sort of idea of something going on here. But what?

Haha yes Wyndle, i think many of us often find ourselves in the same awe at the scrapes she gets herself into!

I wonder if this is a generic reference to nightmares or if there is actually something in her future that terrifies her when she sees it in her dreams. Guess we'll find out more in book 6 when we see Lift's flashbacks!

Haha Lift. Welcome to bed hair my friend!

Omds. Imagine the look on the farmers faces haha. Would they not have noticed before?!

Oh flip. What's darkness got to do with Hauka?!

Well she finally admits it! We all knew Wyndle was right. No matter how many pancakes she was gonna eat! But that whole thing earlier being a spectacle? Now that's great plotting. I just assumed it was a funny little sequence but it takes on such significance now!

Ooh i do hope we get to meet another prospective radiant. That would be cool.

I, Lift, would argue its both. You feel a loss of identity and things changing, so you look to another like you to explain what's going on, aaannd you have a sense of justice too.

Prince of Tashikk. I wonder who that is. And what are the bets Nale has used orders from his time period to get away with his work!

So, Hauka has been trading with twig lady maybe. Interesting.

Well that's gonna put a spanner in the works for Lift, now everyone is gonna be looking for her!

Are you crazy kid?! Tailing Nale? Madness i swear!!!

8

Yep the walls are definitely gonna feel smaller if loads of people are hunting you😬

Ha probably tourists lol. Lucky Lift is preoccupied!

I don't know why either! There's probably some clever scientist out there who reads the books and has figured out why it disappears after half a day of inactivity. 

Well tbh if i saw a man with a scar like that walking with purpose, I'd probably step out of the way too!

Hmm. Does Nale has some invisibility ability? If Lift loses track of him but never loses track of normal people. Guess we might find out later!

Phew. You nearly messed it up Lift! Be more careful next time. Could be you the shopkeeper shouts at!!

Uh oh. Hes a skybreaker. He won't take this lightly at all.👀

Holy shit. Did he really have to use a fucking shardblade?!

And he just fills the paperwork and goes to leave with no further thought! How was this man ever a Herald? He doesn't seem honourable. 

Hmm this seems to imply Nale knows Tashi and Tashi is real. So maybe it is one of the heralds then and he could be out in the world again considering what Nale says here. But he says it like its a bad thing. Two mad heralds, a barbaric one, and maybe another one too now. But when will he arrive I wonder. 

Wow. He just refers to the legalese. No heart. Seriously, what happened to these guys? And he's even confused why nobody understands. Its just beyond belief.

Ooh was that a cognitive shadow? That's cool.

Yeah Lift, it's severed the soul so too late for you kiddo :(

Wow ok. Lift really likes danger huh.

Ooh thats interesting. I imagine this is where a lot of their shared water comes from.

Yes Lift! I will remember those who others forget!!

Eyes you cannot see. Local spies or maybe even Szeth himself? Eek!

Yes i knew it! There is something supernatural about his ability to disappear. Makes it even riskier!

Oof ok Tashi has gotta be a herald then. 10 heralds. 

Lool Wyndle trying to warn Lift and she just doesn't care haha. I wonder how many words there are to say.

Well she isn't wrong there Wyndle. She'd never get over her own death!!!

Oh so now she worries about people seeing her hanging! Although it was night before so it makes more sense now. I didn't consider that at the time.

Well thats an awesome use of her regrowth. And Lift is right. Often people are too busy in the mundane they can miss something awesome right in front of them!

Flipping heck Wyndle. You'd have thought he was high or something lol. Whst a reaction! But he is a gardener i suppose!!

Is it just me or is always old male guards who are there whenever a character sneaks in somewhere in like every book or movie ever haha. But Nale does seem to be recruiting for his order. They could be a LOT of trouble in Oathbringer.

Of course Lift found the food first😂 but at least she can gain back some stormlight now since no doubt she'll need to use it.

Yeah Wyndle. Its very obvious you need to stop Nale! Its the edgedancer thing to do. 

You know what i thought about just now. The reversed positions of the radiants and the heralds. In the stories the radiants grew corrupt or whatever and they're bad but the heralds are perfect. So far, the radiants we've met are by no means perfect, but the Heralds are also not who we were led to believe they were.

Well i got work tomorrow and its nearly 10 here so I'm calling it quits about halfway now. Back on it in the morning! 

Don't forget tomorrow, 7/7/20 is Leatherbound Kickstarter Day guys!!! Just don't take all the copies before i can order one😝

And just as a heads up, i predict I'll finish Edgedanxer tomorrow, then probably Weds i will make a post of my own oathbringer predictions and listen to the shardcast predictions episode. Thursday the 9th my journey through Oathbringer should begin, and I'm gonna aim to finish by my 21st, the 16th October, so 14 weeks. I did WoR in about 12 so i think its achievable. Then i will look into the RoW release extracts and if the novella is out, i have a month to make my way through that too!",Stormlight_Archive,Edgedancer ch 3- 8 readthrough

1168,"I have been thinking about the cold nature that comes over Taravangian as his intelligence increases. The smarter the less he cares for feelings. He said on the Day of the Diagram (DotD) he may have been 1,000x more intelligent him than his best in day in the last 500, maybe more. So at that level how much would he care about himself? He has always seemed willing to sacrifice himself. I suspect the Diagram is designed to do just that. The people working the Diagram, including Taravangian (the Cult of the Diagram, or just the Cult) seem to assume the Diagram was made as understandable as his genius could manage in its haste. What if DotD Taravangian predicted the rate of deciphering the Diagram, so that the “revelations” of the Diagram are learned at the times to guide his less intelligent selves into forcing the outcome DotD Taravangian wants, which may or may not be the same as the rest of him the on the other days. I find it unlikely he could desire to not save humanity, since the capacity to save humanity was the thing he sought. I entertain he may be more brutal than any other might imagine, such as the extinction of Singers, humanity as livestock enslaved to Singers, a small minimal population with a calculated minimum of genetic variety accounting for future accidents. On the other hand, it might be that DotD Taravangian is manipulating himself to consolidate, human forces under an otherwise unlikely leader (Dalinar seems too obvious, but maybe a dark eyes , a woman, a Horneater, etc), or to possibly position himself to be the champion of Odium only to time one of his tremendous surges of compassion to fracture and poison Odium’s hatred. Of course it might be something else. It just fits the kind of surprise the characters in Stormlight Archive tend to get.

1175,"Came up with a theory on the Sibling - as to what they might be and their subtle presence in the series thus far.

Recall that The Sibling is the third super-spren on similar power to Nightwatcher and Stormfather. And currently they ""slumber"". They are supposed to be of Odium but from the minor pieces of info we have they seemed to working with the Radiants. So perhaps they splintered from Odium's influence long ago.

The idea is inspired by the religion ""The One"" where it is believed that there is just one person that lives multiple lives.
Perhaps, the Sibling is something like that - lives through lives of multiple people at the same time throughout the generetions upon generations with only a few having realized what they actually are. This would also explain why Sibling is referred as ""they"" - are they are multiple and not just lacking gender.

Their power would be splintering... of soul/personality.

So I just tried to look through the series and check for whatever appears as manifestation of this power.

1) Shallan's ability to develop new identities. This ability of hers seems to be greater than just mnemonic powers of Lightweavers. Also, Sje Anat seems to be especially interested in Shallan - as possible being part of such a super-spen may allow her to splinter Sje Anat from Odium.

2) Lopen - perhaps it isn't just a gag but actually group of people that realized themselves as being part of The Sibling which brings them together.

3) Odium has power to kill other gods - or rather to splinter the Shards. Possibly Sibling is the manifestation of this power.",Stormlight_Archive,Theory on The Sibling

1178,"&gt;!First, you must get a spren to approach.!&lt;

&gt;!The type of gemstone is relevant to this, as some spren are naturally more intrigued by certain gemstones. More importantly, it is essential to provide the spren with something it knows and loves. The spren must be made to feel calm. A good fire for a flamespren, for example, is a must.!&lt;

&gt;!—Lecture on Fabrial Mechanics as presented by Navani Kholin to the Coalition of Monarchs, Urithiru.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin was impressed at how calm he felt as he checked the child’s gums for scurvy. Years of training as a surgeon served him well today. Breathing exercises—intended to keep his hands steady—worked just as well for harboring fugitives as they did for surgery.!&lt;

&gt;!“Here,” he said to the child’s mother, digging from his pocket a small carved carapace chit. “Show this to woman at the dining pavilion. She’ll get you some juice for your son. Make certain he drinks it all, each morning.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Very thank you,” the woman said in a thick Herdazian accent. She gathered her son close, then looked to Lirin with haunted eyes. “If . . . if child . . . found . . .”!&lt;

&gt;!“I will make certain you’re notified if we hear word of your other children,” Lirin promised. “I’m sorry for your loss.”!&lt;

&gt;!She nodded, wiped her cheeks, and carried the child toward the town. The morning fog obscured Hearthstone, so from the outside, it seemed a group of dark, shadowy lumps. Like tumors. Lirin could barely make out the tarps stretched between buildings, offering meager shelter for the many refugees pouring out of Herdaz. Entire streets were closed off, and phantom sounds—plates clinking, people talking—rose through the fog.!&lt;

&gt;!Those shanties would never last a storm, of course, but could be quickly torn down and stowed. There just wasn’t enough housing otherwise. He glanced at the line of those waiting for admittance today. Storms. How many more could the town hold? The villages closer to the border must be filled to capacity, if so many were making their way to Hearthstone.!&lt;

&gt;!It had been over a year since the coming of the Everstorm and the fall of Alethkar. A year during which the country of Herdaz—Alethkar’s small cousin to the north west—had somehow kept fighting. Two months ago, the enemy had finally decided to crush Herdaz for good, and that’s when the refugees had started appearing. Like usual, the soldiers fought while the common people—their fields trampled—starved and were forced out of their homes, looking to escape the conflict.!&lt;

&gt;!Hearthstone did what it could. Aric and the other men—once guards at Roshone’s mansion, now forbidden weapons—organized the line and kept anyone from sneaking into town before Lirin saw them. He had persuaded Brightness Abijan that it was essential he see each refugee and judge if they’d bring dangerous diseases into the city. More, he wanted to intercept those who might need treatment.!&lt;

&gt;!The woman he’d just seen carried her child up to the watch post outside of town. Here, a group of armed parshmen lifted her hood and compared her face to drawings that had been sent by the fused. Hessica, Lirin’s wife, stood nearby to read the descriptions as required. She was one of the few women in the city who could read, though Brightness Abijan and several of the other parshwomen were learning quickly in their lessons.!&lt;

&gt;!Parshmen carrying swords. Learning to read. Even a year after their awakening, Lirin found the notions odd. But really, what was it to him? In some ways, little had changed, despite the coming of the Everstorm and the awakening of the parshmen. The skin was different, but the same old conflicts consumed them as easily as they had the Alethi brightlords. People who got a taste of power wanted more, then sought it with the sword. Normal people bled, and Lirin had to try to put them back together.!&lt;

&gt;!He turned back to his line of waiting refugees. He still had at least a hundred to give medical assessments to today. Hiding among them was one in particular, a specific refugee. In some ways, that man was the author of all this suffering.!&lt;

&gt;!It wasn’t, however, the next person in line. That was a ragged man who had lost an arm in battle. The wound was a few months old at this point, and there was nothing that Lirin could do about the extensive scarring.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin held up his finger and moved it back and forth before the man’s face, watching his eyes track it. Shock, Lirin thought. “Have you suffered recent wounds you’re not telling me about?”!&lt;

&gt;!“No wounds,” the man whispered. “But brigands . . . they took my wife, good surgeon. Took her . . . left me tied to a tree. Just walked off, laughing . . .”!&lt;

&gt;!Bother. Mental shock wasn’t something he could cut out with a scalpel. “Once you enter the town,” Lirin said, “look for tent fourteen. Tell the women there I sent you.”!&lt;

&gt;!The man nodded dully, though his stare was hollow. Had he even registered the words? Memorizing the man’s description—graying hair with a cowlick in the back, three large moles on the upper left cheek, and of course the missing arm—Lirin made note to check at tent fourteen for him later tonight. He had assistants there watching refugees who might turn suicidal. It was, with so many to care for, the best he could manage.!&lt;

&gt;!“On with you,” Lirin said, gently pushing the man toward the town. “Tent fourteen. Don’t forget. I’m sorry for your loss.”!&lt;

&gt;!The man walked off.!&lt;

&gt;!“You say it so easily, surgeon,” a voice said from behind Lirin.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin stood and turned with surprise, then immediately bowed in respect. Abijan, the new citylord, was a parshwoman with stark white skin and fine red swirls on her cheeks.!&lt;

&gt;!“Brightness,” Lirin said. “What was that?”!&lt;

&gt;!“You told that man,” Abijan said, “you were sorry for his loss. You say it so easily to each of them—but you seem to have the compassion of a stone. Do you feel, surgeon, for these people?”!&lt;

&gt;!“I feel, Brightness,” Lirin said, “but I must be careful not to be overwhelmed by their pains. It’s one of the first rules of becoming a surgeon.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Curious.” The parshwoman raised her safehand, which was shrouded in the sleeve of a havah. “Do you remember setting my arm when I was a child?”!&lt;

&gt;!“I do.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Such a curious memory,” she said. “That life feels like a dream to me now. I remember pain. Confusion. A stern figure, bringing me more pain—though I now recognize you were simply seeking to heal me. So much trouble to go through for a slave child.”!&lt;

&gt;!“I have never cared who I heal, Brightness. Slave or king.”!&lt;

&gt;!“I’m sure the fact that Wistiow had paid good money for me had nothing to do with it.” She narrowed her eyes at Lirin, and when she next spoke, there was a cadence to her words . . . as if she were speaking the words to a song. “Did you feel for me, the poor, confused slave child whose mind had been stolen from her? Did you weep for us, surgeon, and the life we led?”!&lt;

&gt;!“A surgeon must not weep,” Lirin said softly. “A surgeon cannot afford to weep.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Like a stone,” she said again, then shook her head. “Have you seen any plaguespren on these refugees? If those spren get into the city, it could kill everyone.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Diseases isn’t caused by spren,” Lirin said. “It is spread by contaminated water, improper sanitation, or sometimes by the breath of those who bear it.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Superstition,” she said.!&lt;

&gt;!“The wisdom of the Heralds,” Lirin replied. “We should be careful.” Fragments of old manuscripts—translations of translations of translations—spoke of ancient diseases that had killed thousands, spreading quickly and persistently. Such things hadn’t been recorded in any modern texts he’d been read, but he had heard rumors of something strange to the west—a new plague, they were calling it. Details were sparse.!&lt;

&gt;!Abijan moved on without further complaint at him. Her attendants—a group of elevated parshmen and parshwomen—joined her. Though their clothing was of Alethi cuts and fashion, the colors were lighter, more muted, than human women might wear. The fused had explained that singers in the past eschewed bright colors, as to not distract from their skin patterns.!&lt;

&gt;!He sensed a search for identity in the way Abijan and the other parshmen acted. Their accents, their dress, their mannerisms—they were all distinctly Alethi. But they grew transfixed whenever the fused said about the lives of their ancestors, and tried whenever they could to emulate those long dead parshmen. Or, eln-singers they were being called. Old singers, in their language. Contrasted with the niv-singers, the modern punch of parshmen who had awakened.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin turned to the next group of refugees—a complete family for once. Though he should have been happy to see that, he couldn’t help wondering how difficult it was going to be to feed five children and parents who were flagging from poor nutrition.!&lt;

&gt;!As he sent them on, a familiar figure moved down the line toward him. Laral wore a simple servant’s dress now, with a gloved hand instead of a sleeve, and she carried a water bucket. Ostensibly, she was giving water to the waiting refugees. Laral didn’t walk like a servant, though. There was a certain . . . determination about the young woman that no forced subservience could smother. The end of the world itself seemed roughly as bothersome to her as a poor harvest once had.!&lt;

&gt;!She paused by Lirin, offering him a drink. Ladled into a fresh cup, rather than taken straight from the bucket, as he insisted.!&lt;

&gt;!“He’s three down,” Laral whispered as Lirin sipped.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin grunted.!&lt;

&gt;!“Shorter than I expected him to be,” Laral noted. “He’s supposed to be a great general, leader of the Herdazian resistance. He looks more like a traveling merchant.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Genius comes in all shapes, Laral,” Lirin said, waving for another drink to give an excuse for them to keep talking.!&lt;

&gt;!“Still . . .” she said, then fell silent as Durnash passed by, a tall Parshman with marbled black and red skin, a sword on his back. Once he was well on his way, she continued softly. “I’m honestly surprised at you, Lirin. Not even once have you suggested we turn in this hidden general.”!&lt;

&gt;!“He’d be executed,” Lirin said.!&lt;

&gt;!“You think him as a criminal though, don’t you?”!&lt;

&gt;!“Criminal? I’m not sure. He bears a terrible responsibility for certain; he perpetuated a war against an overwhelming enemy force. He threw away the lives of his men in a hopeless battle.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Some would call that heroism.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Heroism is a myth you tell idealistic young people—specifically when you want them to go bleed for you. It got my son killed and my other son taken from me. You can keep your heroism and give me back the lives of those wasted on foolish conflicts.”!&lt;

&gt;!At least it seemed to almost be over. Now that the resistance in Herdaz had finally collapsed, the fused had secured dominance of the country, like they had Alethkar. Hopefully, the refugee flood would slow now, and everything could settle back down.!&lt;

&gt;!Laral watched him with those blue eyes of hers. She was a keen one. How he wished life had gone another direction; that old Wistiow had held on a few more years. Lirin might, in that case, call this woman daughter, and have both of his sons beside him—with Kaladin trained to be a surgeon, not a killer.!&lt;

&gt;!“I won’t turn him in,” Lirin said, looking away from Laral’s questioning gaze. “Stop looking at me like that. I hate war, but I won’t condemn your hero.”!&lt;

&gt;!“And your son will come fetch him soon?”!&lt;

&gt;!“We’ve sent him word. That should be enough. Just be sure your husband is ready with his distraction.”!&lt;

&gt;!She nodded and moved on to offer water to the parshmen guards at the city entrance. Lirin got through the next few refugees quickly, and then moved on to a group of cloaked figures.!&lt;

&gt;!He calmed himself with the quick breathing exercise his master had taught him in the surgery room all those years ago. So it was that though his insides were a storm, his hands didn’t shake as he waved forward the first of the men.!&lt;

&gt;!“I will need to do an inspection,” Lirin said softly, “to not make it seem so unusual when I pull you out of the line.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Begin with me,” said the shortest of the men as he stepped forward. The other four shifted their positions, placing themselves carefully around him.!&lt;

&gt;!“Don’t look so much like you’re guarding him, you fools,” Lirin hissed. “Here, sit down on the ground. Maybe you’ll seem less like a gang of thugs that way.”!&lt;

&gt;!They did as requested, and Lirin pulled over his stool, settling down beside the shortest of the men. He bore a thin mustache on his upper lip, silvered to grey, and was perhaps in his fifties. His sun-leathered skin was darker than most Herdazians; he almost could have passed for Azish. His eyes were a cool, soft green.!&lt;

&gt;!“You’re him?” Lirin whispered as he put his ear to the man’s chest to check his heartbeat.!&lt;

&gt;!“I am,” the man said.!&lt;

&gt;!Dieno enne Calah. Dieno “The Mink” in Old Herdazian. Hessica explained that enne was a very specific kind of honorific—with an implied “greatness” to the wording.!&lt;

&gt;!One might have expected—as Laral apparently had—the Mink to be a brutal warrior cast from the same forge as men Like Dalinar Kholin or Meridas Amaram. Lirin, however, knew that killers came in all kinds of packages. The Mink might be short, and might be missing a tooth, but there was a power to his lean build, and Lirin spotted not a few scars in his inspection. Those around the wrists, in fact . . . those were the scars manacles made on the skin of slaves, if worn too long.!&lt;

&gt;!“Thank you,” Dieno said as Lirin continued his inspection, “for offering us refuge.”!&lt;

&gt;!“It wasn’t my choice,” Lirin said.!&lt;

&gt;!“Still, you ensure that the resistance will escape to live on. Heralds bless you, surgeon.”!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin dug out a bandage, then began wrapping a wound on the man’s arm that hadn’t been seen to properly. “The heralds bless us with a quick end to this conflict.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Yes, with the invaders sent running all the way back to the Damnation from which they were spawned.”!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin continued his work.!&lt;

&gt;!“You . . . disagree, surgeon?”!&lt;

&gt;!“Your resistance has failed, general,” Lirin said, pulling the bandage tight. “Your kingdom has fallen, like my own. Further conflict will just leave more men dead.”!&lt;

&gt;!“Surely you don’t intend to just obey these monsters.”!&lt;

&gt;!“I obey the person who holds the sword to my neck, general,” Lirin said. “Same as I always have.”!&lt;

&gt;!He finished his exam, then did cursory looks over the general’s four companions. Now women. How would the general read messages sent to him?!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin made a show of discovering a wound on one man’s leg, and—with a little coaching—the man limped on it properly, then let out a painful howl.!&lt;

&gt;!“That will need surgery,” Lirin said loudly. “Or you might lose the leg. No, no complaints. We’re going to see to that right now.”!&lt;

&gt;!He had Aric—one of the town’s former guards—fetch a litter. Positioning the other four soldiers, general included, as bearers for that litter gave Lirin an excuse to pull them all out of line.!&lt;

&gt;!Now they just needed the distraction. It came in the form of Toralin Roshone. The former citylord stumbled out of the town—at this distance through the fog, he was just a dark figure that wobbled on unsteady feet.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin waved to the Mink and his soldiers, slowly leading them toward the inspection post.!&lt;

&gt;!“You aren’t armed, are you?” he hissed under his breath.!&lt;

&gt;!“We left obvious weapons behind,” the mink replied, “but it will be my face—and not our arms—that betrays us.”!&lt;

&gt;!“We’ve prepared for that.” Pray to the almighty it works.!&lt;

&gt;!As Lirin drew near, he could better make out Roshone through the fog. The former citylord’s skin hung in deflated jowls these days, still reflecting the weight he’d lost following his son’s death some six years ago. Roshone been ordered to shave his beard, perhaps because he’d been fond of it, and he no longer wore his proud warrior’s takama. That had been replaced by the knee pads and worker’s garb of a crem scraper.!&lt;

&gt;!He carried a stool under one arm and muttered to himself in a slurred voice. Despite a lifetime treating drunks who had suffered a fall or a fight, Lirin honestly couldn’t tell if Roshone had gotten himself drunk for the display, or if he was faking. He drew attention either way. The parshmen manning the inspection post nudged one another, and one hummed to an up-beat rhythm—something they often did when amused.!&lt;

&gt;!Roshone picked a building nearby and set down his stool, then—to the delight of the watching parshmen—tried stepping up on it, but missed and stumbled and nearly fell.!&lt;

&gt;!They loved watching him. Most of the parshmen in Hearthstone these days hadn’t been owned by Roshone—Abijan and three others were unique in that regard. But every one of these niv-singers had been owned by one wealthy lighteyes or another. Watching the former citylord reduced to a stumbling drunk who spent his days doing the most menial job in the city? To them, it was more captivating than any storyteller’s performance.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin stepped up with his charges. “This one needs immediate surgery,” he said, gesturing to the man in the litter. “If I don’t get to him now, he might lose the foot.”!&lt;

&gt;!Of the three parshmen assigned as inspectors, only Dor bothered to check the “wounded” man’s face against the drawings.!&lt;

&gt;!The Mink was top of the list of dangerous refugees, but Dor didn’t spare a glance for the bearers of the litters. He simply held up the drawings and went through a few of them, comparing them to the man in the litter. Lirin had noticed the oddity a few days back—when he used refugees from the line as labor, the inspectors often fixated only on the person in the litter.!&lt;

&gt;!He’d hoped that, with Roshone to provide entertainment, the parshmen would be even more lax. Still, Lirin felt himself sweating as Dor hesitated on one of the pictures. He’d told the Mink to only bring only low-level guards, who wouldn’t be on the lists. Could it still—!&lt;

&gt;!The other two parshmen laughed at Roshone, who was trying—despite his drunkenness—to reach the roof of the building and scrape away the crem build up there. Dor turned and joined them, absently waving Lirin forward.!&lt;

&gt;!Lirin shared a brief look with his wife, who waited nearby. It was a good thing none of the parshmen were looking at her, because she looked pale as a shin man. Lirin probably didn’t look much better, but he held in his sigh of relief as he waved the Mink and his soldiers forward. He could sequester them inside the surgery room, keep them away from the public eye until—!&lt;

&gt;!“Everyone stop what you’re doing!” a female voice shouted from behind. “Prepare to give deference!”!&lt;

im sure many of you have already see this on Brandon’s twitter. But I’m just curious that how many of the readers(or redditers) are planning to participate/pledge in this leatherbound kickstarter. 

I understand that you would get the physical leatherbound TWOK only through tier 3-6, which means over $200 and that’s a considerable financial committment for many of the reader(include myself). So while I already own the 1st ed for all the first three stormlight archive books, the extra rewards tiers that can be unlocked with this kickstarter seemed very attempting to me. 

So in the light of the kickstarter begins tomorrow, I just want to ask how many of us are planning on making the purchase and make an estimate on whether certain level of the rewards could be unlocked, which would potentially change my own decision.

1188,"First, you must get a spren to approach.

The type of gemstone is relevant to this, as some spren are naturally more intrigued by certain gemstones. More importantly, it is essential to provide the spren with something it knows and loves. The spren must be made to feel calm. A good fire for a flamespren, for example, is a must.

—Lecture on Fabrial Mechanics as presented by Navani Kholin to the Coalition of Monarchs, Urithiru.

Lirin was impressed at how calm he felt as he checked the child’s gums for scurvy. Years of training as a surgeon served him well today. Breathing exercises—intended to keep his hands steady—worked just as well for harboring fugitives as they did for surgery.

“Here,” he said to the child’s mother, digging from his pocket a small carved carapace chit. “Show this to woman at the dining pavilion. She’ll get you some juice for your son. Make certain he drinks it all, each morning.”

“Very thank you,” the woman said in a thick Herdazian accent. She gathered her son close, then looked to Lirin with haunted eyes. “If . . . if child . . . found . . .”

“I will make certain you’re notified if we hear word of your other children,” Lirin promised. “I’m sorry for your loss.”

She nodded, wiped her cheeks, and carried the child toward the town. The morning fog obscured Hearthstone, so from the outside, it seemed a group of dark, shadowy lumps. Like tumors. Lirin could barely make out the tarps stretched between buildings, offering meager shelter for the many refugees pouring out of Herdaz. Entire streets were closed off, and phantom sounds—plates clinking, people talking—rose through the fog.

Those shanties would never last a storm, of course, but could be quickly torn down and stowed. There just wasn’t enough housing otherwise. He glanced at the line of those waiting for admittance today. Storms. How many more could the town hold? The villages closer to the border must be filled to capacity, if so many were making their way to Hearthstone.

It had been over a year since the coming of the Everstorm and the fall of Alethkar. A year during which the country of Herdaz—Alethkar’s small cousin to the north west—had somehow kept fighting. Two months ago, the enemy had finally decided to crush Herdaz for good, and that’s when the refugees had started appearing. Like usual, the soldiers fought while the common people—their fields trampled—starved and were forced out of their homes, looking to escape the conflict.

Hearthstone did what it could. Aric and the other men—once guards at Roshone’s mansion, now forbidden weapons—organized the line and kept anyone from sneaking into town before Lirin saw them. He had persuaded Brightness Abijan that it was essential he see each refugee and judge if they’d bring dangerous diseases into the city. More, he wanted to intercept those who might need treatment.

The woman he’d just seen carried her child up to the watch post outside of town. Here, a group of armed parshmen lifted her hood and compared her face to drawings that had been sent by the fused. Hessica, Lirin’s wife, stood nearby to read the descriptions as required. She was one of the few women in the city who could read, though Brightness Abijan and several of the other parshwomen were learning quickly in their lessons.

Parshmen carrying swords. Learning to read. Even a year after their awakening, Lirin found the notions odd. But really, what was it to him? In some ways, little had changed, despite the coming of the Everstorm and the awakening of the parshmen. The skin was different, but the same old conflicts consumed them as easily as they had the Alethi brightlords. People who got a taste of power wanted more, then sought it with the sword. Normal people bled, and Lirin had to try to put them back together.

He turned back to his line of waiting refugees. He still had at least a hundred to give medical assessments to today. Hiding among them was one in particular, a specific refugee. In some ways, that man was the author of all this suffering.

It wasn’t, however, the next person in line. That was a ragged man who had lost an arm in battle. The wound was a few months old at this point, and there was nothing that Lirin could do about the extensive scarring.

Lirin held up his finger and moved it back and forth before the man’s face, watching his eyes track it. Shock, Lirin thought. “Have you suffered recent wounds you’re not telling me about?”

“No wounds,” the man whispered. “But brigands . . . they took my wife, good surgeon. Took her . . . left me tied to a tree. Just walked off, laughing . . .”

Bother. Mental shock wasn’t something he could cut out with a scalpel. “Once you enter the town,” Lirin said, “look for tent fourteen. Tell the women there I sent you.”

The man nodded dully, though his stare was hollow. Had he even registered the words? Memorizing the man’s description—graying hair with a cowlick in the back, three large moles on the upper left cheek, and of course the missing arm—Lirin made note to check at tent fourteen for him later tonight. He had assistants there watching refugees who might turn suicidal. It was, with so many to care for, the best he could manage.

“On with you,” Lirin said, gently pushing the man toward the town. “Tent fourteen. Don’t forget. I’m sorry for your loss.”

The man walked off.

“You say it so easily, surgeon,” a voice said from behind Lirin.

Lirin stood and turned with surprise, then immediately bowed in respect. Abijan, the new citylord, was a parshwoman with stark white skin and fine red swirls on her cheeks.

“Brightness,” Lirin said. “What was that?”

“You told that man,” Abijan said, “you were sorry for his loss. You say it so easily to each of them—but you seem to have the compassion of a stone. Do you feel, surgeon, for these people?”

“I feel, Brightness,” Lirin said, “but I must be careful not to be overwhelmed by their pains. It’s one of the first rules of becoming a surgeon.”

“Curious.” The parshwoman raised her safehand, which was shrouded in the sleeve of a havah. “Do you remember setting my arm when I was a child?”

“I do.”

“Such a curious memory,” she said. “That life feels like a dream to me now. I remember pain. Confusion. A stern figure, bringing me more pain—though I now recognize you were simply seeking to heal me. So much trouble to go through for a slave child.”

“I have never cared who I heal, Brightness. Slave or king.”

“I’m sure the fact that Wistiow had paid good money for me had nothing to do with it.” She narrowed her eyes at Lirin, and when she next spoke, there was a cadence to her words . . . as if she were speaking the words to a song. “Did you feel for me, the poor, confused slave child whose mind had been stolen from her? Did you weep for us, surgeon, and the life we led?”

“A surgeon must not weep,” Lirin said softly. “A surgeon cannot afford to weep.”

“Like a stone,” she said again, then shook her head. “Have you seen any plaguespren on these refugees? If those spren get into the city, it could kill everyone.”

“Diseases isn’t caused by spren,” Lirin said. “It is spread by contaminated water, improper sanitation, or sometimes by the breath of those who bear it.”

“Superstition,” she said.

“The wisdom of the Heralds,” Lirin replied. “We should be careful.” Fragments of old manuscripts—translations of translations of translations—spoke of ancient diseases that had killed thousands, spreading quickly and persistently. Such things hadn’t been recorded in any modern texts he’d been read, but he had heard rumors of something strange to the west—a new plague, they were calling it. Details were sparse.

Abijan moved on without further complaint at him. Her attendants—a group of elevated parshmen and parshwomen—joined her. Though their clothing was of Alethi cuts and fashion, the colors were lighter, more muted, than human women might wear. The fused had explained that singers in the past eschewed bright colors, as to not distract from their skin patterns.

He sensed a search for identity in the way Abijan and the other parshmen acted. Their accents, their dress, their mannerisms—they were all distinctly Alethi. But they grew transfixed whenever the fused said about the lives of their ancestors, and tried whenever they could to emulate those long dead parshmen. Or, eln-singers they were being called. Old singers, in their language. Contrasted with the niv-singers, the modern punch of parshmen who had awakened.

Lirin turned to the next group of refugees—a complete family for once. Though he should have been happy to see that, he couldn’t help wondering how difficult it was going to be to feed five children and parents who were flagging from poor nutrition.

As he sent them on, a familiar figure moved down the line toward him. Laral wore a simple servant’s dress now, with a gloved hand instead of a sleeve, and she carried a water bucket. Ostensibly, she was giving water to the waiting refugees. Laral didn’t walk like a servant, though. There was a certain . . . determination about the young woman that no forced subservience could smother. The end of the world itself seemed roughly as bothersome to her as a poor harvest once had.

She paused by Lirin, offering him a drink. Ladled into a fresh cup, rather than taken straight from the bucket, as he insisted.

“He’s three down,” Laral whispered as Lirin sipped.

Lirin grunted.

“Shorter than I expected him to be,” Laral noted. “He’s supposed to be a great general, leader of the Herdazian resistance. He looks more like a traveling merchant.”

“Genius comes in all shapes, Laral,” Lirin said, waving for another drink to give an excuse for them to keep talking.

“Still . . .” she said, then fell silent as Durnash passed by, a tall Parshman with marbled black and red skin, a sword on his back. Once he was well on his way, she continued softly. “I’m honestly surprised at you, Lirin. Not even once have you suggested we turn in this hidden general.”

“He’d be executed,” Lirin said.

“You think him as a criminal though, don’t you?”

“Criminal? I’m not sure. He bears a terrible responsibility for certain; he perpetuated a war against an overwhelming enemy force. He threw away the lives of his men in a hopeless battle.”

“Some would call that heroism.”

“Heroism is a myth you tell idealistic young people—specifically when you want them to go bleed for you. It got my son killed and my other son taken from me. You can keep your heroism and give me back the lives of those wasted on foolish conflicts.”

At least it seemed to almost be over. Now that the resistance in Herdaz had finally collapsed, the fused had secured dominance of the country, like they had Alethkar. Hopefully, the refugee flood would slow now, and everything could settle back down.

Laral watched him with those blue eyes of hers. She was a keen one. How he wished life had gone another direction; that old Wistiow had held on a few more years. Lirin might, in that case, call this woman daughter, and have both of his sons beside him—with Kaladin trained to be a surgeon, not a killer.

“I won’t turn him in,” Lirin said, looking away from Laral’s questioning gaze. “Stop looking at me like that. I hate war, but I won’t condemn your hero.”

“And your son will come fetch him soon?”

“We’ve sent him word. That should be enough. Just be sure your husband is ready with his distraction.”

She nodded and moved on to offer water to the parshmen guards at the city entrance. Lirin got through the next few refugees quickly, and then moved on to a group of cloaked figures.

He calmed himself with the quick breathing exercise his master had taught him in the surgery room all those years ago. So it was that though his insides were a storm, his hands didn’t shake as he waved forward the first of the men.

“I will need to do an inspection,” Lirin said softly, “to not make it seem so unusual when I pull you out of the line.”

“Begin with me,” said the shortest of the men as he stepped forward. The other four shifted their positions, placing themselves carefully around him.

“Don’t look so much like you’re guarding him, you fools,” Lirin hissed. “Here, sit down on the ground. Maybe you’ll seem less like a gang of thugs that way.”

They did as requested, and Lirin pulled over his stool, settling down beside the shortest of the men. He bore a thin mustache on his upper lip, silvered to grey, and was perhaps in his fifties. His sun-leathered skin was darker than most Herdazians; he almost could have passed for Azish. His eyes were a cool, soft green.

“You’re him?” Lirin whispered as he put his ear to the man’s chest to check his heartbeat.

“I am,” the man said.

Dieno enne Calah. Dieno “The Mink” in Old Herdazian. Hessica explained that enne was a very specific kind of honorific—with an implied “greatness” to the wording.

One might have expected—as Laral apparently had—the Mink to be a brutal warrior cast from the same forge as men Like Dalinar Kholin or Meridas Amaram. Lirin, however, knew that killers came in all kinds of packages. The Mink might be short, and might be missing a tooth, but there was a power to his lean build, and Lirin spotted not a few scars in his inspection. Those around the wrists, in fact . . . those were the scars manacles made on the skin of slaves, if worn too long.

“Thank you,” Dieno said as Lirin continued his inspection, “for offering us refuge.”

“It wasn’t my choice,” Lirin said.

“Still, you ensure that the resistance will escape to live on. Heralds bless you, surgeon.”

Lirin dug out a bandage, then began wrapping a wound on the man’s arm that hadn’t been seen to properly. “The heralds bless us with a quick end to this conflict.”

“Yes, with the invaders sent running all the way back to the Damnation from which they were spawned.”

Lirin continued his work.

“You . . . disagree, surgeon?”

“Your resistance has failed, general,” Lirin said, pulling the bandage tight. “Your kingdom has fallen, like my own. Further conflict will just leave more men dead.”

“Surely you don’t intend to just obey these monsters.”

“I obey the person who holds the sword to my neck, general,” Lirin said. “Same as I always have.”

He finished his exam, then did cursory looks over the general’s four companions. Now women. How would the general read messages sent to him?

Lirin made a show of discovering a wound on one man’s leg, and—with a little coaching—the man limped on it properly, then let out a painful howl.

“That will need surgery,” Lirin said loudly. “Or you might lose the leg. No, no complaints. We’re going to see to that right now.”

He had Aric—one of the town’s former guards—fetch a litter. Positioning the other four soldiers, general included, as bearers for that litter gave Lirin an excuse to pull them all out of line.

Now they just needed the distraction. It came in the form of Toralin Roshone. The former citylord stumbled out of the town—at this distance through the fog, he was just a dark figure that wobbled on unsteady feet.

Lirin waved to the Mink and his soldiers, slowly leading them toward the inspection post.

“You aren’t armed, are you?” he hissed under his breath.

“We left obvious weapons behind,” the mink replied, “but it will be my face—and not our arms—that betrays us.”

“We’ve prepared for that.” Pray to the almighty it works.

As Lirin drew near, he could better make out Roshone through the fog. The former citylord’s skin hung in deflated jowls these days, still reflecting the weight he’d lost following his son’s death some six years ago. Roshone been ordered to shave his beard, perhaps because he’d been fond of it, and he no longer wore his proud warrior’s takama. That had been replaced by the knee pads and worker’s garb of a crem scraper.

He carried a stool under one arm and muttered to himself in a slurred voice. Despite a lifetime treating drunks who had suffered a fall or a fight, Lirin honestly couldn’t tell if Roshone had gotten himself drunk for the display, or if he was faking. He drew attention either way. The parshmen manning the inspection post nudged one another, and one hummed to an up-beat rhythm—something they often did when amused.

Roshone picked a building nearby and set down his stool, then—to the delight of the watching parshmen—tried stepping up on it, but missed and stumbled and nearly fell.

They loved watching him. Most of the parshmen in Hearthstone these days hadn’t been owned by Roshone—Abijan and three others were unique in that regard. But every one of these niv-singers had been owned by one wealthy lighteyes or another. Watching the former citylord reduced to a stumbling drunk who spent his days doing the most menial job in the city? To them, it was more captivating than any storyteller’s performance.

Lirin stepped up with his charges. “This one needs immediate surgery,” he said, gesturing to the man in the litter. “If I don’t get to him now, he might lose the foot.”

Of the three parshmen assigned as inspectors, only Dor bothered to check the “wounded” man’s face against the drawings.

The Mink was top of the list of dangerous refugees, but Dor didn’t spare a glance for the bearers of the litters. He simply held up the drawings and went through a few of them, comparing them to the man in the litter. Lirin had noticed the oddity a few days back—when he used refugees from the line as labor, the inspectors often fixated only on the person in the litter.

He’d hoped that, with Roshone to provide entertainment, the parshmen would be even more lax. Still, Lirin felt himself sweating as Dor hesitated on one of the pictures. He’d told the Mink to only bring only low-level guards, who wouldn’t be on the lists. Could it still—

The other two parshmen laughed at Roshone, who was trying—despite his drunkenness—to reach the roof of the building and scrape away the crem build up there. Dor turned and joined them, absently waving Lirin forward.

Lirin shared a brief look with his wife, who waited nearby. It was a good thing none of the parshmen were looking at her, because she looked pale as a shin man. Lirin probably didn’t look much better, but he held in his sigh of relief as he waved the Mink and his soldiers forward. He could sequester them inside the surgery room, keep them away from the public eye until—

“Everyone stop what you’re doing!” a female voice shouted from behind. “Prepare to give deference!”

Lirin felt an immediate urge to bolt. He almost did it, but the soldiers simply kept walking at an even pace. Yes, that was much better. Pretend that you hadn’t heard, or that the order didn’t apply to you.

“You, surgeon!” the voice shouted at him. It was Abijan. Reluctantly, Lirin stopped, excuses running through his mind. Would she believe he hadn’t realized who this was? Lirin was already in rough winds with the citylady after insisting on treating Jeber’s wounds after the fool had gotten himself strung up and whipped.

Lirin turned around, trying very hard to still his nerves. Abijan hurried up, and though singers didn’t blush, she was obviously flustered. When she spoke, her words had adopted a staccato cadence. “Attend me,” she said. “We have a visitor.”

It took Lirin a moment to process the words. She wasn’t demanding an explanation or ordering he be taken. This was about . . . something else?

“What’s wrong, Brightness?” he asked.

Nearby, the Mink and his soldiers stopped in place, but Lirin could see their arms shifting beneath cloaks. They’d said they’d left behind “obvious” weapons. Almighty help him, if this turned bloody . . .

“Nothing’s wrong,” Abijan said, speaking quickly. “We’ve been blessed. Attend me.” She looked to Dor and the inspectors. “Pass the word. Nobody is to enter or leave the town until I give word otherwise.”

The Way of Kings Prime is finally [here!](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/brandon-sanderson-online-library/#freebooks)

The Way of Kings Prime is an early (2002-2003) draft of the Way of Kings, which Team Dragonsteel has released for free as part of the tenth anniversary leatherbound special Way of Kings kickstarter. It is a *substantially* different narrative; some names are the same, some are different, but key characters make important different choices which changes the nature of events, and key timelines are changed. It is not canon, but it is an interesting alternate history with the power to provide a different light to illuminate things we already know about the Cosmere, and hints as to things we do not know.

As a reminder, we have established a[ new ""unpublished"" spoiler tag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/hm053s/announcement_additional_new_spoiler_flair_for/) for posts involving The Way of Kings Prime or other unpublished works.

1228,"&gt;Shallan sat back, inspecting her piece. She’d been so focused on the conversation, she’d just let her hands do the drawing, trusting in her instincts. The sketch depicted the king, sitting in his chair with a wise expression, the turretlike balcony walls behind him. The doorway into the balcony was to his right. Yes, it was a good likeness. Not her best work, but—     
&gt;  
&gt;Shallan froze, her breath catching, her heart lurching in her chest. She had drawn something standing in the doorway behind the king. Two tall and willowy creatures with cloaks that split down the front and hung at the sides too stiffly, as if they were made of glass. Above the stiff, high collars, where the creatures’ heads should be, each had a large, floating symbol of twisted design full of **impossible angles and geometries.**   
&gt;  
&gt;Shallan sat, stunned. Why had she drawn those things? What had driven her to—   
&gt;  
&gt;She snapped her head up. The hallway was empty. The creatures hadn’t been part of the Memory she’d taken. Her hands had simply drawn them of their accord.

Why did Shallan see two cryptics in the Kharbranth? Afair, every radiant we know saw only their own spren before speaking the oaths. Syl was annoying Kaladin by sticking his stuff, Jasnah just saw ivory during WoR prologue, Elhokar was just seeing one cryptic spren which he assumed to be an assassin. 

One possibility I can think is, Shallan saw ivory along with pattern but I don't think ivory has the head described here.  

If I have to guess, Taravangian is also on the path of being Lightweaver, and Shallan saw his cryptic with Pattern. The diagram he created has done a lot of killing and he has lied a lot. The face he maintained in front of people vs his actual actions are very different. I see this as a possible theory. 

Do you guys have other guesses?",Stormlight_Archive,Why did Shallan saw two creatures in Kharbranth

1251,"Ok. Been thinking about this for a bit as some pieces are coming together since the updated RoW synopsis was posted. So we know from WoB that Nightblood is able to completely destroy a fused for good by absorbing/destroying their investiture in all 3 realms leaving Odium nothing to pull back into the physical realm. Based on how the fused are scared of Azure's blade in Kholinar but not shardblades later I think we can safely assume that her attempt at making Nightblood 2.0 seems to have the same effect on investiture, although without the whole nasty side effect of needing a constant stream to not kill the wielder. 

So while Nightblood is likely going to be very important in the coming books fighting against the Fused, we now know that a chunk of RoW is Adolin and Shallan going to the Honorspren in Shadesmar. Well the last time we saw Azure she stayed with the Honorspren and agreed to tell them how her sword was made in return for information about Nightblood. 

**What do you all think about the possibility that the Honorspren have come up with some way to defeat the fused for good from studying Azure's blade?** 

Obviously they shouldn't have any way to awaken steel like Azure, but perhaps there is still something there. I know this isn't the stated goal of the expedition, but it seems like perhaps there may be a further benefit to the trip and just to parlay with the Honorspren about bonding new radiants.",Stormlight_Archive,A Certain Sword's role in RoW (No RoW spoilers beyond the synopsis on the back)

Do you think the spren want revenge, and are therefore choosing more 'evil' people to bond, or do you think the knights have corrupted their individual spren?
2. Why do so many of you seem intent on the fact that abrasion for Dustbringers will have the opposite affect from Edgedancers? We've really only seen this from Renarin and Dalinar, who are unique cases, and the rest of the time most surges seem to work the same for everyone.

This occurred to me because the first chapter from Sadeas’ perspective is after he has Oathbringer, so he might not have a chapter before this because he wasn’t accompanied by spren. It might just be fetching for a similarity with all POV characters and that it was just convenient for Sanderson to use each character as the story progressed.

1271,"My thoughts in one sentence: &gt;!what the fuck mate this was so good!&lt;.

I had read all of Mistborn Era 1 and Warbreaker before starting SA, but man, The Way of Kings just feel like it's on a whole other level compared to those. I am a huge sucker for stories that have a huge ""scope"" and a strong military-war-combat component and boy I was so happy after I started and realized what Kaladin's plot is about. Shallan had to grow on me, but after the initial reveal that she wants to steal the Soulcaster (which wasn't even an artifact???? definitely didn't expect that) I was hooked. I wanted to pace myself, knowing that Book 4 comes out in November, but I still ended up reading the entire book in a week.

But then it got even better as Dalinar chapters came in and I felt in love with the big man. *Ten Heartbeats* was an incredible chapter - one of those where you feel like every word was just perfect (sidenote: after hearing [an excerpt from the graphic audio on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ8kHq1I7dY) featuring it, I'm kiiind of considering getting all of the other audiobooks haha). 

Perhaps it's because I'm getting older, but I found Dalinar to be the most relatable and I thought his arc was great. Felt so good when he summoned Oathbringer to pay for the bridgemen, keeping up his promise. 

Speaking of which, don't get me started on the final battle. I teared up like a bitch when Bridge 4 decided to come back for Dalinar and then Kaladin jumped in to battle, sucking in Stormlight from all those gemstones on those guys' beards. Epic.

1280,"Spoilers for Oathbringer and for Elantris follow, so read at your own risk:

 &amp;nbsp;

 &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp; 

So, in my rereading of Oathbringer, I just finished the part where Alpha Team ran into the Lighthouse in Shadesmar. There, Kaladin meets with an Elantrian man who is an oracle. Kaladin touches the crystal ball and sees a vision. Once the vision is over, Kaladin's forehead hurts, and the Elantrian says, ""you must have some investiture."" 

At first the man says ""What Heightening are you?"" thinking that Kaladin must be Nalthian [Warbreaker]&gt;!(and might imply there are a lot more of them running around than Vivena and Vasher, or maybe he was just referencing them)!&lt;, then says ""no, no, oh you're a surgebinder."" 

Now, throughout the series, Kaladin's brands: did not heal with stormlight; ""melted"" the tattoo off of his brands to keep them front and center; and, randomly throb with pain. 

Putting all this together, I think Kaladin's brands might be an Aon. Now, I know most of the discussion of his brands centers around the idea that they're there because he (or Syl or both) sees himself as this broken man. The brands are him, and if that's how he sees himself, then that's probably why they never go away. But I think there's something more mystical at work here!

There are tons of limitations to AonDor, at least from what I recall. For example, the whole central issue with Elantris in the books is that some of the geography changes and so the whole thing falls apart. I'm not sure if such a ""sensitive"" magic system could or would maintain any power or influence so far away from its source if it's so specific and reliant on that geography to work. 

But I also don't think it has to work, maybe it can just ""be"" and be self preserving while on Roshar and do something when it's closer to Sel. I think when in Shadesmar, it was Kaladin's first time in a long while referencing a sensation on his forehead. Maybe Shadesmar is ""close"" to all the planets in that regard. Plus he was able to use the crystal ball without any stormlight, at least it doesn't mention him using any.

Besides for Wit, I don't think there are any beings we've seen that use multiple types of investiture from different planets (Mistborn has Twinborns and such but they're all contained on Scadrial), and I know Kaladin's brands are glyphs that mean certain things on Roshar. But maybe those specific brands in that specific way become an Aon. Maybe Sel geography has changed again in such a way that Kaladin's brands became an Aon. Maybe his brands will be the key to fix, or, at least, understand AonDor in the future. 

Like I said this is just a tinfoil hat thought of the evening, but I'm now more convinced than ever that I'm right. AND IF I'M RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS?!?! KALADIN IS ALSO A GODDAMN SEON. I will leave you all with that.",Stormlight_Archive,[Oathbringer][Elantris] My tinfoil thought of the evening regarding Bridgeboy's slave brands.
1281,"So I, like I assume many others, have been following the  WOK's kickstarter fairly closely since it started on July 7th. I really liked the idea of the challenge coins and was glad that both the order coins and the Wit coin got unlocked so quickly.  Seeing as Brandon Sanderson and the team at Dragon steel wanted to keep the back of the Wit coin a surprise until it was shipped I have had ideas rolling around in the back of my head as to what it might be. 

Seeing as the front of the coin says ""one can have a Wit"" and has a picture of Wit on it as well, my theory is as follows :

Writing: ""or one can be witless""
Picture: I think it will either be empty/blank (so truly witless) or have a polished/mirrored finish where you would see yourself in the reflection (I think the insulting side of this would be fitting with the Wit's personality not so much with Brandon's).

1294,"TDLR: I have paperbacks cause I like them and to keep my collection consistent I'd like to continue getting paperbacks, but when new books are released it's just the hardcover. Should I just make the switch to hardcovers now and save myself the pain of waiting?

Dear u/mistborn,

I am writing to you hear today to ask a question about one of your many great accomplishments as an author, *The Stormlight Archive*, and more specifically the upcoming book 4.

I have been a fan since I finished *Wheel of Time*, and have since read M*istborn* era 1, and after that started *The Way of Kings.* I am in love with the series, I am currently \~1/4 of the way through *Oathbringer* and am loving every page.

Anyways, on to the point of this post. I own the paperback editions for the first three books of SA. I think the covers are beautiful, they're the perfect size and I find paperbacks an easier read. With this in mind, I would prefer to get *Rythm of War* as a paperback copy. The problem with this is, of course, that when books are initially released, only the hardcovers are available. I have nothing against hardcovers, but for the purposes of keeping my collection in tact, and also for the enjoyment of my reading, I would prefer the paper backs. Sadly, I doubt I will have the capacity to wait 6-12 months to read your book that I'm sure will be spectacular, so I find myself in a bit of a predicament.

As this will be a long fantasy epic, that will span many more books, is it your opinion that I should just commit to hardcovers and eventually replace the first 3? As you obviously have more insight to the timeline, I am curious of your thoughts on the situation.

I appreciate the hard work you have put into your craft, and can tell you genuinely that your art has brought a source of happiness to my life. I hope you stay healthy during the pandemic, and have a great day.

Best,

A cosmere fan

1295,"So since it’s pretty much confirmed that singers will become Radiants, I have a question about them holding stormlight. We know that the singers consider humans too porous to be good conduits for stormlight. And we’ve also seen that Fused don’t really leak voidlight. So does this mean that Radiant singers won’t leak stormlight? I think that may be the case and probably because of their gemhearts. Also if you don’t know why I think singers will he Radiants it’s because of Venli and also Steve Argyle released official Willshaper artwork that displayed singers in shardplate as members of the order.

Kaladin is now a Knight Radiant. Which means he is their peer now. The only person in the world that can command him is Dalinar himself (because Kaladin allows him to), who has taken that “king of kings” role within Roshar. I understand that they all respect him, but that term feels super derogatory to me. Kaladin’s journey from slave to bridge man to radiant should be celebrated, not ridiculed.

Not to mention the actual bridge men, who with their new talents are the most disciplined and lethal military  squad in the known world right now. They have saved Dalinar, Elhokar, Adolin and Shallans lives on several occasions when they didn’t have to. Kaladin himself has saved all of them multiple times.

We know that the fused emulate the powers of orders of Knights Radiant, and the teleportation seems to be a use of the transportation surge. As we know that this is not how the elsecallers use this surge, it must be the Willshapers version of this power. 

In addition, this power seems to make use of the willshapers second surge of cohesion if as their name suggests they can use this surge on the cognitive aspect to shape wills, they might shape their cognitive aspect into a spren of sorts to travel like shown.

I do admit, this could be like it could be the elsecallers too as Kaladin speculated he could be soulcasting the new bodies, though we have not seen Jasnah use anything like it.

*And saluted.*

*Evi beamed. 'He asked the best way to talk to you,' she whispered. 'I told him you were a general, the leader of all the soldiers. He came up with that on his own.'*

*Dalinar squatted down. Little Adolin immediately shied back, reaching for his mother's skirts.*

*'Afraid of me?' Dalinar asked. 'Not unwise. I'm a dangerous man.'""* (Oathbringer, page 537)

Interlude 4

Woop second set here we go!

Steen huh. Are they heading for Aimia?

A soulcaster eh. What do they need her for i wonder?!

A new strange storm from Aimia. Interesting. We knew the people were mysteries from the Island but now the islands themselves are too.

Just had a look back, Puuli mentioned a hidden island in the ocean of origins and now they mention a hidden island of Aimia. Hidden from view due to their current position or literally a hidden island i wonder? Probably just a coincidence.

Does she think soulcasting is a condition? or is it something else. Lets RAFO!

Oh shit. They talked about this in WoR. Like a Savant in Mistborn. 

The void's playground. Were voidbringers here i wonder or just a name?

Hmm so Aimians soulcast to keep people out. Yet they watch over Roshar eagerly.

Is she seeing into Shadesmar as she slowly disintegrates?!

Hang on. Creatures WITH the spren?! What are they?!!

What would the other two modes be in a soulcaster?

Hmm so maybe the soulcasters were created by thr Aimians?

Shadow opposite direction like Jasnah!

Did the island make her sleepy?!

Woah the cook was Dysian Aimian! Cool. We absolutely need to learn more of them and their history! Why can't men come back here. And how could someone take the secrets from Kaza's soul?!

Interlude 5

Ooh hello. A genius day! Now this is gonna be interesting!

Ironic the dustbringers who are destructive would be the ones likely to save the world according to the Diagram. 

I love the snappy feel to the dialogue. You can sense the energy inside T.

Uscritic one? What does that mean?! 

Man i hate this elitist ethics T is spouting. Its logical in one sense but completely devoid of emotion. There's gotta be a harmony between the two surely. 

Ahhh so that's what that meant. Uscritic is stupid!

Interesting we now know it was before Renarin's birth. We may have known that before but i sure forgot if we did!

Ok so T is very super clever today. Trying to cheat past them. Lucky they spotted before he did something iffy.

Ooh interesting. Artifical light to encourage growth. I'm sure that's part of it but not the whole.

Wow that's a cool reversal. Born with the potential to have learning difficulties and going on to have one of the greatest minds of all time. Or so he says.

So callous to dismiss other parts of the world as not mattering.

Eek. That's scary because i could see Dalinar stepping down because no one can get beyond his past. 

No no no. You can't negotiate with pure hatred itself!

Oof this is what he asked the nightwatcher. His boon. The power to save us. But who does us refer to. Perhaps she interpreted it differently to T.


Interlude 6

Ooh what are they being chosen for? To be taken over by the dead Parshendi?

Huh. Who's this second one then eh. Clearly wants Venli a lot.

Oh flip. She's kept her mind but the others have been possessed!

Well damn. If Ulim is worried then shit has gone down eek!

Oof. Does Odium want her to be his champion maybe?!

Oh that's the spren that was near Eshonai! Just what is it?!!

58

Oof so whats the other way?! My first thought was this was the diagram since it sounded similar in the byline of it. But i just realised its actually an excerpt of the writings they found in the wall!

That would be quite the twist if it was Honor's plan to put Odium in the vision but i don't think they're right. Imagine if one of the people has already been influenced by Odium! Eek. Sad to see the visions go for now :(

Ohh he's that suspicious one from earlier i think. Rial. Gotta keep an eye on him.

Kaladin is becoming more lighteyed by the day😬 i trust him to make good use of the land though. 

Wow. Most of Alethkar. That's crazy they they all holed up in Urithiru and most of Alethkar is overrun.

Oh wow. This city seems beautiful. I couldn't find any fan art of it. A shame.

See this is more the destruction I'm on about from the Everstorm, this tangible sense that it's just battering them.

1306,"Something I love being able to do with the Stormlight Archive (which many of you can attest to) is introducing it to others. Some friends and family have tried them out and have all ended up becoming fans, which is great!

Sometimes though, they can't/won't give the books a try for multiple reasons. They're too long, they hate reading (seriously, could you imagine?), etc. The one that boggles my mind the most however, is ""I don't like to start things that aren't finished yet. I hate having to wait for new content, so I'd rather just wait for it all to be out so I can read it all at once.""

To that I have two things to say:

Have fun waiting until around 2040 for the series to be completed, and more seriously:

Journey before destination. With the Kickstarter of TWoK leather-bound, we as fans have already had 10 amazing years of the SA. Rereads are almost a must, and doing so only adds to the story with the incredible world building in each one. Finding small character moments you forgot about the first time that you can appreciate more can be really rewarding, whether it helps you like someone even more, or adds to your dislike of them (you know who I'm talking about). I've seen thousands of theories, questions, and memes that have been interesting, thought-provoking, hilarious or relatable that I never would have without giving these books a chance. Also having a place to see what other like-minded people like yourselves have to say about the series has been pretty great. 

**TL;DR** I don't want to get too mushy, but for those that had reservations about starting this series but ended up pushing through and are now here, I'm glad you did! (and I hope you are too) Has anyone else heard similar reasons listed above from others as to why they won't read the series? I don't think pity is the right word, but I do feel bad for someone (especially if they enjoy reading) if they won't give this series a chance.

1308,"Mistborn spoiler

It’s obvious from much of the Cosmere where Brandon stands on religion (Jasnah’s atheism being, largely, treated as weird; Sazed’s religion proving the “true” one in HoA), and that’s a stylistic/artistic choice informed by his experience and beliefs; and we all have to respect that.
However, I think it’s only right to assume that other people think differently. Where does everyone sit with religion in fantasy? I have to say, Sanderson’s take on religion in Elantris was something I found brilliant, with Hrathen being both an antagonist and protagonist at the same time with his religion. I generally prefer a story with a more cynical view on religion (like in ASOIAF, where the septons and faith-holders are snarkily looked down on).

1347,"Hey everyone,

We've been mulling over a few things and have decided to implement a few small changes, most of them temporary, to accommodate the release of Rhythm of War. Some of these have been mentioned previously, but some have not.

**TLDR... The most important takeaway from this announcement: If you make a post that contains RoW or Dawnshard spoilers, please note** ***in the post title*** **that it contains spoilers!**

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to voice them below! Keep it non-spoilery though, or else send us a private message.

# Tagging post titles for RoW and Dawnshard spoilers

We currently use post flair to indicate spoilers. However, it has come to our attention that the official Reddit app does not display flair on the home feed. We feel that subscribers can *generally* make due, as this has not previously been a significant issue, but with RoW preview chapters releasing and some fans preferring to avoid these, we want to introduce a temporary measure to help these subscribers out.

**From** ***now*** **until RoW is released we will require posts with RoW or Dawnshard spoilers to** ***make note of this in the post title in addition to the usual flair requirement.***

Automoderator will be removing posts flaired for `Rhythm of War` or `Dawnshard` if they do not include a spoiler warning *in the text of the post title*, and moderators will be looking for any edge cases that slip through. The same requirement extends to other flairs in which RoW/Dawnshard spoilers may be discussed; for example, RoW may not be discussed in a `Cosmere`\-flaired post unless the title includes a RoW warning. If your post gets removed for this, you will need to *repost* with a different title. (titles cannot be edited after posting)

You can indicate that your post contains RoW or Dawnshard spoilers with a bracketed tag, the full title of the book, or anything else that clearly indicates your post contains RoW/Dawnshard spoilers. For example, `[RoW]` or `[Rhythm of War]` or `(spoilers for RoW)` or `(spoilers for preview chapters)` are all acceptable. (to abbreviate Dawnshard, we recommend ""DS"")

Just to reiterate, this rule will only apply *until RoW is released*. After that, we recommend exercising caution or avoiding the subreddit until you're caught up on reading!

This will be enforced in r/Stormlight_Archive, r/Cosmere, r/brandonsanderson, and r/Mistborn.

# Approval requirement for RoW posts

This concerns another precaution we will be taking. It will not apply for several months, but we want to take this opportunity to remind everyone.

**One week prior to release ALL POSTS tagged for** `RoW` **(and beyond) will be** ***temporarily removed*** **until they can be manually approved by a moderator. We will plan to enforce this for one month following release.**

The intent of this temporary measure is to prevent leaks and to screen post titles for spoilers. A common issue we saw with Oathbringer was post titles that tended to be a bit more revealing than we want to see. We may begin enforcing this *sooner*, if we catch a leak prior to the planned start date. (Some book stores may begin putting the books on the shelf sooner than they are supposed to.) We may shorten or lengthen the period of enforcement, depending on our sense of the necessity.

We will do our best to be prompt, and have added mods to help with this effort, but please realize that your posts likely will not be instantly approved during that period!

This will be enforced in r/Stormlight_Archive and r/Cosmere.

# Book covers not permitted

**We will be removing ALL posts of RoW and Dawnshard book cover photos until the end of the year.**

Book cover photos are typically not allowed by Rule 6, though there are some exceptions. And Rule 6 is not enforced on Fridays. *These exceptions do not apply to this temporary rule regarding RoW and Dawnshard covers!*

The purpose of this temporary measure is to limit spam. EVERYONE here will be getting a book and EVERYONE will be excited about it. We know you're excited and want to share, but this isn't the best place for it. If everyone were to share a photo of their new book, there would be no room for discussion *about* the book. :)

This will be enforced in r/Stormlight_Archive, r/Cosmere, and r/brandonsanderson. If you REALLY want to share your excitement with a photo of your new book, you are more than welcome to post in r/SandersonShowAndTell! Also, just to be clear, this applies to people sharing images of their books. It doesn't mean somebody can't post the news whenever Tor finally reveals their cover. :)

# Flairs changed to full book titles

One thing that's permanent rather than temporary...

We've had some reports from people misidentifying spoiler flairs using book acronyms, and we think this is pretty understandable. Between WoK, WoR, and RoW it's a pretty easy mistake to make! To make it a *bit* more difficult for people to accidentally spoil themselves, we're changing the default flair so that the FULL book title is displayed.

As always, these are fully editable so that people can customize if needed. This isn't a *rule* against the use of acronyms in flair, and would generally encourage using them with the Warbreaker flair (for example) to prevent flair text from getting *too* long. But we hope this will help with clarity somewhat.",Stormlight_Archive,Announcement: Some temporary rules concerning the release of Rhythm of War and Dawnshard

My boyfriend's birthday is coming up and he Is a HUGE fan of Brandon Sanderson, especially of the Stormligh Archive. So, I was thinking of buying him the game Call to Adventure. I'm not really sure if this is a good idea because he doesn't have many friends who have read the book, and I also don't know if he will enjoy the game.
I'm also doubting since he never mentioned wanting the game or even told me about it. I came across it searching Sanderson's web. So maybe he's not interested. I really don't know and don't want to ask bc if I do get it I want it to be a surprise.

1375,"Brandon's TWoK 10th anniversary leatherbound Kickstarter ends in THREE days.

If you weren't aware, one of the lower tiers in the Kickstarter is for a new Stormlight novella planned for release in October, before RoW. The title is pretty intriguing and you can bet we'll be talking a LOT about this novella between RoW preview chapters. They've said this will be offered for general purpose *at some point down the road*, but if you want a copy on release day (or anytime SOON, so far as we know) then you need to get it in the Kickstarter!

*Processing img wiz4yyu5gze51...*

It's only $10 for the ebook! A hardback copy (shipped a bit later?) is in the $50 tier. (and higher tiers, if you also want to pick up a TWoK leatherbound)

Sounds like someone just before the recreance. Maybe the same person as the last one? Not much else to say.

The temple of Shalash. What are the bets all the statues are defaced!

Ooh i don't think somebody else is receiving their prayers but now it has me uncertain. 

There we go! Faces broken off. Knew it!

Lool. Dalinar's scowls. Makes sense tbh.

Is this a clue to what happened before? He abandoned his duty and something bad happened? Or maybe a reference to Gavilar's assassination. 

I'm assuming Battah is a Herald. I forget them all lol except the main ones of Taln, Shash, Nale, Jezrien and Ishar. I got half of them! Dunno what Paralet is though.

Oh wow. They've really been hit here. Why so badly here? Ngl i got T hospital vibes even though this id actually a one for good lol.

Well T is certainly putting on a show! I suspect this is a somewhat clever day considering he's gotten Fen to accept more of their people.

Why is Dalinar so curious about the son eh?

Oof i suspect Dalinar has overplayed his hand here. Bit early to be talking about troops being brought in to help build and then disrespectful to not have studied the maps better.

A lesson with Sadeas. Anything with Sadeas doesn't sound great tbh!

Ha! the irony of a statue of Taln alone fighting the forces of evil.

Wish there was fan art of this. Can't seem to find any! Would be cool to see Thaylen city and the temples.

I really don't see how Dalinar attacking Fen's son is gonna help anything but i guess image is everything in politics. Well for most people👀

Well. That was unexpected. I gasped when Dalinar took the sword because i almost forgot in the moment that he had stormlight! This makes sense now. He wanted a spectacle. Well played indeed Blackthorn.

Hmm. So maybe this thing in his past involved him pulling a similar stunt, but with deadlier consequences?

That sword was almost like a gut punch. Dalinar feels condemned to control by force. When he tries to be different he's rejected but he doesn't want to use his violence to rule over people. It must be so horrible to have people only see you for who you were and not accept you for who you are.

Woahh. That's so cool..spren of the temple crying out to Dalinar.

Omds this is awesome. He's like rebuilding Taln's temple!

Ooh this was such a cool scene of his Bondsmith powers. Idk what his revelation was though. I wonder why he needs Renarin!

Ooh so thats cool. Renarin has progression which im sure i knew but just forgot cus i knew Ym had it and was a truthwatcher. Anyway he heals animate things and Dalinar 'heals' inanimate things. That's cool. So both of them can only 'heal' newly made wounds.

Huh. What's up with Dalinar almost bonding with the family. Something to do with uniting? He can feel people's experiences and empathise but in a supernatural way?

Well it only took just under half the book to convince but we did it! Now we just need Gawx on side. And more Lift!!! Hopefully the focus on the Azish means there will be.

Oof. Any mention of the word passion has me on alert now haha.

Good. Dalinar is trying new methods. This is a big step forward. 

60

Oof. Why does this person worrry about their fellow truthwatchers? Are they in danger, are they betraying people? Such mystery!

Here we go. Moash reunion here we come. Maybe Kal can stop him going down this path!

Oh no. Not this silly triangle again. Stop daydreaming about her Kal!!!

Omds Syl. STOPPPPPPPP! No Mating!!

Hahaha missing boots!

Oof Shallan shading Captain Kaladin😂😂

I bet the Fused are gonna attack when they arrive. The siege over.

Wow. Another beautiful city. Some fan art about but not much.

Uh oh. I don't like that darkness over the palace. It feels like Odium's power or something 😬

Storming Elhokar. A fool! Gonna get himself killed on this exped.

61

Well that chapter title is very ominous👀

It almost seems like these are written copies of conversations they had in the room. Or maybe just a letter. 

Cool map btw. Sure it will come in handy.

Huh. Is Shallan doing that thing where she has the gem give out the stormlight and she doesn't use her reserves?

Ooh yeah an Unmade. That makes sense. But which one? 

I wonder if Elhokar is being influenced by something to try make him rush in.

Haha Kaladin's scowls. Just like Dalinar!

Shallan's disguises definitely gave me a hearty chuckle lol. Well played. I guess its the calm before the storm here.

Eek. That must be hard for Kal to hear. HIS order is the reason he ended up subjugated to lighteyed authority.

Wow. Elhokar. This is a remarkable sense of self reflection here. It almost sounds as if he doesn't intend to make it out😮

A connection to Urithitu. I suppose its possible considering this was the centre of Alethela.

Huh. Something's changed. And not for the better i don't think.

Highmarshal Azure. Who the heck is that? Sounds like a colour lol. Surely it can't be Vasher in disguise again?! No it's too obvious.

Oh wow. That was a spectacle by the Fused, designed to usher in more refugees to push Kholinar even closer to breaking point. Clever.

Jeez the city really is in a crisis. Only the wealthy have police protecting them.

That description of white sounds like Szeth. But it isn't i don't think. So who?

A festival of Spren with nonsensical order of words? Wtf is going on?!

Huh. An Odium exhaustion spren? 

His tailor lol.

62

So we knew they abandoned the tower. But whyyyyyy?!!

Oh crap. I just realised, the religion of the Passions must be Odium influenced. But there are bridge four members who follow it!!

Oh boy. This is bad. A dark Spren controlling the palace of Kholinar and murdering those who dissent.

Oh no. Oh no Shallan. Not self harming. Oh how awful for her to go through. 

So the Spren in the city are corrupted by the Unmade in control somehow? So how come the Spren in Urithiru weren't like that?

Kaladin is starting to accept himself as a lighteyes. I would say that's a good thing!

But why would the Unmade want their allies killed?!! Ooh i guess it's to encourage the parshmen to fight against the humans!

I wonder when Sadeas' death is gonna come back up as a plot point. Adolin appears to have gotten away with it so far!

Hmm. Hungerspren not twisted? What's up with that eh.

Well, we did hear she was mad before the everstorm I'm pretty sure.

This highmarshal Azure seems the only fella keeping this city together! Just who is he to come out of nowhere and save the city?!

Oh no Shallan. How dirty! Exposing the safehand😂😂

Broken glass eh. I wonder what the relevance of the changes is.

Uh oh. A cult?! Cults are never good lol.

A world ruled by Spren. That sounds awful if its Odium's ones. 

Huh. That's like Ulim isnt it. The spren Kaladin saw as well. Why don't the Fused want people using Fabrials?

Where is Azure getting the food from i wonder?

Ahh that makes sense. Cutting off all contact. But surely that would draw attention to it that every method to communicate cuts off? Catch 22 i guess for the Fused.

Makes sense to send Shallan in. I wonder how Moash and Elhokar will meet. They surely do. I assumed it would be in the palace.

Ooh she's finally revealed to them. Pattern is right. Progress!!

Of course Ishnah knew!

63

Ouch. Squabbling children?! What were they arguing over? The decision for the recreance? The real reveal here is underwater caverns in Aimia!!!! That's what the things are guarding. Man Aimia reallly has my attention now.

What an interesting description of cities. They really are a hodgepodge of people lol. 

Wow and Veil loves the tension! She's all about those secrets and darkness is Veil👀

Man this city is super fucked rn.

What the heck is up with these soldiers? 

Oof this disguises stuff with Shallan is just spiralling isn't it!

Ok this cult and the palace is suuuper creepy right now.

I feel like this bronze statue has some relevance. Some ancient figure. A radiant maybe?

Oh man this is super messed up. One of her personalities likes Adolin and one likes Kaladin. Very tangled.

An unmade that can change the structure of buildings?

Woah so even WITHIN the same species of Spren some are weird and some arent. What the heck is going on? I'm just mega lost rn lol. I mean i know whats going on in the plot but i don't have a clue what all of it means and why its happening!

Woahhhhhh. Mate..wtf. my mouth is open. I didn't expect them to run her through. Omds. I shouldn't be so suprised but i really am!

Are these soldiers under mind control of some sort? 

Is that the Spren Elhokar was seeing in mirrors maybe?

Ewwww ewww so disgusting. Yuck. Rotten bodies.

Man Shallan really has some messed up tendencies. She's gonna burst at the end of this book. A water balloon of trauma. And its so sad because its so realistic that is the way some people deal with it. Early on I could see myself becoming frustruated but now its actually very interesting. 

Kaladin Stormblessed! Stay away from that area!

Aww no!! Its back to Dalinar. Storm you Sandersonnnnnn!!!!

64

Man it seems things got real bad between the orders huh.

I knew the Honorblade would come back! I thought he'd be assassinated with it but not yet!

Wow. Just goes to show how diluted the mythology has become that they are Heralds of many things. The truth is lost.

I knew there was something up with that guy! So now we have Nale and Ishi runnint around mad. Oh and Taln. Brilliant🙄

Damn the Stormfather is so begrudging with information. How can he know it forever but only AFTER he's got the powers?!

Man I'm super excited to see who the other two Bondsmiths will be.

The siblings. Huh. But isn't Cultivation his sibling? Who else would it be?

Ooh so whenever the power of Honor can be in one place it can get power from the spiritual realm and give stormlight to gemstones? So basically during a highstorm if you're there and outside of one if you're not in the middle of the storm. I do believe this is some of the most info we have gotten on the Spiritual realm since barely anything is known of it!

Ooh clever that. Now they can carry on training!

Yeahhhh i think its a good idea Rock and not Teft took it tbh. Poor Teft. I hope he recovers fully.

Ooh more Lift hopefully!!

Three of what eh? 

Aww Navani is clearly enamoured. It is cute to see. Though it does feel a little one sided sometimes.

Ooh morse code via Spanreed. I like it!

Hahaha swallowing spheres. Man these people wanna be radiants real bad.

This reminds me, when is Zahel coming back?! I also wanna see Sword Nimi!

Always storming Sadeas. Amaram surely the behind the scenes instigator of it. These men have to be dealt with. I dont think its the thrill. T suggested the thrill had moved on. They're just sadistic twats.

Ooh hey Jasnah! Haven't seen you in a bit!

Yayy Lift will be in this woop!

Here we go. Been waiting on this one for a while!

65

Sounds like it could be a Windrunner complaining about Skybreaker rules!

I'd like to hope its a sign of respect the saphires lit the wall but i really don't know. 

Oof. Just what the heck is on those papers?!

Yeah come on Stormfather! You have Connection!!

Well that was just plain awkward 😂 who holds onto someone like that?! Surely a more natural way lol.

Oof how scandalous these Azish women are!!!

Well. This is certainly the PERFECT way to reach the Azish! Essays not force! Haha brilliant. And four of them!!!

Yess! Finally. This is how it went with Fen. A small inroad.

Omds imagine if one of the Heralds themselves sided with the Voidbringers. That would be reallll bad. I love the global aspect of this book. You really start to sense the greater world and what's really at stake here. But not done in an infodumpy confusing way. Layered.

Ha what Dalinar? Darkeyes had rights? Somebody forgot to tell most of em that😂👀

Hmm. Its played as humerous but there's something to the parshmen actions being related to culture. 

Yayy Lift is here! We love Lift.

Lol tight butt and snots a lot. Kinda freaky to have a dead man's finger like that. I'm guessing they won't let Dalinar to see Gawx but he'll get something.

Oh wow. They've now got most of the region involved. Amazing!

Oof. Glad Dalinar's reveal of the platform didn't ruin anything!

Oh my days. Here we go. We're finally gonna find out what happened to Evi. And it sounds horrific.

66

Nice to see Dalinar paying attention to his son now!

Wow. Its eerie how indoctrinated Adolin is.

Omds. That line about liberally murdering opponents really shook me. How callous. Wow.

I suspect Gavilar has started to find the Way of Kings with his mention of revelations.

Man he's definitely gonna kill that king kid isnt he.

1407,"Okay. First of all I know I’m insane.

So, Odium has to have a plan and since voidlight operates separate to stormlight, (seemingly), maybe Fused do not require the same means of accumulating stormlight as a radiant would.

What I'm getting at is, what if Odium's plan is to get Dalinar into an oathpact without Dalinar realizing this would neutralize the Stormfather's recycling of stormlight on Roshar.
And if not that specific way, what if Odium has a plan to neutralize stormlight recycling.

So that Radiants cannot heal, they cannot surgebind, and they become regular soldiers.

This would make a good reason for why Cultivation made Lift as she is. She can accumulate stormlight regardless of what system she is in, and regardless of the system all you need is to fucking feed her and she gets stormlight. 

So it would make a good reason for why Brandon says Lift takes on a more important part like Kaladin or Dalinar in the latter half.

Moving on through that, how would the heroes fix the stormlight neutralization?

Well.. turns out there is an object that has been collecting immense amounts of investiture for thousands of years - Nightblood. What if the way to fix it, and again making Szeth very relevant in the latter half, is Nightblood agreeing with Szeth to destroy him and release his investiture across Roshar?

As far as I know, he is not confirmed as a member of the 17th shard. I bring up this point as a reason to discuss his absurd age and the possible reasons for it. It would seem that, for some reason or other, the members of the 17th shard are somehow insulated from the effects of aging. If Felt is not a member, though, there is unique room for speculation about him.


One theory I have not seen posited: it has also been confirmed that there is at least one kandra on Roshar, and we know they do not die of age. Is it possible Felt is, or always has been, a kandra? Would this have been a potential spy for Harmony to learn of the other shards? Based on his conversation with Dalinar it seems likely he attempted to speak with Cultivation, and if he remains around he could be gathering intel on Odium as well.

First off, I do not won the books, I am a plebian audiobook listener, but I have done so 3 times. What I can tell from my first *listent*hrough is, that I had a hard time to follow where people were in the world. Especially in OB since I finished WoR \~6months earlier. 

Do you guys think it would be a good idea if such an official interactive map would be online somewhere and in the book it tells you, ""hey, go to this site there you can find a Map with all the characters location per chapter"".

I for example liked pausing the audio book and looking up on some map online where x location is. I think an interactive map would help get people immersed, because not everyone is interested in searching for some 3pt province name for each interlude.

Oof these Spren look super weird.

Interesting that they have only had one bondsmith. Just like Dalinar now. Was this the start of Honor splintering into Stormfather i wonder. And armed with my new find thanks to commenters i can say this is a Skybreaker. 

Wow. What a sentence to open a chapter with😂

There goes my theory it was the thing Elhokar was seeing in the mirrors. He would've said. But his drawing impressed Shallan. Maybe it was a Lightweaver spren he was seeing?

Gavinor. Cool name. Doesn't it mean son of or something. I feel like Dalinar mentioned it back in his flashback what nor stood for. Nice callback though.

This cult is just dammed weird. Kinda creeps me out tbh.

Nice plan Elhokar. I like that. Transport the cult to Urithiru. Solid.

Oh Elhokar. He doesn't want to believe what is so obvious. When he has to confront it it's gonna be sad.

What happened to them you ask Veil? They were murdered! I wonder if this new lighteyed house is involved in some way.

Haha. I love the line about moneylenders having a sixth sense about danger. So true.

A sugary meat stick? Yuck. Who puts sugar and meat together?!

Storming incompetent corrupt lighteyes soldiers!

Oof i thought it was soulcast but forgot that that brings in the Fused. Hmm that is a mystery how they get it then.

Yayy Wit! I been waiting for this!

I wonder if thats something from lightweaving or from warbreaker. Could be either imo, or none!

I'm sure we've heard about Mishim earlier on. Someone made reference. Let me look. This is when ebooks are handy!

Yessss! It was Sigzil who said she was the cleverest! And the Natanatan queen turned blue cus she swapped places and now they're all blue!

This reminds me of the tower of Babel story in the bible. Reminiscent of trying to reach the heavenly domain by building great towers.

Definitely Yolish lightweaving. I wonder why it manifested itself both on Yolen and Roshar. Even though they are slightly different. 

Ah very clever Mishim. Appealing to human vanity!

I assume Hoid can see through Veil because he's a lightweaver too.

Well. Hoid was certainly a better storyteller than Sigzil lol. 

Oh wow the flute! I forgot about that. Didn't Kaladin have it?

Oof. Taldain sand!


68

What is the Sibling? This really is a mystery since as far as i was concerned it was only the three shards! Had to look up the herald cus i didnt know which order it was, Elsecaller. Reading it again it does sound like a scholar like Jasnah.

Typical Wit.

People worship Hoid?! That's hillarious. I need to hear THAT story!

Wait Yolen was once a sea? Or am i just looking into too much here?

Nice convo about stupidity. I always enjoy Wit's convos. 

Interesting he didn't know of Sadeas' death.

Ha Wit a spren! He'd get a good laugh out of that.

Wit is unusually sincere in this conversation it seems. People who think they have control of change scare him a lot. People like Rayse.

Ooh info about the cult! So it IS an unmade. The heart of the Revel. I wonder what it's true name is, and what group the cult reminds Wit of? There are so many groups in the Cosmere it could be any. Maybe the 17th shard?

Oof why is he here then?!

Huh. Feels like a spren. Curious.

69

Another Elsecaller! Sounds like Urithiru was falling apart!

Eek! A risky experiment. But, i think, neccessary.

Interesting. So not quite the same as the ones Kaladin was with.

I wonder what the full reason is the lightweaving doesn't attract the spren. Pattern says it isnt as 'noisy' but does it actually emit noise?

Typical Adolin!

Feels like a throwback to their WoR relationship with the quips!

Yayy small steps! Adolin drinking with bridgemen shows progress!

Nice to see Kaladin's struggles still going on as would be true to life, but on the up since he returned home!

When is our friend Zahel coming back?!!!

Aww Kal. Cute, he's reached a good stage with Adolin!

Ooh yes, let's find out about this Azure person. Ally or frenemy i wonder. I doubt foe.

Well that was unexpected! Lets go find out about Azure! Though i hope the other disguises hold up better or it'll be a disaster. I suspect the illusion didn't work because Kaladin's perception of himself is too strong to last.

70

So, what's happening to the Sibling! I assume they think its to do with radiant divisions since the Sibling is bondsmith related? Nothing else to say tbh.

Nice to see Syl show up again but the spren playing a bigger role really is the one thing that has been missing so far. Let's hope this is remedied later on.

Beard seems like an interesting fella. Would like to hear his stories sometime.

This Azure fella sounds very interesting. A mysterious shardbearer just happens to turn up to save them all. Who is he really?

A woman shardbearer named after a colour with an unusual 'otherworldly' sword. Is this Vivenna? Vasher and her seemed to be about to set off together at the end of Warbreaker. Somehow Nightblood and Vasher ended up here!

Whoever voices Azure in the GA, is doing a terrible Scottish accent btw😂

I made a post about three weeks ago about potentially starting a writing prompt style weekly post. Because Roshar is already so well fleshed out and detailed, I figured it would be neat for us fans to create more stories in the world (even Brandon can't cover everything intersting in 10 books)!

Ideally, if you respond to more than one each response will be a different top-level comment. Also, if you wouldn't mind, please spoiler flag your comments so people can know which comments they can read.

I will also be leaving a top level comment for people to give feedback, have discussions about the prompts, etc. I would appreciate if we leave other top level comments for responses to the prompts!

2. During Kaladins time at bridge four, what purpose does the ""vengeance pact"" actually serve? Why are the gemhearts valuable? - Might answer my next question... 
3. What do we know about soul casting? Why is it done at night almost in a secret kind of fashion? Who do the soul casters work for really? Why are they still loyal to Gavilar after his death? 
4. In Dalinars vision where he has to attack a ""voidbringer"" with a fire poker... what was that thing.  Or better yet what WERE those things? Creatures of an Unmade? Dalinar asks the Radiant and they respond by saying they were creatures of Darkness.... so what is a creature of darkness? 
5. Lastly this is something Ive wondered since first reading the books years ago... Is it just coincidence that Taln gave up at the same time the desolation was creeping up. Are those two things tied together? For instance: If Taln could have held out another 400 years, would Kaladin and others have started learning their surges? Would spren have been as active?

1454,"Okay, so we have this section from the end of chapter 4:

 

&gt;In her name, Veil tried again. “I don’t know if waiting is wise,” she said to the others as the tall man prepared to replace her sack. “You should know, I have connections to Dalinar Kholin’s inner circle. I can feed you information about his plans, if I’m properly incentivized.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“There will be time for that,” the woman said. “Later.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Don’t you want to know what he’s planning?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“We already know,” the man said, chuckling. “We have a source far closer to him than you.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Wait.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Shallan came alert. They had someone near Dalinar? Perhaps they were lying, but… could she risk that?  
&gt;  
&gt;*We need to do something,* she thought. If Ialai had an operative in Dalinar’s inner circle, it could be life-threatening. They didn’t have time for Veil to slowly infiltrate her way to the top. They needed to know who this informant was *now.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Veil stepped back, letting Shallan take over. Radiant could fight, and Veil could lie. But when they needed a problem solved quickly, it was Shallan’s turn.

I absolutely loved this hook! Who could possibly be the source? Obviously, the Sons of Honor here don't necessarily know they're talking to Shallan. So whoever they're talking about doesn't necessarily have to be incredibly close to Dalinar.

But what if they are?

Here's my theory: Shallan, along with some help from Veil, Radiant, Pattern, and Adolin, will spend most of the book trying to figure out who this informant is. She'll follow clues, repeatedly getting super close to finding the source, and then lose them completely.

Why?

Because the source *is* Shallan! Think about it. Shallan has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). We regularly interact with her three personalities now and they regularly interact with each other. But, that's not always the way DID works. Sometimes personalities exist who are not aware of each other and sometimes one is aware of another when the other is not aware of the one.

What if a part of Shallan really doesn't think Dalinar is the man for the job? What if she (he/they) met Ialai and appreciated her intelligence and saw the potential great things she could do as Queen? And what if Shallan, Veil, and Radiant have no clue they exist?

If this theory is correct, we can probably expect to see gaps in her memory. Things regularly not adding up. Maybe we'll see Veil and Radiant give some space for Shallan to spend time with Adolin and then the 4th personality will take over after a bit. Perhaps Adolin will start receiving some mixed signals all while the main 3 personalities think Shallan is being perfectly clear with him.

This seems like exactly the type of thing Sanderson could pull off and if it's what he ends up doing, I'm sure he's thought of multiple other clever things to do with it. I hope I'm right, but regardless, Sanderson has already captivated me with this book and I'm excited to see where he takes it.",Stormlight_Archive,Spoilers for Row Chapters 4 and 5: A theory about the end of chapter 4 of RoW
1455,"I haven't been able to find any WoBs, information, or theories that relate Oathgates to the cymatic patterns of their host cities. Has there been any speculation in this direction?

Oathgates are, as far as I can ascertain, only found in Dawncities. While no cities are officially Dawncities, we know that they are all very old and all have cymatic patterns. All the Oathgate-containing cities that we have maps of have cymatic patterns, with the exception of the destroyed city in the Shattered Plains. Are there any cities that we know of with cymatic patterns that DO NOT have an Oathgate?

Could the cymatic patterns be a byproduct of the construction of the Oathgates?

Both Elsecallers and Willshapers share the surge of Transportation, which is what Oathgates utilize. However, Willshapers also have the surge of Cohesion. During the construction of the Oathgates, the Willshapers could have liquified the nearby land (whether intentionally or not), and a vibration (perhaps related to DawnSINGers) would have caused the cymatic pattern. The liquification of the land could also have been caused by a slight temporary merging of the Physical realm and the Cognitive realm, where solid land is beads. This could mean Willshapers have the ability to reduce the Cohesion between the Physical and Cognitive realms.

Willshapers are also known to build infrastructure. That would include cities and transportation between cities. This perfectly fits their M.O.

One interesting note is that these were all planned cities. Whatever caused the cymatic patterns would have been extremely destructive to anything that was there at the time, so people would have moved in after that event.

Cymatic patterns form relative to the shape of the surface that is vibrating. That means the Oathgate need not be at the center of the cymatic pattern, only that it needs to be somewhere on the surface that was vibrating. However, it is suspicious that the cymatic patterns are radially symmetrical, this implies that the liquified surface was also radially symmetrical, with the same center as the cymatic pattern. This is odd since Oathgates are not centered upon the cymatic pattern, which is the biggest hole for this theory. It's possible that the Oathgates, due to mechanical reasons, were placed at the edge of the vibrating surface. Maybe the Oathgate platform was built like a raft, then floated on the liquified surface until it reached the edge of the surface, and that's where it ended up??

1466,"So spoilers through Oathbringer.  I'm about to start the chapters for RoW that have been released, so these might contradict my theories.

Based on what I've seen, it sounds like the Heralds fell because of corruption from Odium.  I read that as he somehow that bound his soul to theirs.  In doing so, it created the 9 unmade, one for each Herald that defected.  I speculate that the more powerful the unmade, the less sane the Herald.

When Dalinar is told ""Unite them"", this is in reference (at least partially) to the Heralds needing to be united with their splintered self.

When Moash stabs Jezrien, I think that is not actually killing him.  But rather trapping him in a sort of ""reverse"" fabrial.  This would trap a man instead of a spren.  By doing this Odium hopes to prevent team Dalinar from having access to the Herald to unite his soul.  This is similar to how it is described to trap a spren for eternity in a fabrial at other parts of Oathbringer.

Reading this made a thought coalesce in my head, that there is a ton of overlap in the mythos of the tranquiline halls with Fused.

Currently I am rereading WoR and I have been thinking for a while that something does not fit me in the relationship between these two little birds.
 
I would like, before entering the core, to give a little background about my doubt and then I will tell you to see what you think.
 
About half of WoR, when Shallan is beginning to discover her powers she realizes that her illusions cannot make sound and Patron tells her that before she could. Then he insists that she has to remember and face her past and Shallan, apart from refusing to remember because she does not want to be a silent girl hidden in a corner again, asks him if she had done it before why can't he explain the process. Patron explains that for a long time he lost his memory and that there is much he does not remember. At the time I assumed that this memory loss was due to the transfer of his consciousness to the Physical Realm but now I think it is due to a weakening of his bond due to Shallan's shock and how he handled the trauma (of having killed her mother). The bond was weakened until the TWoK events.
 
We know that all the Knight Radiance were broken in some way. So if Shallan had bonded with Patron and developed powers (much more than up until that point in the book) before killing her mother (which is theoretically what broke her); What had ""broken"" her in the first instance?",Stormlight_Archive,Question about Shallan's relationship with Patron.

1484,"I've been seeing a lot of posts on social media about human trafficking and all of the truly awful acts that fall in that category. I usually end up thinking, ""if there were ever a place for a Windrunner..."". This lead me down a rabbit hole of wondering what radiants would be working towards if they existed in the world we live in and I came up with the list below. I'm sure my viewpoint is biased towards my culture and environment (Southeastern U.S.), so I was wondering what everyone else thought?     
    
Windrunners - As stated above - protecting the powerless from human trafficking and other forms of exploitation.    
    
Skybreakers - Lots of demands for justice out there. The one that seems the most skybreaker-y to me is the lack of resources available for public defenders. I could also see them going after certain people in power that flagrantly break laws but have millions to spend on attorneys.     
    
Dustbringers - I feel like Dustbringers would fit in well with the hacker/anonymous/wikileaks folk. Being skilled with computers is almost a super power these days already, and requires a certain proclivity to pull things apart and see how they work.     
    
Edgedancers - I don't think this group's mission would really change that much. Providing food and healing for those in need is sorely needed in amost every society of which I'm aware.    
    
Truthwatchers - Reporters and philosophers. Wouldn't it be nice to have a group of people bound by magic so that they couldn't lie... oh wait, the Wheel of Time already kinda disproved that... but still!
    
Lightweavers - Spycraft and movies. Sorry, Lucasarts, but CG just isn't worth it when Lightweavers can create illusions at will. I considered them as reporters/bloggers. But I think having a malleable relationship with their oaths would mess up the reliability of their reporting.    
    
Elsecaller - Scholars and politicians. Put an Elsecaller on the ballot in November (and let me see their spren) and they've got my vote. I've also had a few tenured professors that were brilliant but may or may not be willing to give real world ""philosophy"" lessons. 
    
Willshapers - I think the ACLU and Libertarian camps would have a strong presence of Willshapers. But that's not to say most willshapers would be in those groups... I could actually see a lot of engineers/contractors as willshapers. ""Let me design, build, create, etc. and don't give me a dress code""     
    
Stonewards - Military recruits, pro athletes, and everyone that somehow works their marathon/spartan race/recent hiking trip into the first five minutes of every interaction.    
    
Bondsmiths - Can we really only have three?!? I think the limited number of these would kind of grant fame/power to anyone able to bond the specific spren. Obviously this would have implications for a global political order beyond the scope of this post's ""sandbox"", but Bondsmiths would certainly have their work cut out for them to work against rising nationalist policies...

1487,"Something I've been thinking of the last couple days is the importance of numbers within the series. We know that the number 10 holds significance on Roshar similar to the way that 16 was important on Scadriel. There were 10 heralds, 10 orders of knights radiant, 10 silver kingdoms, 10 months in a year, and so on and so forth. Odium however has a different association with the number 9. His champion is shown as having 9 shadows, there are 9 types of void surges, 9 unmade, and I'm sure more to come.  


What is interesting to me is how this parallels with numbers in the Bible. In the bible, the number 7 is associated with divinity, completion, and perfection. 7 days in the creation, 7 churches in the book of revelation, 7 seals held by angels, and many more I'm sure I missed. The number 6 however is related to imperfection, shortcoming, and sin. Most notably in ""the number of the beast"" 666. The significance of this is that 666 is to connote eternally damned, progression is halted short of perfection, to be forever in sin.  


To circle it back to why we are all here, I find it interesting that Odium is associated with the number 9 considering he is shattering other shards in an attempt to become the sole shard remaining (at least if I understand his intention correctly). Odium then in this case, is striving for his own form of completion though he is currently shy of it. While we know Honor is not perfection, I don't think perfection exists without Adonalsium as the whole entity of every shard, Honor is who we are supposed to see on Roshar as ""The Almighty"" and the closest thing to god that they have.   


Long story short, 6 in bible could be equivalent to 9 in SA and 7 in bible with 10.",Stormlight_Archive,Numerology in the SA
1488,"We've known Kaladin's opinion on lighteyes since the very beginning of his character, and I thought it was quite odd at first how quickly he adapted to being called a brightlord, but I've been thinking, and here's my prediction for the last 5 books: Kaladin is going to take a more Dalinar-esque role, and I am guessing Dalinar is going to die.

My reasons:

1) Kaladin has changed and adapted very well into a leadership role, as well as that of a lighteyes.

2) There are many parallels between their characters, which I believe may be foreshadowing.

It really surprised my that Kaladin didn't react so much when people call him ""Brightlord"", it seems like something he'd really be against, but I think he is (or is going to be) okay with this change. He is obviously internally conflicted about it, but we haven't seen him outwardly show that he is uncomfortable. He also didn't object at all to Dalinar promising him a fairly large amount of land due to his status as 4th dahn.

This obviously isn't quite enough evidence, but he also is starting to use his status to his advantage. For example, showed off the Sylblade to brightlord Roshone, as well as doing the same when recruiting the wall guard.

Him adapting to a leadership position is almost certain IMO, especially since we're starting to see bridge 4's perspective of him. I think those chapters in particular show that he is now seperate from the soldiers, even the squires who see him as an inspiration and a leader. We also know that Kaladin is prepared to act as a lighteyes, since we saw in a flashback that he wanted to be called Kaladin, not Kal. This makes me believe he will do as Dalinar did, he will try to restore honour to the ruling class to be like that of what he imagined.

As for the parallels, here are a few examples:

1) Both were about to kill their king, but barely decided against it at the last moment. Dalinar at the battle for the Rift and Kaladin when he joined Moash's plot to kill Elhokar.

2) Both failed to protect said king, which resulted in their death.

3) Both loved a woman which they could not have. Dalinar loved Navani, and Kaladin loved the wife of Brightlord Roshone (although he clearly hated her after the incident where she tried to order him around).

4) Both were betrayed by their friends/allies. Dalinar was betrayed by Sadeas, who he went to war with together, and began to trust again. Dalinar was also betrayed by Amaram, who he was good friends with. Kaladin was obviously betrayed by Moash.

5) Both ended up breaking their oaths / acting dishonourably at one point. When Kaladin did it, Syl temporarily died, I would say Dalinar did this at the Rift.

I'm sure there are many more than this which I have not mentioned yet, but it seems to me that Kaladin will be the Dalinar of the back 5 books, so I assume Dalinar will die in book 5 or so. Either way Kaladin is certainly going to become more of a large-scale leader rather than a front line soldier, perhaps succeeding Dalinar as High King of Urithiru or leader of the Knights Radiant. I hope I'm wrong, and that Dalinar survives the whole series, technically there's no reason he should die because of this, but it would make sense to me to remove one character if there are two very similar ones.

It would make sense to have Kaladin become the leader of the ""next generation"" of knights radiant after Dalinar passes. I'm not too sure what this means beside Kaladin becoming a less active character in the future, or if Dalinar will die, and I'm interested to hear everyone else's thoughts on what these connections could mean, since I am just guessing here, I'm sure Brandon has some surprises up his sleeve.

My main criticisms are that it felt like one long prologue, which, given the significant content of the narrative, probably could have been told in maybe half or two-thirds the number of pages.

The thing that bothered me was how fundamental aspects the world and other details that should be course for the characters living in their environment are not mentioned at the first opportunity but are added later. As the reader, I had the impression that the world worked in one way, only to have to changed later. It made me think that Sanderson came up with these ideas well into drafting the manuscript, but forgot to go back and add them to the earlier parts. 

The most egregious examples, in my opinion, had to do with Essences, Callings, and Old Magic. These elements were introduced more than half way into the book despite the fact they were relevant to the story and the reader's understanding of the world from near the beginning, especially the first two. 

There are also minor things like the woman Kaladin remembers at one point, who he conveniently had not thought of for years, or the markets outside Sedeas' war camps that had better quality goods, something that might come up when a Horneater is discussing his culinary arts.

We found out in OB that Szeth had trained with all ten surges, and he's clearly really really good with them. I don't think we know yet if the training took place before or after he was declared Truthless but there's something funny going on in either case.


If he trained before- Shin believe the Radiants aren't coming back, and they're super against weapons, so why teach them how to use the powers of the Heralds? 


If he trained after- What?? ""We're going to exile you, with one of the weapons of a son of God, and make you very very good at using those powers to accomplish anything.

Shallan is a parshwoman. 

This theory is just formulating in my head now after reading the chapter so its a bit of a jumbled mess, but basically here it is.

These are some things we learn in chapter 9:

1. Shallan is just as fake as veil and radiant and not the first personality, there is a ""non"" personality called the formless.

You know who else are considered formless? Parshmen by the parshendi, this choice of wording is too much to be a coincidence IMO

2. The next truth she needs to reveal to herself is so severe she believes everyone in her life will turn on her, even pattern. 

What truth could be so bad that she believes Pattern would leave her? She thinks the singers are the enemy, if she was one she may think pattern would leave her.

I think this could be related but may not be:

Shallan doesnt talk for months after killing her mother, could this not just be her shutting down, but also because we know parshmen have a harder time speaking.


I think Shallan was a parshwoman slave to the Davars who bonded a spren, somewhere along the line she kills the real shallan (or she just dies) and Parshallan takes her place. How? I dont think it could be simple lightweaving as we have seen her run out of stormlight (unless she lies about that as well but its unlikely).

 Stay with me here this is very out there, she uses the healing granted by her bond with pattern to effectively turn into a human, at least in appearance.

We know that healing restores a person to the way they perceive themselves, so Kaladin heals with his brands, and Brandon has said that trans people would transition.

What if after Human Shallan died it completely broke Parshallan and to cope she adopted Shallan's personality completely. She sees herself as Shallan Davar the human, her original self is the formless singer, hence the ""formless"" moniker.

I think this could be revealed and be the straw that breaks the camels back in many issues.

Many are also theorizing that the windrunners will break away from the rest of the radiants as kal gets more and more unsure of killing singers, what if shallan gets revealed and people turn on her, that could spur Kaladin to side with her. This in turn could throw a new wrench in the Kaladin/Shallan/Adolin love triangle that is almost certainly unresolved with two books left to go and too many feelings left unsaid between Kaladin and Shallan.


I will try to organize this better and start a new reread to look for more hints, I will try and update before RoW.

1529,"In case you guys don't remember, Brandon wrote for a hack and slash video game for iOS some years back. The game is gone now, but I think the premise would work really well for the Stormlight Archive. 

A hack and slash mobile game featuring Shardplates and Shardblades, where the premise is to duel other Shardbearers and collect as many Blades and Plates as you can. Maybe even have Chasmfiends as event bosses or something. 

Even cooler still would be incorporating The Knights Radiants' power. An Edgedancer can slow down time to mimic their fast speed, a Lightweaver can create false imagery to trick their opponents, Skybreakers and Windrunners can perform amazing acrobatic supermoves.

There could even be a rather morbid mini game, where a Shardbearer slashes down waves of enemy Fruit Ninja style. Miss one and they shatter a piece of your armor. 

As for the plot itself, I would want Brandon to handle it. Or at the very least someone he trusts. I don't know what happened to the developers of Infinity Blade but I do hope that they can be on board for this project.

One guy (Talanel/Taln) died and is in a place that sounds like a messed-up purgatory. They want to break the Oathpact. Guys are tired of dying and getting tortured all the time. I gets it.

# Prologue

Hey, hey people. Szeth here. Alright, so power is stored in these gems and while most people find mundane uses for them, Szeth can draw upon their energy for power. Got it. Lashing is the application of this power. If it sounds like, and feels like gravity manipulation, then... it's grav manip. So it looks like people picked up them shardblades left behind by the 10. I wonder about the mechanics of the soulbinding. This King’s death sounds like it'll be something super complicated.

# Part 1

I am getting heavy Thanatonaut vibes from these death quotes. So we meet our young and plucky protag. I’m thinking racism here is determined by eye color. So we have lost our young and plucky protag? Kaladin was the real protag all along! Appears he comes from a family of doctors. Spren are fae-like spirits. Shallan enters the scene. She sounds like a bright-eyed college freshman. I like the quippiness though. Kharbranth sounds like a nice city. I like bells. Men don’t read!? I don’t know why, but this bugs me a lot more than it should. So hiding a hand is considered proper, cute. Jasnah the heretic, eh? Also, Shal is having family troubles. Sad Kal is sad. 19 years old? Younger than I thought. And to the warfront they go. I like. Jasnah sounds great. Aaand Shallan rejected. Steal the soulcaster? Well, well. She's not so innocent after all. 

Gotta remember that parshmen and Parshendi are different. I am very confused about how these bridges work. Research shall need to be done on my side. Brutal work, these bridge runs. Shallan is an artist. A damn good one it seems. Possibly empowered somehow. Ardents are a religious people? Like missionaries? Ah, priests. I like Kabsal. A bit too lax for his own good though. Oho! cheeky Shal, you go girl! And so, we see Shallan taking no guff haha. YALB YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD! ‘His wife glared at him’ Good! Oh, looks like there are multiple moons in this world. Nomon, the middle moon. Vengeance pact? For killing King Galivar I assume.   
Noo, don’t leave little sprite! Death and Rotspren hate water. I like these little things that show how the doctors know to wash their hands before performing any medical procedure. Radiants sound like the prelude group. Kal’s dad seems like a good dad. Definitely a good dad. Saved enough to pay for his son’s education. Kal has had enough of Gaz. Looks like a change in leadership is in order!

Ishikk  
These lake people sound super chill. Haha, definitely living on that island time.I wonder who the men are hunting. I doubt it's the assassin.

Nan Balat  
This guy has undiagnosed issues. Initial impression: Shallan’s family is real piece of work.

Glory of Ignorance  
Our boy Szeth is back. So he is bound to people holding his stone. Man, that sucks.

# Part 2

*It is from this part onward that I really started getting sucked into the story so my note taking ends up dropping off.*

Dalinar is a badass. I love the growth from both Kal and Syl. So exciting. The King’s Wit. What an interesting fellow. It’s good for Dalinar’s oldest son to see that the interpersonal relationships between his father and Sadeas isn’t as clear cut as he originally thought. Ooh, a real-life death rattle…prophecy? The prophecy makes sense, also they are waging war for these resources but they must serve some sort of purpose. Shinovar fauna and flora is like our Earth then. Got it.   


The Queen is so into Dalinar. He is into her too but I understand his apprehension.  
BUT FUCK THAT! YEAHHHHHH GO DALI!

Damn, so Kabsal was a baddie the whole time. Poor Shal. Everything falling to pieces around her.

Yo WTF SADEAS!

SHAL DID WHAT!? Cold. Blooded. 

THE KING IS BEHIND THAT!?

Shal dad was a cultist. Dali didn’t realize that his vision guide was just voice mail. And Taln, once again, late to the party. Good lord. I *am* glad that Kal isn't writing off Dalinar entirely. I hope he ends up being the one to save Dalinar from Szeth's attempt.

I have to say that I am utterly and completely sucked into this. The amount of cliffhangers that were packed in to that last section is unreal. It felt like I was watching a show more than reading. Initially, I read up to Jasnah letting Shallan join her due to Shal's insistence but I spent the last 2 days reading through the rest of the book. Even at work. This is looking to be a great series.   


I'll be starting Stormbreaker sometime this week.",Stormlight_Archive,Read The Way of Kings and wrote some notes and thoughts as I went
1539,"First of all, let's stablish how stromlight works. We all see stormlight as a source of power and magic for Radiant Knights to use, and we can assume it is used the same way as metals on Mistborn. Kaladin, Shallan and as far as I know any other Radiant use terms as ""consume"" or ""waste"" when talking about stormlight. At the end of Oathbringer, when Shallan creates hundreds of light illusions to create an army, Jasnah many times says how much stormlight she is using. This and how Kaladin refers to it when launching himself leads to think that stormlight would be used as a ""currency"" that you can exchange for the use of the different powers Radiant Knights have. At least, this is how I always imagined stormlight being used.

However, a few moments ago I was reading the first chapter of WoK, where Szeth kills Gavilar. Well, there's an instance when Szeth introduces the use of stormlight by absorbing it from the lamps on the walls of the palace, right before fighting the two guards, and he talks about how he maintains stormlight on his body. He speaks about how humans are not able to perfectly keep stormlight on their bodies as they're a porous recipient. And then he mentions the Voidbringers, which are said to be perfect containers for stormlight, preventing it from leaking.

In the case of the Voidbringers, assuming that the void light that they use instead works the same as stormlight, it would make sense how they're able to have ""infinite"" void light. It's not actually infinite, it's just that it's not leaking. 

Szeth does a thing when using stormlight that I don't remember any other character explicitly doing (it's been a year and a half since I started reading the first book so there might be a thousand scenes when someone does this). On this first scene, Szeth purposefully keeps his mouth closed while retaining stormlight. Right after the narrator says that he is doing it, it comes the phrase about how humans are unable to retain stormlight for too much. This implies that keeping his mouth closed is related to how stormlight is retained on the human body: if he closes it he can retain it more time. We are also told about how Szeth keeps his mouth closed during the whole fight, until he kills the last guard, when the narrator specifically says how Szeth lets his breath out. We also can deduct that Szeth is not only keeping his mouth closed but he's also not breathing at all. At some point on Oathbringer we see another character (sorry, I don't remember - _-' ) doing this exact thing, you can indefinitely stop breathing as long as you have stormlight.

Here's were it starts to come together. Szeth is constantly trying to retain stormlight as much as possible, and to do that he chooses not to breath. However, if he's not breathing, he's constantly healing himself, with stormlight. Szeth is choosing to keep stormlight from leaking instead of actually using it. On this case, Szeth would be wasting stormlight just by healing himself from not breathing, being completely counterproductive. Now, I know that Szeth might not be completely aware about how his powers work as he doesn't even know he can instantly summon his honorblade, so this might not be useful information. 

Well, after thinking about this, I realized that stormlight might not be actually consumed as I used to think. Stormlight is not actually used, it's required to use the powers, but it's not actually being expended. When they run out of stormlight, it's not because they consumed it, but because it's constantly leaking and it ends up running out. 
 
So, is this thing I just said true? Or I'm I just overthinking too much and ignoring certain scenes where this theory becomes completely senseless? I'd like to see any other instance where this is proven correct or wrong. 

If it's true, then what does it mean when Shallan is using more stormlight than usual?

But if it's not true, then what sense does it make that Voidbringers have infinite power source when this thing Szeth said perfectly matches that mystery? And if we just assume that void light works totally different than normal stormlight, then why would Szeth even bother to talk about the way each body works as a stromlight container in the first place? Is this information not true? Then who told it to Szeth and why? Is Szeth pointlessly retaining his breath during that fight? Then, why would he think what he's doing is correct? Did someone lie to him about it? Or is it just that there's a difference of how actual Radiant Knights and those who obtain the abilities from honorblades understand their powers, making Szeth unable to correctly recognize how stormlight works unlike other Radiants? 

I don't know, thinking that what Szeth said about humans and Voidbringers just points out a little detail that's not relevant as stormlight is being consumed the same way by each one is really strange. But then again, I might be overthinking too much. By the way, is there a scene where we see a human retaining stormlight without using it instead of carrying infused spheres? Because in that case we would we able to see if it's being consumed at the same rate or not. If it's just leaking and there's no consumption then it would run out at the same speed all the time. Would it change between each person and depending on what if it's the case? If all this is true, then I don't know what's happening to Shallan at the end of Oathbringer. 

Anyways, once we know how Heralds use stormlight, about Szeth's past or we actually receive an explanation about why Voidbringers have infinite power source, I might be able to know if this thing I talked about makes a bit of sense or not. In the meantime, does anyone remember any scene to contrast all this? 


By the way, sorry if I was avoiding certain terms, I read the books on Spanish and I don't know how these terms were translated. For example, I was calling Voidbringers to the parshendi that are bounded to a voidspren even if I know they're not actually Voidbringers. In Spanish, they're called the Fused ones...? or something like that, being translated? I don't know, so I apologize if I was irritatingly avoiding using some names.",Stormlight_Archive,I noticed a thing about how Radiant Knights use stormlight after re-reading the first chapter of Szeth. (I'm not sure about it though)
1541,"So, &gt;!Shallan still has secrets left that she needs to spill, as most recently indicated in the chapter released this week!&lt;. This leads me into the discussion that I really want to have:

&gt;!Which Unmade was influencing the Davar family?!&lt; From what I can recall, it sounds like they were specifically targeted. There are others, I believe, but here are two pertinent WoBs:[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/332-jordancon-2018/#e9520](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/332-jordancon-2018/#e9520)[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/122-leipzig-book-fair/#e3333](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/122-leipzig-book-fair/#e3333)

My instinct is that it is one of those with which we're currently unfamiliar. Is it Dai-gonarthis? There's the quote gathered from a death rattle that says, ""Let me no longer hurt! Let me no longer weep! Dai-gonarthis! The Black Fisher holds my sorrow and consumes it!"" Could this be the ""magical enhancement"" that Nan Balat feels as he hurts something, soothing the effects on him somehow by this Unmade? Obviously, the death rattles can't be trusted entirely because they're an Unmade-generated phenomena, plus in-world references aren't inherently trustworthy. Or is it Chemoarish? We know practically nothing about her. Could this be why we have no information on her? So that it can be an integral part of her story? There's also no indication that she has been captured, and my instincts seem to say that she's been separated and hush-hush from the others for dramatic thematic reasons. Given that her name is the ""Dustmother"", and that each Unmade roughly corresponds to an Order ([https://wob.coppermind.net/events/173/#e8598](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/173/#e8598)), could the ache soothed by Nan Balat taking it apart be similar to the Dustbringer/Releaser drive to see what's inside?

Looping back to Shallan's secrets... We know that the Unmade are Splinters of Odium, and can possibly be bonded, but Brandon also indicated that such a thing, while plausible, has not occurred. So, it shouldn't be any shenanigans that way, unless Brandon is purposely being very deceitful (reference: [https://wob.coppermind.net/events/80/#e5292](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/80/#e5292)).",Stormlight_Archive,[Minor RoW spoilers] Bad influences on the Davar family
1542,"I just realized a possible foreshadowing that says how the parshmen are originally from Honor and not from Odium.

Let me explain myself. We know from the third book that the actual voidbringers were the humans and they came to Roshar with their god (Odium), so Honor was originally the god from the Parshmen but he leaved them for the humans but they still have an honorable tradition.

In the prologue it is said that the white is to get caught and give the enemy an opportunity to defend themselfs or in other words to give the enemy an honorable fight. So since the first book we're told that Honor is the god from the parshmen and not from the humans. But that's just a theory, a BOOK theory, thanks for reading.

1543,"""I, Adolin Kholin, the cousin of the king. Have shat myself in my shardplate. Three times. All on purpose.""

It's all downhill from here.",Stormlight_Archive,This story peaked in book two.
1546,"So we have Voidlight with Odium, and presumably Stormlight with honor, is there cultivationlight with Cultivation? Or is that just bundled with whatever ""light"" honor originally had and together it makes Stormlight.

While I've got you here, another question. It's mentioned that the highstorms, stormfather, and some lesser spren were already on Roshar before the shattering, does that mean that Roshar contained Big A's investiture, or was that a post Honor and Cultivation's honeymoon thing",Stormlight_Archive,Is there Cultivationlight?
1547,"Hey everyone! We are all excited for the nearing RoW release and literally counting the days. We want to catch up with the Stormlight Archive so that all the details are fresh and clear.

I was chained down

I didn’t drown

I couldn’t seem to die

Protected everyone, as long as I could live

I fought my way out

I looked up and the men had their eyes on me

Total strangers

Moved to kindness by my story

Raised me back to health and joined me on a

Trip that was freedom bound...

&amp;#x200B;

I fought until i wasn’t whole

I fought my way into slavery

I was louder than the crack in my soul

I fought with many Shardbearers until they fell

I brought Bridge Four back from the dead and defended them well

And in the face of ignorance and negligence

I brought the Knights Radiant back into existence

And when my prayers to God were met with indifference

I picked up a spren, I spoke my own deliverance

&amp;#x200B;

In the wall of a Highstorm

There is quiet

For just a moment

It says here that Szeth was named Truthless in Shinovar after lying to the people there. As it is relating to Kaladin telling Szeth that he is a Windrunner, it is likely that Szeth told others in Shinovar about the return of the Knights Radiant and the people of Shinovar disregarded his claims and declared that he was Truthless (a liar).

1566,"Ok so I have these two theories and wanted to share and discuss them with you guys. First, it would be awesome if in the second half of the books the situation becomes so dire that a contingent of Elsecallers is sent out in an expedition to other Cosmere worlds seeking help. I imagine Sazed would send for volunteers and make their leader a Fullborn. Also a couple of Returned from Nalthis and volunteers with various heightenings. I would like to see some Elantrians as well, maybe the Scadrians can help them with Connection to the city. Others from Sel would be awesome as well, thinking of a Forger in action is delicious. Anyway, what do you guys think? 

The second one has to do with the missing shardblades. I think that various spren have collected their dead eyes to be near them in the Cognitive realm and have probably managed to collect and hide them in the physical realm as well. If not all of the spren have done this at the very least I would think that honourspren have. So I’m hoping for an underwater cave near Kharbranth full of shardblades.",Stormlight_Archive,Two little theories (or more like hopes) of mine

1572,"**Please no Oathbringer spoilers**

So, first off: I absolutely loved all Mistborn books (read the Wax &amp; Wayne series for the first time), as well as Way of Kings (I'd remembered the Shallan chapters as boring, but actually really enjoyed them). 

But Kaladin &amp; Dalinar are killing me in WoR so far, and I need to talk about it (pretty much halfway through). I still remember roughly what happens, but it's been quite a while since I've read the book, so most details I don't know anymore.  
I don't particularly enjoy the grumpiness and secrecy of Kaladin, or the rudeness of Adolin (I like when main characters get along and talk to each other), but that's not all that much of a problem.   
What I really can't understand in this book so far is Dalinar. Kaladin goes to him, tells him about Amaram (I faintly remember how this whole thing ends, so it's really just about the current situation). Now, I get that this is a man Dalinar's known for a while, and trusts. But still: The man Dalinar trusts with the safety of his whole family, the king and thus the kingdom, comes to him and tells him the truth about Amaram. He basically dismisses him, doesn't mention it anymore, leaves him to stew in it and names the man the head of his new order of Radiants. 

Am I missing something, so far? Does this make sense in anyway? I just find it to be a huge contradiction in Dalinar's character. Not that he doesn't immediately believe Kaladin, but that he puts so much trust in Amaram *and* Kaladin *both at the same time*. It just seems contrived for plot reasons, and not really believable.

1587,"&amp;#x200B;

A couple of things have stood out to me in the early release chapters as they relate to Kaladin - in particular:

* Kaladin's big sad is as bad (worse) than it has ever been before. In book 1 when he was at his most depressed, there was much more of a reason for him to be losing hope. Now, all things considered, things are going well. His family is alive, Dalinar is alive, he is building out the Windrunners, there have been no Bridge 4 deaths. Life is good, yet Kaladin is very sad
* They have made multiple references to it starting w/ Lopen's near death experience - something I think we'll learn more about in Dawnshard - on Aimia. The implication is that the almost-death of a bridge 4 member pushed him over the edge and he has been unable to pull himself back.

Alongside that, I was thinking about the unmade and what we know of them. A few notes on my understanding of the unmade (please correct me if I am wrong!)

* The unmade are spren - meaning they are the embodiment of some sort of emotion or element. Higher spren are more complicated and have more levels, but fundamentally they still tend to tie to some aspect of nature.
* Despite Oathbringer giving us much more information on the unmade - we still know very little about the vast majority of them. The ones we DO know about show us a much clearer connection to the element / emotion / aspect of nature they represent:

Ashertmarn - Heart of the Revel - represents Gluttony

Nergaoul - The Thrill - represents bloodlust / battle rage

Re-Shephir - The Midnight Mother - drawn to violence and pain

* Most of the other unmade are largely a mystery, though some we certainly know more or less about.

This all leads to my theory. **Kaladin's current depths of depression are being stoked by one of the unmade representing sadness / depression / nihilism.** As we saw with Dalinar and the thrill - the unmade don't create new emotions within people, but rather unleash what is already there. Kaladin's predisposition to depression and inability to live up to his own expectations are the perfect vessel for an unmade that is rooted in sadness.

Furthermore, ultimately I believe all of the unmade are going to be captured in perfect gemstones. As with Dalinar and Nergaoul, an unmade can only be imprisoned by someone who truly understands them. I think a key plot of ROW is going to be **Kaladin's struggle with depression that will allow him to imprison the sadness unmade when that time comes.**

If that theory is correct, which character's do you suppose will truly understand the rest of the unmade? Lift and gluttony (Ashertmarn)? Shalland and Re-Shepir?

Anyways - this is probably all wrong so thank you for reading my ramblings. Release day can't come soon enough!",Stormlight_Archive,[RoW] Kaladin and the Unmade
1589,"Is it possible that the dagger Monash uses to kill Jezrien is a tool used to make an unmade?

Could it be that the unmade were people/beings that were from Ashyr? Capture by Odium with a similar device as he chased the Heralds to Roshar, the souls of the newly unmade being trapped in gemstones. They would have to be someone who has carried or been infused with investiture so Odium would have enough time to take their soul before it passes into the beyond. Hence why Jezrien needed to be the one who died.

The Stormlight Archive is an amazing series and there are plenty of reasons why, but the most significant one for me is how relatable and authentic the characters are. Except all my own character development I have gone through with these books and characters, there is one particular thing I would love to focus on - the portrayal of art in Shallan's chapters. Honestly I think that every artist should read some of the quotes there. I just can't get over the portrait thing - reading all about it made me dying to go to the local café and just sketch people. Just to create Memories. And I actually very often catch myself, blinking faster and trying to remember for forever a wonderful view just to draw it later. Drawing became suddenly a way to save memories for later, to picture down as many interesting faces as I can in my sketchbook and to focus mainly on putting the piece of the soul of person I draw into portrait. Not just a passion. But like the most important skill I could have and it gave me a lot of confidence to create.

The Stormlight Archive had a great impact on my artistic skills development, because Shallan's passion to draw inspired me, when I have had my worse artblock since... I can't even remember. And from the time of Stormlight - it never happened again. I think that this topic  (portrayal of art in TSA) is quite unappreciated, while actually for me it was one of the main reasons why I totally fell in love with the series. So how did you like it?

So far, I've loved the book and I'm thrilled to be reading the series again. It's really satisfying how the story hits the ground running right from the start. The Way of Kings inherently had to be a bit slower paced as an intro work, which doesn't bother me, but it was satisfying to dive into the deep end right away.

# Jasnah

Her character has always been enjoyable for me as a means of exposition. Her dialogue helps make sense of concepts that confused me in the beginning, so seeing Gavilar's assassination from her perspective - and her early experience in Shadesmar - was a great opener and was a good reminder of how this all started. It also explained something from the Parshendi very clearly. When asked why they betrayed the Alethi, Gangnah says:

&gt;“Because your father was about to do something very dangerous.” (p. 28).

Still not sure what was dangerous about Gavilar's choices, but maybe it's related to the strange crystal sphere he gave to Szeth? Or the lack of a 10th statue of the Heralds?

I noticed two strange characters in this scene - a nervous Alethi guy talking about someone named ""Ash"" who isn't doing well, and an Azish man in black and silver with a white mark on his cheek. They seemed to be discussing a Shardblade that belonged to a king that was now in the possession of some ""creature,"" not sure if they mean Szeth but it was very suspicious. I reread that part in TWoK and noticed these two talking to Elhokar from Szeth's perspective. I wonder if this implies that it isn't merely the Parshendi who made the choice to kill Gavilar but some larger cabal of nations. Maybe these two are Ghostbloods?

It was surprising to see how much information Jasnah was dishing out to Shallan about Shadesmar and spren, to the extent that it started to transform my understanding of how these worlds and beings relate to the reality the humans live in. The concept that spren are living ideas reminds me of Neil Gaiman's American Gods, where people's belief in deities or ideas conveys real power to them.

Jasnah says this:

&gt;""We broke an oath, and in so doing offended \[the spren\] greatly. I think some of them may have died, though how a concept can die, I do not know.” (p. 42).

I was immediately reminded of this line from Jezrien in TWoK:

&gt;""A … a decision has been made. It is time for the Oathpact to end.” (p. 3).

I wonder whether it was the Heralds that broke this oath Jasnah is speaking of rather than the humans. It's interesting in later chapters how Pattern and Syl quiet down or hold back information when questions like this are asked of them. Their motivations are curious because they both have a kind of amnesia.

Jasnah says this about spren:

&gt;“I must admit, Shallan, I find the coincidence of our meeting to be startling. Suspiciously so.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Brightness?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“They were involved,” Jasnah said. “They brought you to me. And they are still watching you, it appears. So no, Shallan, you no longer have a choice. The old ways are returning, and I don’t see it as a hopeful sign. It’s an act of self-preservation. The spren sense impending danger, and so they return to us. (p. 43)

What danger they sense must be the True Desolation that Dalinar saw in TWoK. And then:

&gt;“When once humans and spren bonded, the results were women who danced in the skies and men who could destroy the stones with a touch.”(p. 46).

Spren seemingly rely on humans for their existence, so it's interesting that despite their betrayal they're somehow forced to protect them. It's a mutual relationship but not one they engage in unless necessary. I'm curious how spren confer these powers on to the people they bond with, and I'm curious why there are types of spren that are seemingly mindless. Are they like the Parshendi? Are they beings that have simply forgotten what they are and need to transform to regain their powers? Or are they just manifestations of forces of nature as Jasnah suggests?

I also recall in TWoK that in one of Dalinar's visions, there's a regal man who keeps talking about the ""Nahel bond."" I wonder what exactly that bond is and how it relates to the spren bond.

Jasnah says they need evidence to prove to the world that the end of civilization is nigh, and that for some reason she believes the ruins of Urithiru have a secret that would suffice as evidence. What that secret is, I'm not sure. Perhaps it's about the breaking of the Oathpact? Or something that explains the betrayal of the spren?

And lastly, Jasnah's death seemed... odd to me. I refuse to believe she actually died, or that if she did die, there's some way she'll return. To me, she's too important to the plot, too much of a developed character to just suddenly, unceremoniously die on a ship.

There's also this:

&gt;Heart thumping, Shallan felt her way to Jasnah’s cabin, **expecting at any moment to trip over the woman’s corpse on the floor. She didn’t.** Had the men dragged it above? (p. 118).

Maybe like the Heralds, she'll be reincarnated or somehow brought back to life. Maybe she's alive in a place similar to Shadesmar? Maybe she created some kind of deception with an illusory body to get the Ghostbloods off her trail? She had mentioned that she has her own bound spren called Ivory that gives her powers like the Knights Radiant. There's too many unanswered questions about her for her to be dead... right? (I hope so, I like her character).

# Shallan

I have *really* come to like Shallan in this book. She's had a good chance to blossom as a character and to put her tutelage to use. Where she felt like a child in the first book, she feels more adult now. She has more confidence, more swagger, more determination, and I enjoy seeing her utilize it. Getting the pieces of her traumatic childhood story has given me a lot more sympathy for her, too. She's damaged, but strong.

Her spren, Pattern, I love as well. His strange way of speaking and buzzing is somehow cute and ominous at once. His obsession with lies suits Shallan's story, as it's been almost nothing but deception from the beginning - lying to Jasnah about her motives, lying to herself about her past, deceiving people she meets. And yet Pattern is complex in that he enjoys ""true lies"" but also doesn't like to be called a liespren. The Cryptics are really odd, Jasnah's description is peculiar:

&gt;“Fine. You mentioned the Cryptics?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes,” Jasnah said, reaching into the sleeve that hid her safehand and slipping out a folded piece of paper—one of Shallan’s drawings of the symbolheads. “That is their own name for themselves, though we would probably name them liespren. They don’t like the term. Regardless, the Cryptics rule one of the greater cities in Shadesmar. Think of them as the lighteyes of the Cognitive Realm.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“So this thing,” Shallan said, nodding to the pattern, which was spinning in circles in the center of the cabin, “is like . . . a prince, on their side?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Something like that. There is a complex sort of conflict between them and the honorspren. Spren politics are not something I’ve been able to devote much time to. (p. 70).

Pattern is a real mystery to me. I noticed that [his kind are portrayed on the very first page of TWoK.](https://i.imgur.com/UV3lZfN.png) I wonder if that’s supposed to be Shallan’s drawing that appears in this scene. I suspect the Cryptics are central to this story in some way, given that they're like nobility and given that they are in conflict with honorspren like Syl. Does this mean that Shallan is being set up to eventually become an opponent to Kaladin? Or could it mean that Pattern is misleading Shallan for some nefarious purpose?

The scene where Jasnah dies was fucking awesome. Pattern turning the entire ship into water was crazy (what a great visual), and to see the way in which the representation of objects in Shadesmar sort of resist change was cool.

It's also convinced me that Shallan's drawings (""Memories"") aren't just drawings but some power she's using that involves Shadesmar. Jasnah tells her this:

&gt;“All around us you see the physical world. You can touch it, see it, hear it. This is how your physical body experiences the world. Well, Shadesmar is the way that your cognitive self—your unconscious self—experiences the world. Through your hidden senses touching that realm, you make intuitive leaps in logic and you form hopes. It is likely through those extra senses that you, Shallan, create art.” (pp. 40-41).

This section with Pattern was a bit unnerving, not sure what to make of it:

&gt;Pattern had started buzzing in the middle of the storm—a strange, angry sound. After that, he’d ranted in a language she didn’t understand, panicking Gaz and the other soldiers she’d invited into the shelter. (p. 308).

And what followed was a big revelation about spren and voidbringers:

&gt;“Voidbringers,” Shallan said, cold.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes. I do not think that my kind would live in a world with only them. They have their own spren.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Shallan sat up sharply. “Their own spren?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Pattern shrank on her table, scrunching up, his ridges growing less distinct as they mashed together.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well?” Shallan asked.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We do not speak of this.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“You might want to start,” Shallan said. “It’s important.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Pattern buzzed. She thought he was going to insist on the point, but after a moment, he continued in a very small voice. **“Spren are . . . power . . . shattered power. Power given thought by the perceptions of men. Honor, Cultivation, and . . . and another. Fragments broken off.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;“Another?” Shallan prodded.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pattern’s buzz became a whine, going so high pitched she almost couldn’t hear it. “Odium.” He spoke the word as if needing to force it out. (p. 309).

I wonder if those red lightning spren that Kaladin sees are Voidbringer spren, fragments of Odium itself. Yet other parts of the story make me think Voidbringers and spren are completely different.

Shallan's experience with the Santhid was interesting and I'm not sure what to make of it. How and why that creature saved her is curious.

When she washes up and finds the slaver Tvlakv, I felt like that name was familiar. I remembered it was the same slaver who had Kaladin in TWoK, making me worry for Shallan. Then once I saw the name Gaz it almost made my stomach drop. And yet, I feel some sympathy for him. He's a much different character in this storyline than he was when he was commanding Kaladin and Bridge Four around. His rant about how it was ultimately the lighteyes who fucked everyone over made me realize that he has more of a similar view to Kaladin than I think Kaladin would like to admit. They both feel victimized by superiors.

Shallan's behavior throughout this whole section was hilarious and awesome. The way she outsmarts dangerous men with her... mmmm... lies... buzz... (sorry) was very entertaining and made me feel kind of proud of her. She isn't some feckless child, she's frighteningly capable on her own. I loved her swindling Kaladin out of his boots. 

And all of that was encapsulated in this one moment when she uses stormlight to intimidate Tvlakv:

&gt;Standing before him, feeling radiant in the glow of the flames—towering above him and his grubby machinations—she saw. **Expectation wasn’t just about what people expected of you. It was about what you expected of yourself.** (p. 230).

Tyn was such a great character, I thoroughly enjoyed her. She had this swashbuckling attitude I liked, and the fact that she was another badass woman was really great to see. So I was incredibly shocked to realize she was a lighteyes assassin sent to kill Jasnah and Shallan by the Ghostbloods. That whole scene legitimately had my hands sweating and I practically cheered at the end when Shallan summoned her shardblade and killed Tyn. What a fucking awesome scene, some seriously great writing from Sanderson there. It did make me realize I need to be suspicious of everyone Shallan randomly meets. I’m also really curious why the Ghostbloods are interested in Urithiru... again, is it possible those two shifty guys at the beginning - the Alethi and the Azish man - are Ghostbloods themselves?

# Eshonai

This was my favorite section in the book thus far. I had correctly guessed in TWoK by the title of the chapter that this Parshendi Shardbearer was called Eshonai. What I hadn’t expected is that she’s female(n) (never assume a Voidbringer’s gender, check your privilege Alethi). The name Listeners is an apropos title in a couple ways - it speaks to the way they've silently embedded themselves in human society, hearing everything they do, as well as the way they hear songs collectively. It also contrasts them with the humans who are purely out for revenge and almost entirely refuse to listen to the Parshendi (save Adolin and Dalinar).

Getting a perspective from the Parshendi was *extremely* transformative to my view of the plot. I pity them, I empathize with their broken, desperate people, now realizing they need gemhearts simply to eat, that some of them willingly transformed into mindless slaves. And now, the brutal descriptions of their killings on the Shattered Plains are disturbing to me.

I loved the way Sanderson contrasted the humanizing of the Parshendi with later chapters that show Sadeas and Adolin enjoying massacring them, it made the whole conflict a lot more gray to me. It paints the humans as monstrous aggressors who are too violent to be reasoned with, like Voidbringers of a different kind.

The idea that they attune to these shared songs on the ParshendiNet (sorry) is fascinating, and it’s a novel concept by Sanderson how they use a song-like rhythm to convey the tone and emotion of their speech. But moreover, the idea that these beings can transform in highstorms and that they’re working to unlock more forms is awesome... and horrifying.

And then there’s passages like this:

&gt;“Daring was the challenge made,” Mother sang, “when the Last Legion abandoned thought and power in exchange for freedom. They risked forgetting all. And so songs they composed, a hundred stories to tell, to remember. I tell them to you, and you will tell them to your children, until the forms are again discovered.”  
&gt;  
&gt;From there, Mother launched into one of the early songs, about how the people would make their home in the ruins of an abandoned kingdom. How they would spread out, act as simple tribes and refugees. It was their plan to remain hidden, or at least ignored.  
&gt;  
&gt;The songs left out so much. The Last Legion hadn’t known how to transform into anything other than dullform and mateform, at least not without the help of the gods. How had they known the other forms were possible? Had these facts originally been recorded in the songs, and then lost over the years as words changed here and there? (p. 202).

Interesting that the Parshendi have an unreliable history of their people, much like the way that Vorinism seems to have sanitized, altered, or forgotten certain facts about the Knights Radiant and the Heralds. Both factions are struggling against one another with an incomplete understanding of the past, and I suspect it makes them doomed to repeat it.

They talk of these dark gods who ruled over them that they call the Unmade. Not sure exactly what they're referring to, but a lot of the poems at the beginning of chapters have interesting insights:

&gt;The betrayal of spren has brought us here.  
They gave their Surges to human heirs,  
But not to those who know them most dear, before us.  
’Tis no surprise we turned away  
Unto the gods we spent our days  
And to become their molding clay, they changed us.  
&gt;  
&gt;—From the Listener Song of Secrets, 40th stanza (p. 338).

I remember Jasnah talking about there being a betrayal of the spren, but in this case it sounds like the Parshendi betrayed them and they gave their powers to humans instead. So these dark gods came in to fill the voids that spren left behind perhaps?

&gt;’Tis said it was warm in the land far away  
When Voidbringers entered our songs.  
We brought them home to stay  
And then those homes became their own,  
It happened gradually.  
And years ahead ’twil still be said ’tis how it has to be.  
&gt;  
&gt;—From the Listener Song of Histories, 12th stanza (p. 355).

This part is particularly curious - it seems to describe Voidbringers as something *other* than the Parshendi, some kind of beings they invited into their culture. Are these the Unmade? The gods they're so afraid of? It makes me more convinced that all sides in this conflict are pawns to greater forces, all of them are being deceived and drawn into a fight that is more of a concern to others. It makes the entire story tragic.

&gt;The spren betrayed us, it’s often felt.  
Our minds are too close to their realm  
That gives us our forms, but more is then  
Demanded by the smartest spren,  
We can’t provide what the humans lend,  
Though broth are we, their meat is men.  
&gt;  
&gt;—From the Listener Song of Spren, 9th stanza (p. 368).

Here it seems to suggest that spren *feed* on men and for some reason cannot do so off the Parshendi. Does it mean that the amnesiac spren like Syl and Pattern are malevolent beings? That their true purpose is not to help people but to exploit them? Or does it just mean that spren rely on humans to survive?

Lastly, another concerning passage:

&gt;“You yourself brought us the report, Eshonai,” Abronai continued. “You saw a warrior among the Alethi using ancient powers, and many others confirmed it to us. Surgebindings have returned to men. The spren again betray us.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“If Surgebindings are back,” Davim said to Consideration, “then it might indicate that the gods are returning anyway. If so, we’d best be prepared to deal with them. Forms of power will help with that.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“We don’t know they will come,” Eshonai said to Resolve. “We don’t know any of this. Who knows if men even have Surgebindings—it might be one of the Honorblades. We left one in Alethkar that night.”(p. 204).

So, I suspect that the spren are somehow opposed to the Voidbringers and have sent beings like Syl and Pattern down to humans for that reason. But why? It's also strange that the Parshendi sound like they plan to resist the Voidbringers this time, yet Eshonai seems convinced that Stormform will do the opposite - it will invite the gods back and threatens their people.

And lastly, I'm curious about Honorblades. I know Syl is an Honorspren, so could they be talking about Kaladin? I'm not sure how this concept relates to and differs from Radiants.

# Kaladin

*Cue ""*[The Boys are Back in Town](https://youtu.be/hQo1HIcSVtg?t=48) *by Thin Lizzy.""* 

I was so happy to see Kaladin again, I loved the gradual rise of Bridge Four into something to be proud of, something honorable. To see his friends and compatriots lifted out of their misery was incredibly satisfying, and to now see them in the service of the Kholins makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. 

The scene where Kaladin's tattoo of freedom can't overwrite his branding of 'dangerous' was symbolically powerful. The irony of his Surgebinder powers is the way that they force him to be a part of something much bigger than himself, whether he likes it or not. It's as though he's a slave to his destiny now.

The red lightning spren are strange, as I said before I wonder if they're fragments of Odium or are somehow related to the Voidbringers. It's clearly linked to this passage:

&gt;Stormform is said to cause   
A tempest of winds and showers,   
Beware its powers, beware its powers.   
Though its coming brings the gods their night,   
It obliges a bloodred spren.   
Beware its end, beware its end. (p. 286). 

Syl has been entertaining with her jokes and sarcasm, it's nice to see her develop into something more complex in the same way as Pattern. 

This passage was odd:

&gt;“Where were you before?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Another place. With lots of spren. I can’t remember well . . . it had lights in the air. Living lights.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Like lifespren.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes. And no. Coming here risked death. Without you, without a mind born of this realm, I couldn’t think. Alone, I was just another windspren.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“But you’re not windspren,” Kaladin said, kneeling beside a large pool of water. “You’re honorspren.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes,” Syl said. (p. 132).

It almost sounds like Syl is implying that *all spren* can become like herself or Pattern provided that they're bound to a person. It makes me more wary of regular spren, like they're more than they seem to be. Almost like they have the same potential to transform as common Parshmen. 

I also don't know what to make about her ""living lights"" comment, but this later passage references something similar:

&gt;Light flashed out there, glistening through the drops of water. Another flash. Then the light stayed. Steady, like glowing spheres, just outside. Faintly red. For some reason he couldn’t explain, Kaladin had the impression of eyes. (p. 286). 

Is this to say that spren exist in some place with Odium? Have they been imprisoned there? Syl had said she had to disobey the Stormfather in this next passage, and it seems the Stormfather and Odium oppose each other, so that doesn't add up:

&gt;Syl landed on the side of the pool, looking like a woman standing on an ocean’s shore. Kaladin frowned, leaning down to inspect her more closely. She seemed . . . different. **Had her face changed shape?**   
&gt;  
&gt;“There are others like you,” Syl whispered. “I do not know them, but I know that other spren are trying, in their own way, to reclaim what was lost.”   
&gt;  
&gt;She looked to him, and **her face now had its familiar form. The fleeting change had been so subtle, Kaladin wasn’t sure if he’d imagined it.**   
&gt;  
&gt;“I am the only honorspren who has come,” Syl said. “I . . .” She seemed to be stretching to remember. “I was forbidden. I came anyway. To find you.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“You knew me?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“No. But I knew I’d find you.” She smiled. “I spent the time with my cousins, searching.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“The windspren.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Without the bond, I am basically one of them,” she said. “Though they don’t have the capacity to do what we do. And what we do is important. So important that I left everything, defying the Stormfather, to come. You saw him. In the storm.”   
&gt;  
&gt;The hair stood up on Kaladin’s arms. He had indeed seen a being in the storm. A face as vast as the sky itself. Whatever the thing was—spren, Herald, or god—it had not tempered its storms for Kaladin during that day he’d spent strung up.   
&gt;  
&gt;“We are needed, Kaladin,” Syl said softly. She waved for him, and he lowered his hand to the shore of the tiny violet ocean glowing softly in the chasm. She stepped onto his hand, and he stood up, lifting her. **She walked up his fingers and he could actually feel a little weight, which was unusual.** (p. 133).

What a wild exchange this part is. Her face changing and her gaining real world weight is really, really peculiar. Is Syl at some point going to become fully corporeal and enter the world as a physical being? Is her identity in question or something? The face transformation is too weird.

But she says she had to defy the Stormfather to come to Roshar. So the Stormfather forbids spren from bonding with people... are highstorms a kind of punishment he's doling out to mankind for their treachery? Did the Stormfather intend to sit back and let mankind be annihilated by Odium or something? Why would the spren have a different opinion than him? It's all so confusing! Yeah, yeah, RAFO, I know. 

I wonder whether this part foreshadows Kaladin eventually inheriting Gavilar's Shardblade:

&gt;“The king has hinted that someday, he might bestow his father’s Blade upon a worthy warrior.” (p. 236). 

It would denote Kaladin as worthy, it would reverse his feeling that the lighteyes only *take* things from him, and it would right the wrong that was Amaram's treachery. Shardblade Kaladin would tear shit up, so I hope this is true. Plus, Gavilar's Shardblade is described as a super badass look.

&gt;“And where did they come from in the first place?” Kaladin asked. “Shardblades. Shardplate. Even modern fabrials are nowhere near as good. So where did the ancients get weapons so amazing?”   
&gt;  
&gt;Syl fell silent. She had a frustrating habit of doing that when his questions got too specific.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Well?” he prompted.   
&gt;  
&gt;“I wish I could tell you.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Then do.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“I wish it worked that way. It doesn’t.” (pp. 241-242).

That answer is highly suspicious. I remember Adolin speaking to his Shardblade before a duel and suggesting that it was somehow alive. I wonder if that's a fact, like Shardblades are beings themselves in some form.

&gt;He could see the man’s eyes now—they were brown—but Kaladin had trouble placing his age. Those eyes seemed old somehow, but the man’s skin didn’t seem wrinkled enough to match them. He could have been thirty-five. Or he could have been seventy. Too young, Kaladin thought, though he couldn’t say why. (p. 242). 

This description of Zahel is noteworthy, I suspect he's much more than he pretends to be. I really like his character, it was nice to see someone other than a Kholin who believes in nerd-ass Renarin as a warrior.

&gt;“Am I really Bridge Four?” Shen asked.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Of course you are.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Where is my spear?”   
&gt;  
&gt;Kaladin looked Shen in the eyes. “What do you think?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“I think that I am not Bridge Four,” Shen said, taking time to think with each word. “I am Bridge Four’s slave.”   
&gt;  
&gt;It was like a punch to Kaladin’s gut. He’d hardly heard a dozen words out of the man during their time together, and now this? The words smarted either way. Here was a man who, unlike the others, wasn’t welcome to leave and make his way in the world. Dalinar had freed the rest of Bridge Four—but a parshman . . . he’d be a slave no matter where he went or what he did. (p. 296). 

This was fucking sad. I feel horrible for Shen knowing what his experience is like from Eshonai's chapter. It's a huge injustice that they've done to him by treating him this way. It's probably the only thing I've seen Kaladin do that I outright hated. I get it, but I don't like it.

&gt;SON OF HONOR, said a voice like roaring wind.   
&gt;  
&gt;“This is real!” Kaladin yelled into the storm. He was wind itself. Spren. He found voice somehow. “You are real!”   
&gt;  
&gt;SHE TRUSTS YOU.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Syl?” Kaladin called. “Yes, she does.”   
&gt;  
&gt;SHE SHOULD NOT.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Are you the one who forbade her to come to me? Are you the one who keeps the spren back?”   
&gt;  
&gt;YOU WILL KILL HER. The voice, so deep, so powerful, sounded regretful. Mournful. YOU WILL MURDER MY CHILD AND LEAVE HER CORPSE TO WICKED MEN.   
&gt;  
&gt;“I will not!” Kaladin shouted.   
&gt;  
&gt;YOU BEGIN IT ALREADY.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;“How can I prevent it?” Kaladin demanded. “How can I protect her?”   
&gt;  
&gt;YOU ARE HUMAN. YOU WILL BE A TRAITOR.   
&gt;  
&gt;“No I won’t!”   
&gt;  
&gt;YOU WILL CHANGE. MEN CHANGE. ALL MEN.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;AH, the Stormfather said. SO IT WILL END.   
&gt;  
&gt;“What?” Kaladin shouted into the winds. “What changed? I feel—”   
&gt;  
&gt;HE COMES FOR YOU, LITTLE TRAITOR. I AM SORRY.   
&gt;  
&gt;Something rose before Kaladin. A second storm, one of red lightning, so enormous as to make the continent—the world itself—into nothing by comparison. Everything fell into its shadow.   
&gt;  
&gt;I AM SORRY, the Stormfather said. HE COMES. (pp. 368-369).

What an awesome scene, I love these sequences with Kaladin riding storms. It's so odd to have these conflicting pieces of information about spren and men - we're told that spren rely on people to exist in some way, so without them they'd cease to be. And yet the Stormfather says that all men are treacherous and will kill spren. I can't imagine why Kaladin would ever turn on Syl, especially since he attracted her as an Honorspren (doesn't that mean he's honorable?), but then again, her memory is shot so there could be some yet unknown aspect of her that might justify Kaladin turning on her. Is the Stormfather just butthurt about the Heralds breaking the Oathpact and so he thinks all humans are garbage?

Szeth's attack on the Shattered Plains was another stellar scene from Sanderson. The whole thing literally had my hands sweating. To see a confrontation between Kaladin and Szeth was phenomenal.

&gt;“I can’t beat him,” Kaladin whispered, tears in his eyes. Tears of pain. Tears of frustration. “He’s one of us. A Radiant.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“No!” Syl said forcefully. “No. He’s something far more terrible. No spren guides him, Kaladin. Please. Get up.” (p. 376).

Excuse me, *what?* How the hell can a person be a Surgebinder with no spren? I thought those powers were derived from that bond. Is he a servant of Odium or something? Is he granted his powers through some unnatural way?

&gt;“What are you?” he demanded.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Same thing you are,” Kaladin said. He felt a wave of nausea, but forced himself to appear firm. “Windrunner.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“You can’t be.”   
&gt;  
&gt;Kaladin held up the knife, the few wisps of remaining Light steaming from his skin. Rain sprinkled him.   
&gt;  
&gt;The assassin scrambled backward, eyes as wide as if Kaladin had turned into a chasmfiend. “They told me I was a liar!” the assassin screamed. “They told me I was wrong! Szeth-son-son-Vallano . . . Truthless. They named me Truthless!” (pp. 378-379). 

I love Kaladin forcing himself to be badass in this scene. He's confused and scared but has to put out the image that he knows what he's doing. I'm glad to finally get some insight into this ""Truthless"" moniker. So I assume it means that Szeth somehow foretold the return of the Radiants and blasphemed in doing so, getting him banished or punished? I know it's been said that foretelling the future is something associated with Voidbringers, but I still don't quite get why this would exact a punishment on him.

The contrast of these two statements between the books was interesting:

&gt;What is he?”   
&gt;  
&gt;“Death,” Kaladin whispered.   
&gt;  
&gt;Words of Radiance (p. 381). 

Versus:

&gt;“What am I?” Szeth whispered, a bit of Light leaking from his lips as he looked past the man down the long hallway. “I’m … sorry.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Way of Kings (p. 11). 

I pity Szeth, it sucks that he's seen as this evil person when he appears to be more of a captive, forced to commit horrible acts against his will.

And then there's this:

&gt;“But his Shardblade . . .”   
&gt;  
&gt;“What of it?” Kaladin asked.   
&gt;  
&gt;“It was different. Very different.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“It looked ordinary to me. Well, as ordinary as a Shardblade can.”   
&gt;  
&gt;“It was different,” she repeated. “I feel I should know why. Something about the amount of Light he was consuming . . .” (p. 383). 

*What?!* So Szeth has no spren bound to him but also has an unusual Shardblade? What the hell is going on here? 

I recalled this part of TWoK:

&gt;If their masters had died, the Blades would have vanished. These Blades were weapons of power beyond even Shardblades. These were unique. Precious.  
&gt;  
&gt; The Way of Kings (p. 2). 

This is the only passage I'm aware of that describes unusual blades. Is it conceivable that Szeth somehow has a blade that belonged to the Heralds? Or does it just mean that he has a Shardblade that was created in a way differing from the others? It makes his character so much more interesting, it's the only time I've seen Syl react to a Shardblade this way. I can't wait to read more about him, especially now that he knows there are others like him.

Metareadings saying Kaladin will die and others saying Nohadon is near Dalinar.

Please, add your own 'little thoughts' and 'crack pot theories' to this, it would be fun to present a Diagram for RoW.

  Note, Zahel isn't predicted by Taravangian. I believe Zahel might act and, if he doesn't, it will be crimson(rs).

The Diagram

\[ Text elaborated before being recruited by Odium \]

Texts and practical experiences say the Radiants aren’t merely surgebinders. Beware the Skybreakers, though they may align with you, they’re not to be trusted.

Dalinar needs my legitimacy so Jah Keved and my surgeons may follow his lead. He and his Assassin cannot touch me for now, though they’ll undermine my actions. Can the Diagram, my predictions, do anything? Protect me? Destroy them? 

The Herald Ash can’t be trusted. Will they all act? Will she… Join Dalinar?

The Diagram must now look for wild cards. Only a well played game may… Justify… My actions. Or not? Beware newbies. Can Odium have more sympathizers in undercover? Beware all.

Six groups were predicted by me in the Jah Keved civil war… Though the seventh one is a stray and not a significant one at that, Redin, the King’s Bastard, has all the nuances to become a Radiant. Beware the wild cards. Don’t let your grip weaken. 

Mraize has been briefly spotted in Urithiru. Unpredictable. He seeks ancient knowledge. Not fabrials. The Tranquiline Halls? He possibly has his grips in someone important. More investigations are necessary. Will Malata will be enough? Does they intent on Ascending?

Emul may yet turn their cloaks. Beware them, Odium may influence their actions and wills.

Gavilar’s visions reached more men. Moelach’s touch is a must so the Diagram can succeed. Is there a surge that can reach the Overworld(Spiritual World) more easily? Beware any oddity. Anything efficiently blocking your plans of Odium’s plan asks for weariness. 

\[ Zahel and Endowment’s visions. Will he act? Can he? \]

Now I have concluded my negotiations with Odium… What is there for me to do? Serve him? Undermine his plans? Can Odium somehow fully control me? He must know the Diagram can’t serve him as means to precaution… Will this be enough? Can Dalinar… ?

The bridgemen are sensible. Can they fight themselves? The Skybreakers, perhaps? Can we break their vows? Their captain certainly is willing to sacrifice himself for others. Remember it.

Highprince Adolin is predictable. Follow his actions.

The Lightweaver said something of the Taker of Secrets saving them… Can it be possible? Can the Unmade really betray their creator? What would be her objective?

1727,"Adjective therapy is defined as the use of art and creativity as a way to cope with trauma and psychological disorder. 

With Shallan we are introduced to what seems like a fairly well off individual who more or less has her head on straight, is an exceptional artist and budding scholar essentially pushing a PhD with one of the foremost scholars of her time. 

Her motivations are jubilees in that she has intentions to steal the soul aster but otherwise has managed to secure this position through her own merits (privilege aside).

Throughout the story we see Shallan grow and practice her art as a scholar fantastically, using her art and talents to make uncover some major revelations and secrets of the radiant.

However, somewhere along the line she starts to really slide into what I can only call an unhealthy state of mind. 

Before this Shallan was actively drawing, learning, and becoming a better version of herself. Through her art Shallan is somehow able to inspire others to do the same. 

But then there is a break in this pattern. At some point her art takes the back burner and as of RoW, at least so far, her art is nowhere to be found and Shallan is, at least imo, in a worse mental state than we left her at the devastating end of OB.

As a psychologist I know Adjunctive therapy can be very successful without any magical or fantastical boost, so for Shallan I believe this is what was really helping her keep things anchored and in control. 

My theory is that Shallan will “speak” her next truth and ideal through her art and that it will be a complete picture of herself, including every part, including even the parts that she wants to forget. It will be her greatest piece of art and like her herald something that will be respected on the level of the Mona Lisa in our world.

1728,"TL;DR - Soulcasters are made from Shardblades. 

Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we have evidence of new soulcasters being made by Rosharans, except that the Aimians were known to have been skilled artifabrians who made the soulcasters. We also know that none of Dalinar's visions show ancient soulcasters, Navani makes the point that current fabrial technology seems much more advanced than the ancients had, except for the healy-thingy, soulcasters, and shards. 

Where are all the shardblades? Dalinar has also noted that there seems to be far fewer shardblades than what his visions would indicate. Until RoW, we have mostly speculated that they're being kept in hidden caches, likely by the Shin and secret organizations. 

Now, here's the relevant passage in RoW Chapter 9:

&gt;[Spoilers]&gt;!Soulcasters manifested as small unresponsive spren, hovering with their eyes closed. So the Soulcasters did have a captured spren. A Radiant spren, judging by their shape. Intelligent, rather than the more animal-like spren captured to power normal fabrials.!&lt;

Where do the artifabrians get these spren for the soulcasters? Do they work to find an intelligent spren then make it a deadeyes and THEN craft the soulcaster? No, that's too complicated.

1744,"Hi, so it's as the title says. A while ago I've finished part 2 of Oathbringer and I'm at page 578. I haven't found the will to pick it up again. 
Let me preface this by saying that I absolutely loved The Way of Kings and Word of Radiance. They're both part of my favourite books I've read. I'm struggling with Oathbringer however. 

While it definitely has its moments so far (in particular the bit where Kaladin goes home and the part where they fight the unmade Re-Shephir), the book has become a bit of a drag for me. I find myself not all that interested in the politics and the convincing of world leaders by showing them the contents of Dalinar's dreams, the multiple personalities of Shallan or the training with Kaladin. Where in the first two books you had a feeling of it going somewhere I'm not yet sure where all this leads to. In the first two books the build-up was brilliant and the pay off was amazing. 

The main thing that is bothering me is that I've lost all sympathy for one of my favourite characters, Dalinar. Seeing how he used to be in the past I find it very hard to root for him now. Where once I've looked up to him the most, now I find myself with disgust as I read one horrible thing after another he's done in the past. Not caring about much else than the Thrill (which by the way I'm kind of tired of reading about). I have found it become a bit repetitive (especially characters thoughts or their struggles). I know there's the argument that it makes Dalinar more dimensional, but losing sympathy for a main character is one of my greatest fears with a book. I don't care as much anymore and I'm not as invested as I was before. Not to mention that everyone around him seems fine with his actions as well, causing me to lose sympathy for even more characters. Are Evi or Navani fine with him beating someone in a brawl to the point of brain damage and causing another to lose an arm? Do they think it's okay to stab someone through the back while he's begging for his life? Or the thousands he's killed mercilessly, including a father before his child? If not then why do they still love him dearly? 

Another thing is that it has possibly become a bit too high fantasy for me. Don't get me wrong, I like the world with its rockbuds, crem, chulls, chasmfiends, spren etc. It still felt very grounded to me. However with the windrunners flying around and the Heralds being tortured for eternity it somewhat lost that sense of realism. Or at least the possibility of it being a realistic fantasy world in my eyes. 

Would I do myself a disservice by not continuing with the series? Does it take a turn for ""the better""? I very much enjoy Sanderson's writing, so I don't want to give up too easily. It would be a shame because I'd miss out on the upcoming books in the series. Is the rest of the book worth it despite my complaints so far?

1756,"Not to stoke discord between the two fandoms, as I did enjoy GoT tv show and the first half of the ASOIAF book, but there are some very distinct differences that make tSA a better series so far.

Here are those reasons:

1. It’s very clear that Brandon Sanderson is dedicated to finishing the series in a timely manner. He’s known for being incredibly prolific. He’s churned out tons of series and novels that are highly praised. Mistborn being one of them. ASOIF is STILL waiting for the last book. 

2. His books aren’t just about war, but about the people in them. For example, Kaladin is less than a foot soldier for 99% of the first book. Sanderson gives readers an on-the-ground POV of what war is like. GRRM only talks about casualties and what the war leaders are thinking. 

3. This is the most important one for me. I’m about halfway through Words of Radiance and there’s not one reference of rape and pillaging. There’s one scene where a prostitute is attacked by a soldier but then is saved by Adolin. It’s clear that Sanderson has eschewed the whole “women are raped in times of war that’s how war is” line of thinking in fantasy/war novels and it’s refreshing to read a story in which the women are respected and revered. The whole “well that’s what happens in war” argument is null to me when it comes to fantasy novels because fantasy is just that — fantasy. Which means rape doesn’t need to be a concept. GRRM uses it as a plot device for characters.

4. There’s diversity. It’s not just a bunch of white-passing humans running around making up the population of the fantasy world. There are clear and distinct races, tons of ideologies and societal structures that make up the world that aren’t relegated to dwarves/elves/humans/etc in Sanderson’s tSA.

1767,"So I finished reading TWOK Prime today and it made me realize something. The series as it is stands is not living up to was promised in the first book(s\*). I wanted to not just share some thoughts, but observations on the series as a whole.

**What makes Prime good?**

Prime was a lot better then I was expecting. For a unpublished book from a author early in his career, the book still told a compelling plot while teasing mysteries and building a interesting world. It wasn't perfect, the ending felt rushed and anti-climatic, and some dialog felt really amateurish being my biggest complaints. Yet it also had a real grit and darkness I didn't think Sanderson was capable of. Ahrven was just a little over the top with his cruelty, but I still liked his results first morality. Elhokar killing Aredor, Renarin getting his mind destroyed, Taln dying at the end. The book had a suitable realness to it, as much as a fantasy can. In fact, about half way through I really wasn't sure who I was supposed to be rooting for. This is a great achievement to me. I don't want to come across as a edgelord here, I don't need gore, violence and perpetual dismay to enjoy a story. But moral greyness, characters facing consequences for their actions, these things give a world a very lived in realness. It means when a character does having an amazing (and maybe overpowered) moment, it hits so much harder. 

**So how does this relate to canon Stormlight?** 

My biggest complement for canon TWOK is similar to what I just described above. It feels dark, brutal at times, while making you feel like the world is a real place. Honestly Prime is probably darker, but TWOK has it's moments. Kaladin's journey from being a disposable body to his power awakening at the end is one of the most powerful stories I've ever read. It's powerful because of how the world is built. Characters are killed all the time around him, those in power have it and exercise it freely. He's treated brutally in a world that doesn't care, or those that do are unable to change anything. Much like the real world, but because it's fantasy we get to see him overcome it with awesome results. The main point I'm getting at here is both Prime and Canon TWOK introduce you into a brutal, yet realistic fantasy world. Much like real life, Roshar is filled with people who will do anything it takes to gain power. Bad things happen without immediate reckonings. And it makes the moments when something good happens so much more powerful. 

**Ok I've talked about the good, but why am I writing this post?**

I feel like over the next few books the world has been losing this intensity, it's edge. It's lost what both TWOK's brought and what hooked me on the series. Oathbringer started bringing the story into bland power fantasy territory, and everything I've read of ROW confirms that. Reading a character now I know everything is going to work out just fine for them. The stakes have been lost. Adolin faced no consequences for killing Sadeas. Kaladin will be overpowered until Sanderson feels we need a obstacle or wants to talk mental health. Szeth will be put in jail instead of immediately executed (seriously, how many people has killed, not to mention the Alethi king). I could go on but hopefully the point is coming across. Even with a world ending invasion, existence is literally being threatened, the tone has turned into Avengers: Roshar! Instead of getting darker as the stakes get higher, the story has gotten lighter. I would argue we're entering comic book territory. And this is not necessarily a bad thing, people like these kind of stories. But it's also not what was promised, what was set up in the first book (canon and prime). 

**TL;DR**

I'm glossing over a lot of points that also contribute to this story being great, namely the sense of mystery invoked from the beginning and awesome worldbuilding. And I still do love this series, I will be buying and reading ROW on release. But after reading TWOK Prime I can't help but be disappointed. It reminded me of why I was hooked by this series. Stormlight was never trying to be GRRM, Abercrombie (First Law), or Erikson (Malazan). But it wasn't Marvel either. It struck a very in the middle approach of having darkness and brutality, while also being a power fantasy.

1785,"  

With the come out of chapter 13 from Rhythm of War, more questions than answers have come to our minds. Especially around Mraize. Here I’ll write my observations and theories about this chapter: 

Multiple Investiture used by Mraize: 

Mraize emphasizes on how to transport Investiture from all along the Cosmere, and also that he always detects Veil, no matter how silent she could be. I think that the Investitures of whom Mraize has control over them are the following ones:

Warbreaker spoilers: &gt;!The first Investiture that Mraize could have is the Fourth Heightening from Nalthis. Just read those paragraphs: !&lt;

&gt;!“Mraize was a dark pillar on the far side, surveying the frosted mountain peaks. Veil didn’t try to sneak up on him; she knew he’d sense her coming. He seemed to be able to do that no matter how little sound she made. It was a trick she’d been trying to replicate.”!&lt;

&gt;!“She finally picked out what Mraize was watching: a small dot of color soaring through one of the canyons. His pet chicken, the green one. Mraize whistled sharply, and the sound echoed below. The creature turned in their direction.”!&lt;

&gt;!Yes, could it be that Mraize is a tineye. But knowing that Sazed modified the way to becoming an Allomancer, and the emphasis that Mraize puts into talking about the transport, I think that the most probably is that he possesses a Heightening. Since from now, the only way to transport Breaths, is by human exchange. Yes, you can store Breaths in an object, but then, only the person who put them in there is the only one who can pick them, because of Identity.!&lt;

&gt;!On the other hand, Veil distinguish the parrot by the color. But it also could be that Mraize possesses a tinmind without Identity. Because metalminds are literally Investiture containers. And so Iyatil was in Scadrial at the same timeline. Furthermore, even that she was born in the Cognitive Realm, she seems to follow the culture of the Southern Scadrians, who are the society with more knowledge about the metalminds without Identity.!&lt;

Those were the only Investiture systems that I detected on Mraize. But what about his parrot?

Sixth of the Dusk spoilers: &gt;!“So odd, how Mraize flaunted it. But she supposed that was part of who he was—he was never content blending in. Most would probably consider keeping strange exotic animals a quirk. Shallan couldn’t help but see more to it. Mraize collected trophies—she’d seen many odd things in his possession.”!&lt;

&gt;!I suspect that it could be an Aviar with new abilities. Remember that Sak was a bird from out the Pantheon, but thanks to Dusk, she could eat a parasite from Patji, and then get her powers. The conversation about transporting Investiture is the key about this. Since the parasites are the ones who give the Investiture to the Aviars when those eat them. I have two possible options for this case:!&lt;

&gt;!The first one is that the Ghosbloods have been transported the parasites to Roshar, along with the fruit that grows on Patji’s Fingers.!&lt;

&gt;!The second one, is that they only have been transported the fruit, and then tried to recreate the same effect but with cremlings, or another native especies.!&lt;

&gt;!This is the Investiture that more doubts bring to me, because the Cosmere timeline. Since Sixth of the Dusk takes place many years in the future from the Stormlight Archive, and Mistborn Era 2 timeline. Anyways, I like the possibility of this theory.!&lt;

Spy among the hosts of Shallan: 

My theory about Mraize’s spy, is that I doubt about one of the Davar siblings. Because the first thing that Shallan said about them, is that she’s being distancing from them, and has to encourage herself on visiting them frequently. I have no clue of who the spy could be, and it’s something that stuck into my mind. I suspect about Pattern, because he’s the most near to Shallan. And Mraize talks that he has interest in the Lightweavers, and the better one to talk about theme, is the spren of the order. We must remember that Pattern travelled to the Physical Realm to learn, and I think that the most helpful on this are the Ghostbloods.

Restares: 

I don’t know what could happen with this character. But what seems to be clear, is that we’ll know about him in the fifth part of the book. Since we know, he is in Shadesmar, and the covers of the books always shows a scene from the climax. What I suspect, is that Lasting Integrity is the giant monolith that appears in the cover.

The thoughts that I had from this chapter revive a weird theory about Adolin, that became popular when the cover was revealed. There were a lot of people saying that the sword he was holding had a biocromathic aura. What could make sense now. Because Lasting Integrity was where Azure was heading the last time we saw her in Oathbringer. Furthermore, she bought the travel, by giving knowledge about her sword to the honorspren. Perhaps Adolin don’t get her sword, but is likely probable that we’ll see Azure again on this book.

But it would have been far too convenient for that to have just been come up with by the last desolation where taln was the only one who had fallen. The heralds had all been exhausted for decades, maybe centuries, at this point so why wait until just then to think of it? Brandon is a better writer than that.

I'm usually the guy every body passes however this time some how I started to feel the need to go faster and faster and faster and I felt so alive and weird enough invencible. Was doing triple digits in a zone where anything over 60mph was unnecessary dangerous then I saw this big curve one that I know very well and I knew I had to go faster. I remember thinking ""witness me!!"" I do it or go in a blaze of glory. I had no fear just this crazy desire of go faster and take that curve as fast as I could. Then suddenly realized what was happening and started breaking as much as I was able, thankfully 15 years of experience some times kick in some muscle memory. Was able to break a little bit and just enough to take the curve fast enough to be scraping my footpegs and my make my rear try go loose grip a few times. Never took another curve that fast not even in a track bike in the track. I had to go from lane to lane and even then I almost hit the barrier. I remember having this shaky feeling and a bit of nausea, thankfully didn't puke. But that probably my biggest thrill moment in a mostly boring life.

1809,"Sooo I just finished this chapter where she salvaged a hopeless situation between the two caravans and I think it was great. What I'm actually really angry about and disliked about this is how the end of this turns out. 

So she persuaded Tvlakv to take her to the shattered plains with promised riches which was essentially the opposite direction of where he was heading. He agrees but is reluctant and does for the most part what she asks. Mind you if he refused she most likely would of died in the cold of the night, so basically he saved her life for repayment. 

After this whole incident she believes and demands he's indebted to her for saving his life and is stealing his slaves (cargo) as repayment even though she is the only reason they were there, in danger, and one of them died,  because she made them changed routes and went to the shattered plains. She also never pays him the promised riches. 


So am I missing something or does this just seem way out of left field and unwarranted. Not only does she not pay him, she steals his livelyhood and gets one of his caravan men killed.

1815,"There won't be a tonne of spoilers in this post, but the passage that triggered it is from Oathbringer, when Dalinar is observing someone getting used to having a safehand.

He describes her sitting by supporting herself with her right hand, and tucking her safehand along her waist.

When I imagined that posture, it reminded me of a person who has broken their wrist - an injury that wouldn't spawn a whole facet of culture. However, a much more permanent injury would be if someone's arm was struck by a shardblade. If the injury was low enough, they would lose use of their hand only, leaving them to use it much like a safehand as a blunt instrument.

Theories I can come up with: one of the founders of the modern Vorin church had such an injury, possibly female, and may have tried to hide it through pouches or sleeves. This might have triggered a kind of fashion shift, leading to it being widely taken up by the women of Vorin lands.

Another possibility is that it was actually a punishment or means of control over the female population. Vorin culture is all about gender roles and it may have been a totalitarian move (like the Hierocracy?) where if a woman was getting too masculine or muscling into male turf, she would be met with a shardblade through the hand to put her in her place.

I'm leaning towards the latter. The difficulty is in the timing. I don't know when safehands became a thing. If they were prominent when the gender roles were codified, then I feel like my theory is licked, because we know the book that defined those roles predates horses' arrival on Roshar, and the only blades in that time period were the honorbades (maybe) and the dawnshards (whatever they may be).

So, are safehands based on shardblade injuries?",Stormlight_Archive,A safehand theory (related to shards?)

I think it's also established earlier that highstorms are violent enough to toss boulders and small trees, so wouldn't the building materials mentioned above also be susceptible to getting blown away by storms?

Just a few more.

Almost there.

Okay, prolly safe now.

...

So here are my two theories. Maybe they've been talked to death, maybe they've been proven false.

First, simplest. I think Navani's mysterious penpal is Sja-Anat. Not really gonna explain it, once you think it through I think the reasoning is pretty obvious.

Second. I think Ialai isn't dead. I think she's a Lightweaver, and a Ghostblood agent.

She doesn't really fit as a Son of Honor. She never had that religious fervor, she wouldn't really want the Heralds back. I think her joining them was her assignment as a Ghostblood. I think she was the one who killed the other two rulers and left herself as the only person in charge. I think the Ghostbloods wanted the Sons of Honor done, so they made Ialai one of them, had her kill the competition, and then had her conveniently tie up her own loose end so it wouldn't seem suspicious when it was over. Control of the Warcamps was never really going to help the Ghostbloods so she's off to her next assignment now. She got together all the stuff the Sons knew about Shadesmar to help with their ultimate plans, and used Shallan to make her exit in a way that would lead no one in Dalinar's camp wondering where she went or what happened to the Sons. She was a much better fit for the Ghostbloods than the Sons, anyway.

The how is simple. Between illusions and Stormlight she just faked her own death. They mention that blackbane is usually ingested but then simply dismiss it without checking any of the wine she just drank, and just assume she must have been stabbed without looking for a stabwound. Both seem very sloppy, and obvious oversights. It was also very conspicuous how she and Shallan shared several vintages, but then Ialai made a point of being the only one to drink from the final container. I believe that was how she drank her own poison.

Then she just waited for it to kick in, and drew in just enough Stormlight to keep herself alive without actually healing her. So her organs shut down, her heart stopped, and when they checked her pulse there was nothing. Just like how Jasnah survived after a knife was left in her heart, or Shallan when there was a quarrel through her brain. Just enough to survive the experience without actually healing the wound.

They don't talk about where the corpse went. It would not have been difficult for her to get access to a dead body, I assume. Between lightweaving and soulcasting it wouldn't be too difficult to make a body look a lot like her own, especially if people weren't really going to examine it too closely. Shallan's squires and Adolin's guards are beyond reproach but we know they passed off her body eventually, and it is not beyond the Ghostbloods to have agents at the waystation on the Plains.

One weird ancillary note. Shallan notices upon touching Ialai that she feels an unexpected spike of revulsion. She explains it away because of their history, but why then would it be unexpected? It reminds me of how &gt;!Vin felt animosity from the mists!&lt;. I think something in Shallan recognized something Invested in Ialai and provoked a reaction which felt like disgust, and Shallan confused it for her own feelings, just like the example above.

Shallan notes that Mraize enjoys never actually lying. Well, he also never confirmed that Ialai was killed by anyone, let alone that he's got an agent in Shallan's group. He says he doesn't have an agent in Adolin's guards, and when Shallan asks him directly, he says, I really light Lightweavers. Shallan goes on to assume this means he's got a spy among her squires, which is one of those leaps that always strikes me as conspicuous, when characters assume something no one ever said.

It reminds me of how the people in Bands of Mourning just assumed that &gt;!the Sovereign was Rashek!&lt;. No one ever said he was. Allyk made a vague reference, and they even talked about how unlikely it was. But for some reason they all just assumed it and moved forward. My personal surprise when it turned out not to be the case was nil, and it was all set up in a scene exactly like this.

Anyway. That's my theory. Ialai is alive and a Ghostblood. And Sja-anat user her powers to hijack a spanreed and chat with Navani.",Stormlight_Archive,RHYTHM OF WAR spoilers inside. Two aluminum hat theories

1863,"I used to read SOOOO many books in elementary school and middle school. For those of you who live in America, you may remember AR points - I accumulated SO many. It got to the point where I was reading multiple grades above the average reading level. I think I read all of LotR when I was 12-13. 

Then, I got to high school, and I started reading less, but I did still read. My freshman year of high school is when I discovered Harry Potter, but that was the only book series I read regularly for a couple of years. By senior year, I had almost fallen off of reading altogether, but being in my AP English class inspired me to start reading a handful of classics. 

After that came college, and I will be honest here - almost 100% of the reading I did during that time was just for classes. I just didn’t feel like reading for fun anymore. I tried to start A Song of Ice and Fire because my mom loved the series, but I didn’t even get halfway through A Game of Thrones before getting tired of it. I did managed to reread Harry Potter for the third time my junior year, but that was it. 

Now we come to the year 2020. I was in my last semester of grad school in the spring, and in January, I rewatched Avatar: The Last Airbender (my favorite fantasy TV series of all time) for like the tenth time. My interest in the series reignited, and I discovered there was an official YA novel focused on Avatar Kyoshi, so I picked it up and read it in a week (I throughly recommend this duology if you’re an AtLA fan). I didn’t read another book again until the second novel in the Kyoshi duology came out in July. 

After finishing that, I decided I wanted to try and pick up reading regularly again since I was done with grad school. I tried reading the first two Percy Jackson books, but they didn’t really pull me in. But then, I saw the booktuber Merphy Napier (who I found from her AtLA reviews) included The Stormlight Archive in her top 10 favorite book series list and it piqued my interest. I quickly ordered Way of Kings so that I could judge for myself how good the series was. 

YOU GUYS. I almost immediately became hooked. I literally read that book in a WEEK. And it’s over a thousand pages!!! I’m not sure if I’ve ever read a book that long that quickly before. Usually, it takes me awhile to get into the book, and unless I’m really grabbed by it, I won’t end up finishing it.

I don’t know how, but Sanderson did it. He brought back my joy of reading. I just finished Words of Radiance yesterday after a little over a week of reading. I’m reading Edgedancer now before jumping into Oathbringer. I love these characters so much and the magic system and world are both so engaging and interesting. I also LOVE the diversity of the races! It’s not just variations of white people lol!

I’m now 100% committed to getting back into reading, and I’m diving in head first with Fantasy, which has always been my favorite genre. I ended up picking up the first Mistborn trilogy, the first Kingkiller Chronicles book, and the first Gentleman Bastard book, which I’m so excited to read as well. I even ordered Elantris and Warbreaker, which are set to arrive Monday. I really want to read all of the books in the Cosmere!

So yep. There you have it. Sanderson managed to hook a person who hasn’t read for fun in years and hasn’t read adult high fantasy since Lord of the Rings in middle school. Also, I’m so glad I started reading The Stormlight Archive right now because this means I’ll only have to wait a little over a month until Rhythm of War is released lol - I already preordered it!",Stormlight_Archive,Way of Kings is the book that has gotten me back into reading for fun again for the first time in over 5 years!

We learn in Oathbringer that the Oathpact keeps the spirits of the Fused on Braize until the Herald's will breaks, releasing the spirits to come to Roshar and start a Desolation. However, what *ends* a Desolation? 

Is it just diminishing the Listener population so thoroughly that the Fused run out of willing vessels? That doesn't fit with the idea that the Desolations were coming every couple of years leading up to the Recreance. 

Do the deaths of the Heralds close the passageway from Braize, once against trapping the Fused? The doesn't make sense either, otherwise the smart thing to do would be for at least one or two Heralds to just die immediately to stop the Fused from cycling during a Desolation. 

Is there some kind of time limit, a duration during with the gates are open but after which the gates close again? That would mean ""winning"" Desolation really just means stalling out and trying to do damage control until things quiet naturally.

1899,"The epigraph of chapter 13 talked about splitting gemstones and the  spren inside of them and howthe two halves work identically and in  tandem. This was explained in the same chapter that Mraize says he has a  method for removing Stormlight from the Rosharan system. I'm curious if splitting a fabrial/spren is involved in the plan Mraize has set in motion.

If this line of speculation is true, then Mraize is likely trying to build some kind of  fabrial, and that fabrial would likely have an enclosure made of nicrosil, since that’s the metal involved in the Metallic Arts that interacts with Investiture.  

Iyatil, Mraize’s *babsk*, is of Southern Scadrian heritage (though she wasn’t born there). They’re the ones who know about Excisors, which enables them to create unsealed metalminds - Feruchemical devices made of nicrosil and another metal that lets *anyone* use the Feruchemical abilities stored in the second metal.

It’s possible that Iyatil’s connections to the Southern Scadrians and their technology is going to interact with fabrial technology, since we’ve seen in other epigraphs that the same metals from the Metallic Arts are ALSO involved in making specific kinds of fabrials. It stands to reason that nicrosil would also interact with a fabrial, AND the spren inside of it. Whatever effect that could have may also be multiplied if it’s a twinborn nicrosil Misting/Ferring who can Compound the metals. 

Since we don’t know how nicrosil really works (apparently even nicrosil Mistings/Ferrings barely know how it works) I don’t know the mechanics of this, but knowing what we do about Realmatic theory and the Investiture technology of both Scadrial and Roshar, I’m guessing there’s a decent possibility nicrosil is involved in Mraize’s plan.

Lastly, if nicrosil and/or Excisors are involved in Mraize's plan, then it's also possible that Kelsier is somehow involved in the Ghostblood's plans, since he's the one who introduced Excisors to the Southern Scadrians in the first place.",Stormlight_Archive,[ROW/Mistborn] Possible connection between the Ghostbloods and the Metallic arts

Earlier in the book, there's a comment that the Aimian Oathgate was likely destroyed in the past (related to the Scouring), and all the other Oathgates are (more or less) accounted for.

So. Could there be a rogue Oathgate set up somewhere not in a capital city? Could someone have (either in the initial Scouring or later) stolen the stones and set up somewhere else?

The other big question from this, is could they have been set up anywhere? Are the Oathgate spren tied to their original location? Could you in theory, take those spren to Ashyn or Braize and set up a Stargate system?

So I'm finishing up my WoK reread and I got to the section where Kaladin starts playing dress up with Parshendi ... uniforms :v

And I was just sort of idly considering Venli's reaction to that, when/if she ever learns of it.

And I realised I have seen that reaction. When the Parsheni ancestors/void bringers posess her friends and former lover.

More than that though, I realized why, that particular act is a cultural scar not only for Parshendi but also for the enslaved Parshmen. It's mentioned that one the only ways to provoke Parshmen slaves is to mess about with their dead.

My hypothesis is that as much as both groups have forgotten, beyond even the Parshendi stories of the terrible enslavement by their 'Gods'. They remember at a deep level the awful violation of their people's possession, which informs their prohibition against moving their dead. And why they have such a visceral, furious reaction to anyone who breaksthe taboo.

1943,"**Major's POV (Book main characters)**

**- Kaladin:** Unhealthy ISFP. Don't really need to explain

**- Shallan:** Unhealthy ENTP (constantly ignoring her Ti side), her personas are ISTP for Veil and ISTJ for Radiant. People who think she as INFP couldn't be more wrong. INFP are know for being honest with their feellings, INFP will experience the word trough their feellings and how their experiences relates with their personal values. Shallan doesn't look like this at all not even Veil or Radiant, her feellings are alien to herself. When she has freedom she choose to learn, to understand. When Mraize teases her with knowledge, it's the ultimate ENTP desire, to seek new possibilities.

**- Dalinar:** Before memory loss unhealthy ESTJ, after his breakdown ENFJ. I know everybody will disagree but he's idealistic, people-oriented, future-oriented, honest, tolerant and charismatic. He has just all good qualities ENFJ are know for. He's definitely not a Te-dom (ENTJ or ESTJ) as many people might think. Most important, he is a BONDSMITH. It's hard to see Blackthorn as Pious, but he is. This is what his arc was about, a heartless monster becoming a truly benevolent man.

**- Venli:** We had few chapters of her book so far, but based of her POVs I would say unhealthy ESTP. She is a person of loose morals who is more concerned to fulfill her immediate hunger for power and knowledge. Her  obsession with experience and novelty can be either Ne or Se but I'm leaning towards ESTP because she doesn't seem very detached from physical world;

**- Szeth:** Unhealthy ISFJ, his book will come out only if few years but based on his chapters on past books I'm pretty sure he's an ISFJ, all about him is his very subjective understanding of his past experiences and shared values by his community to a point he just went insane for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Minor's POV**

**- Adolin:** ESTP, very healthy one

**- Jasnah:** ENTJ, at first I thought she is INTJ, but in book 3 she was pretty ENTJ for me and I stand by this side now

**- Navani:** ESTJ. She's a woman who likes warcamps just because they are organized shows how Te-dom she is. The sensor vs intuitive contrast between her and her ENTJ daughter is really evident. While both are very controlling people who enjoys order and clear goals and structure, Navani is much more straightforward and interested in practical and tangible fields of studies than Jasnah.

**- Taravangian:** INFJ in his natural/average state. INTJ when he's on some of his genius moments. Taravangian is so clearly Ni-user that his blessing from Nightwatcher actually **is about it**, making unclear connections figure out some kind of world holistic scope. I can't think a fiction character more INxJ than him as his cognition is a fundamental part of his narrative

**- Lift:** ESFP, a very benevolent one

\- **Eshonai:** This was hard to figure out. So far leaning towards ISTP, her flashback series on 4th book will help or just deconstruct my view about her

**- Hoid:** ENTP, almost a meme one

Timbre pulsed decisively. She had a point. Perhaps the humans could train Venli. Maybe she could capture one of their Radiants and make them teach her.

At any rate, she needed to prepare her staff to leave the city. Her recruitment efforts would have to be put on hold. Like it or not, she was going to be at the forefront of another invasion of the human lands.

&gt;!I'm starting to piece some stuff together. When Kaladin becomes so strong in the battles with Bridge Four, he draws strength from stormlight, just like our dear liberty-forfeit assassin-in-white. Had suspected it for a while, got it confirmed with the storm incident. What the hell happened when everything turned black and he saw that face? Is it Father Storm or something? Is it something related with Odium? Syl clearly was triggered when mentioned of him, and the highstorm attracts windspren, correct? So interesting. Kaladin is Stormblessed indeed. Also, no wonder he hates bright eyes so much. Poor man killed a shardbearer and got the mark for it.!&lt;

&gt;!I was really drawn by Shallan's story. Missed her in Part II, and really liked this part. I can't remember when she drew the angle-faced people for the first time, but I think it happened right before her stealing Jasnah's soulcaster. I assume those are the souls of people. Are those also spren? Who knows. I am also starting to suspect that the Soulcasters are not actually changed, and Jasnah kept the good one. Or there is ""no good one"", and soulcasting depends on the person and not the soulcaster (maybe the reason Shallan drew a angle-faced before stealing the soulcaster). I may be wrong. Speaking about Jasnah, I absolutely adoooore her. What a woman. I really do hope to see more of her, and keeps Shallan as her apprentice. Didn't care much about Kabsal, and wasn't sad to see him go.!&lt;

&gt;!I think there's a conflict brewing and soon it will be war. Dalinar's visions, Jasnah's investigations about Voidbringers and Szeth's new master seem to hint at the advent of a new Desolation or something. Also, having Bridge Four started to train with spear, it makes sense that they will fight soon, not just run with the bridge. And there's also the tension between Sadeas and Dalinar's saga.

So if an Edgedancer removed the friction from a windrunners whole body, that would give the windrunner zero air friction meaning he would only accelerate. This can be compounded by adding momentum to the windrunner before take off.

Like, you have and edgedancer strapped to the back of a windrunner, load them into a trebuchet, launch them towards there destination, ED removes friction from the two of them while WR lashes themselves forward, no air friction means all of the trebuchets speed is preserved throughout the trip which would allow for much faster travel for in theory less Stormlight.",Stormlight_Archive,Could an Edgedancer and Windrunner team up to acheive high speed low cost flight?

SPOILERS FOR OATHBRINGER FROM HERE ON OUT 

&gt;!Hypothesis: Kaladin takes Jezrien's place as Windrunner Herald, reforming the Oathpact and ~protecting~ all of Roshar, maybe by swearing the 5th ideal, idk. 

Supporting evidence:

1. The Stormfather calls only Kaladin ""Son of Tanavast"", as well as Son of Honor (he also calls others, such as Dalinar I believe, Son of Honor but only Kaladin Son of Tanavast. WOB confirms that this is significant. 

2. In WOK, many of the bridgemen and characters remark on how Kaladin carries himself like a ""Bright Lord"" and when this upsets Kaladin, Sigzil explains that in other places where there are no lighteyes it just means ""leader"" and that's likely what the men mean. I believe one of the Kholins or Zahel also uses the specific word ""leader"" to describe Kaladin. When Taln is saying his speech on the Return of the Voidbringers in front of Ehlokar in a interlude in WOR, being questioned on where a darkeyed homeless man got his shard blade, he specifically says that ""Jezrien... he will teach you leadership"" 

3. Obviously, Jezrien was a Windrunner and Kaladin is a Windrunner, bonded to the Ancient Daughter, one of the few Honorspren that the Stormfather himself created.

4. Kaladin said in WOR --and this is what finally made me put it all together and form this theory-- when talking to Renarin about training him for Bridge Four, ""If the afterlife really is a big war, then I hope I end up in damnation. At least there I might be able to get a wink or two of sleep"" and I think this is top notch foreshadowing on Brandon's part.

5. Kaladin suffers so WELL. He really do be the best at suffering and so who better than to suffer torture on Braize 

6. That would be a really satisfying kind of play on the forces of good and evil and how Moash and Kaladin both hated Lighteyes because of wrongs that were done to their families, and how Kaladin chose the path of honor and good and Moash chose the path of giving in to evil and vengeance and how he KILLED Jezrien, Herald of War, and Kaladin ascended in his place !&lt;",Stormlight_Archive,Theory on Kaladin's journey

The conversation between Dalinar and Ahu got me thinking about the Unmade. Specifically the part where Ahu says (paraphrasing) ""I used to think that it wasn't our fault, but we let them in.""

Is it possible that the nine Unmade are shadows or corruptions of the nine Heralds who broke the Oathpact?

It could be that the Heralds' strange behaviour in the present is a way of avoiding the influence of their specific Unmade, or that they are all being influenced and controlled by those Unmade.

Ashertman, for example, seems to focus on influencing the nobility to ignore responsibilities and focus on indulgence - who better to influence in this way than the Herald of Kings.

Alternatively, we know that liquor is one way of avoiding the guilt caused by succumbing to the influence of Nergaoul - could this be when Jezrien is doing.

Also anyone who is not European but know some good sites to preorder RoW, with shipping price lower than the price of selling my soul to Brando Sando",Stormlight_Archive,RoW pre-order to Europe
1988,"So something I've been thinking bout for a while now is what To shad an fabrics and clothes are made out of. Most of the animals on the planet are crustaceans, so its not like wool is a likely option( its also unlikely that many cultures would need heavy winter wear, considering Roshar's mild climate, but still). Also,I'm not sure if fibrous plants like cotton could survive high storms, but maybe I'm wrong.

So does anyone have any idea? Has Sanderson mentioned something bout this before? I really love his world building but can't help but feel like this a spot he forgot to give proper thought to.",Stormlight_Archive,What are Disharmony clothes made out of?

1992,"I can't stop thinking about the end of OB, where Dalinar hears a voice say ""Unite them!"" shortly before opening up the perpendicularity.  I know that a popular--and probably correct--theory is that Dalinar will become the vessel for the Shard Unity.  I can buy into that.  However...

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't that seem a little too predictable?  Would Brandon really reveal something like that in book 3 of a ten book series?  I don't think so.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Dalinar is something different.  I think Odium will be ""defeated"" after book 5, and the story will shift in a MAJOR way.  The first five are all about Roshar and the conflicts between its people.  The back 5 will be the culmination of the Cosmere that we've been waiting for.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think Dalinar, as well as many of our current characters and certainly some new ones, is going to set out on a mission to piece back together Adonalsium.  Why?  Doesn't it make sense?  The constant conflict between Shards has caused massive problems throughout the Cosmere.  However, we don't really know why exactly Adonalsium was shattered in the first place.  I'm among the belief that 16 individuals simply wanted power, not the good of the Cosmere.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Hoid is on a mission to do the exact opposite.  Hoid doesn't want Adonalsium to return.  As much as I love his character, I would absolutely love the see him as an antagonist.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry that was a lot longer than I anticipated.",Stormlight_Archive,Hoid/Wit will be one of the main villains of the back five books. (Theory)
1993," The Sibling is non-binary. 

Thats all.

Based on this WoB:

&gt;  
&gt;In OB, you explained that the Singers have four sexes. I was wondering... Can the Singers have genders other than those four, like humans? Even as simple as just not going with male, female, or malen/femalen. Could a transgender Singer use their ability to shift forms to change their biological reality? And, finally, could a Spren be non-binary, if it wasn't personified in a typical male/female way?   
&gt;  
&gt;Brandon Sanderson  
&gt;  
&gt;In the cosmere as a whole, a person's perception of themselves has a lot of power over both their Spiritual and Physical forms. It is possible, with Investiture, to change their biology to match Cognitive perceptions--and while this could be easier for some races (like the Singers) it's not outside plausibility for any race. **There are non-binary spren, actually--and you should be meeting one important one quite soon in the books.**
